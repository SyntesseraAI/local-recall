The memories directory exists but only has a `.gitkeep` file - no actual memory files. The user is correct that there are no memories stored yet.

1. Help them create some initial memories using the MCP tools
2. Explain that the system is set up but no memories have been created yet

Let me provide a clear response about the current state.
