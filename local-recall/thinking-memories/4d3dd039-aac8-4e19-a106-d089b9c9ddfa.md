The user wants help figuring out what needs to be built for the Local Recall project. Let me explore the codebase to understand what's already implemented vs what's documented but not yet built.

I should look at:
1. The src/ directory to see what's implemented
2. The tests/ directory to see what's tested
3. Compare against what's documented in CLAUDE.md

Let me do some exploration to understand the current state.
