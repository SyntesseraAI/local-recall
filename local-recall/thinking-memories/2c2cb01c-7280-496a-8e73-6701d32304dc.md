The build succeeded. Let me verify the changes are working by looking at the built output or running a quick test. Actually, let me just verify the flow:

1. When a session starts, the session-start hook is called
2. It creates an `IndexManager` and calls `searchEngine.getRelevantForSession()`
3. The search engine calls `indexManager.getIndex()`
4. `getIndex()` now always calls `ensureGitignore()` first
5. `ensureGitignore()` creates the base directory if needed, and creates `.gitignore` if it doesn't exist

This should work correctly now. The `.gitignore` will be created:
- On every session start (when `getIndex()` is called)
- When building the index (through `ensureDir()` → `ensureGitignore()`)

The changes are complete.
