Looking at the current implementation, `syncTranscripts()` already has logic to skip copying if the local file exists and has an mtime >= the source's lastModified. However, it only checks mtime and not size. 

The user's request is:
1. Skip copying if file already exists AND mtime AND size are unchanged
2. If mtime OR size has changed → move the file and mark for reprocessing

Let me also look at how processed-log works to understand the reprocessing mechanism.
