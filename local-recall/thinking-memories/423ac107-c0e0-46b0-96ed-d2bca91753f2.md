Now I understand the issues:

1. **SessionStart hook timing out**: The hook initializes the vector store and embedding service, which downloads a 133MB model on first use. The session-start hook has a timeout (likely 30 seconds based on CLAUDE.md), and this initialization is taking longer than that. The AbortError indicates the operation was aborted due to timeout.

2. **Gitignore missing `memory.sqlite`**: The vector store creates a `memory.sqlite` file in the `local-recall` directory, but the gitignore doesn't include it.

Let me check the gitignore.ts file to see how it generates the gitignore, and then fix both issues:
- Add `memory.sqlite` to the gitignore
- The session-start hook needs to be more resilient to slow initialization - either by deferring heavy work or by catching timeouts gracefully.

Let me check the gitignore utility first.
