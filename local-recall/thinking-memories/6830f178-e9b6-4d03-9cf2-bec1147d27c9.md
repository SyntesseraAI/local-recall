  Very interesting! The log shows: 1. `UserPromptSubmit: Extracted keywords:
  information, stew,...

Very interesting! The log shows:

1. `UserPromptSubmit: Extracted keywords: information, stew, context`
2. `Keyword search found 5 results for "information stew context"`
3. `UserPromptSubmit: Found 5 relevant memories`
4. `UserPromptSubmit hook completed successfully`

So the hook IS finding results and IS outputting them - but I'm not seeing them in my context. The hook outputs to stdout (lines 109-120 in the code), which should be injected into my context.

The issue must be that the stdout from the hook isn't being properly injected into Claude's context. The log shows the hook completed successfully and found 5 memories, but I only see:

```
<system-reminder>
UserPromptSubmit:Callback hook success: Success
</system-reminder>
```

So there's something wrong with how the hook output is being captured/injected. Either:
1. The hook infrastructure isn't capturing stdout properly
2. There's some configuration issue
3. The output is being captured but not displayed in the format I can see

This is a real issue - the hook is working (finding memories) but the context injection isn't happening. The user should investigate the hooks configuration or how Claude Code handles hook stdout.
