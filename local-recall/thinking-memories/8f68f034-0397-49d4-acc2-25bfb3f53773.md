No local settings.json. The hooks are clearly running (as evidenced by the logs), but their stdout isn't being injected into context. The "Success" message I'm seeing appears to be a wrapper/confirmation message rather than the actual hook output.

Looking at what I see:
```
<system-reminder>
UserPromptSubmit:Callback hook success: Success
</system-reminder>
```

This seems to be a standardized response format indicating the hook ran successfully, but the actual stdout from the hook (the memory content) isn't being passed through.

This could be:
1. A Claude Code behavior - maybe hooks output isn't injected directly but wrapped
2. A configuration option needed to enable stdout passthrough
3. The plugin setup might need something else

The user should investigate the Claude Code documentation for how hook stdout is supposed to be injected, or check if there's an issue with the plugin infrastructure.
