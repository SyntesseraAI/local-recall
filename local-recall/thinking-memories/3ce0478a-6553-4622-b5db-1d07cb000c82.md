The user is asking about the "thinking index" functionality and what was added to my context. Let me look at what was injected into my context from the system reminders.

Looking at the system reminders, I can see there's a section called "Local Recall: Previous Thoughts" that contains 5 relevant thinking excerpts from previous sessions. These are thinking memories that were retrieved based on semantic search.

The thinking memories that were injected are:

1. About searching for memories and listing all to find related content (67% similarity)
2. About updating memory_list response to show correct fields (67% similarity)
3. About improving logic for what content is "memory worthy" (67% similarity)
4. About checking memories when there don't seem to be any (67% similarity)
5. About searching for "stew" in memories (66% similarity)

These all seem related to the memory/recall system itself, which makes sense since my current context is about the local-recall project.

The user wants to know how well this thinking index works. I should explain what I see and maybe assess the relevance/quality.
