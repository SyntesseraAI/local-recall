I found the issues:

1. **Gitignore issue**: The source code in `gitignore.ts` already has the correct SQLite patterns, but the `ensureGitignore` function only creates the file if it doesn't exist. The existing `local-recall/.gitignore` file was created before the SQLite patterns were added, so it needs to be manually updated.

2. **SessionStart hook timing out**: The hook is initializing the embedding model which downloads ~133MB on first use. This takes too long for a hook. The session-start hook should be lightweight and not block on heavy initialization.

Let me fix both:

1. Update the existing gitignore file directly
2. Make the session-start hook skip vector store initialization (defer to MCP server or user-prompt-submit)
