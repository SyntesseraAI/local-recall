Now I have a clear picture:

**MCP Server Status:**
- **Running**: Yes (PID 4524)
- **Path**: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/mcp-server/server.js`
- **Configuration**: Located at `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.mcp.json`

**What's happening:**
- The MCP server is configured and running from a plugin subdirectory (`dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/`)
- The main project root (`/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/`) doesn't have the built `scripts/` directory yet
- This appears to be a development setup where there's a separate plugin directory for testing

I should summarize this clearly for the user.
