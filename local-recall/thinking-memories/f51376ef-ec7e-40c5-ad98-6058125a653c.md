Still waiting after about 6 seconds. The process started but it's hanging. Let me wait a bit longer and check again. The issue is that the claude process spawned but is not producing any output.

Actually, I wonder if the issue is that the spawned child process is somehow inheriting some state or environment from the parent process that's causing it to hang. Let me kill this and try with different options.
