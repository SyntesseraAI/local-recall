Good progress. Let me mark the second todo as completed and mark the third one as in progress. But wait, looking at the code again - the `analyzeForMemories` function already handles `message.thinking` properly, since we're now parsing the raw messages into the normalized `TranscriptMessage` format with the `thinking` field extracted. Let me verify that the existing `analyzeForMemories` function is already correct.
