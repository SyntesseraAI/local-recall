Now I understand the current implementation. The user wants to:
1. Remove USER_TRIGGER_PATTERNS
2. Remove AUTO_DETECT_PATTERNS
3. Save ALL messages instead of filtering

The main changes will be in `src/utils/transcript.ts`:
- Remove the pattern constants
- Simplify `analyzeForMemories` to just convert all messages to memory suggestions

Let me make these changes. The function should:
1. Take all messages
2. Convert each one to a memory with the role prefix
3. No filtering at all

Let me also update the stop.ts if needed - looking at it, it just calls analyzeForMemories, so the main change is in transcript.ts.

Let me create a todo list and make the changes.
