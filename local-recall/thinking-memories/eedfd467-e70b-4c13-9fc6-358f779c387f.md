The user wants:
- `occurred_at` - when the event happened in the conversation
- Timestamp (I think they mean `created_at` - when the memory was written)
- Content hash for deduplication

So the dedup key would be: occurred_at + content hash

This means:
1. Each memory has `occurred_at` (from transcript), `created_at` (when written), and a content hash
2. Before creating a new memory, check if one exists with the same `occurred_at` + content hash
3. If it exists, skip

Let me confirm this understanding and also clarify what changes need to happen to the codebase.
