Now I need to:

1. Update the stop.ts to include "thinking" content blocks as well as "text"
2. Simplify the analyzeForMemories function to just store the full message with role

Let me also think about how to format the memory content. The user wants to store messages with role, so maybe the content should be something like:

```
**user**: <message content>
```

or 

```
**assistant**: <message content>
```

Let me update the code.
