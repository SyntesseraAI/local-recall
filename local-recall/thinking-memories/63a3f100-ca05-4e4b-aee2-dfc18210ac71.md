Aha! So:

1. The built script exists at `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/user-prompt-submit.js`
2. But there's no `.claude/` directory in this project, which means the hooks must be configured elsewhere (probably globally or in the parent settings)
3. The SessionStart hook IS working, but UserPromptSubmit is not firing

The issue is that the UserPromptSubmit hook is not configured. The SessionStart hook is working (we can see it in the logs and it ran at the start of this session), but the UserPromptSubmit hook never fires.

Let me provide a summary to the user about what's working and what's not.
