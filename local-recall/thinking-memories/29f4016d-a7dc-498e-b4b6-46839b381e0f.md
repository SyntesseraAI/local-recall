I see. The tools.ts still uses IndexManager for the `index_rebuild` tool and for refreshing the index after memory creation. But with vector search, we should:

1. Update the SearchEngine constructor since it no longer needs IndexManager
2. Update `memory_search` description to reflect vector search
3. Keep `index_rebuild` but also add a way to rebuild the vector store

Let me update tools.ts to reflect the new vector-based search approach.
