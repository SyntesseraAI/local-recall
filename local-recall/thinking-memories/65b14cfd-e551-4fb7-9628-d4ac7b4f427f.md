Now I have a clear picture. Looking at the server.ts file:

1. The daemon only runs `runTranscriptProcessing()` from `memory-extractor.js` - this is for **episodic memory** extraction
2. The `runThinkingExtraction()` function exists in `thinking-extractor.ts` but it is **NOT** called anywhere in the daemon loop

So the answer is: **No, thinking memory extraction does NOT currently run in parallel with episodic memory** - in fact, thinking memory extraction is not being run at all by the daemon. Only episodic memory extraction is scheduled.

The code for thinking extraction exists (`ThinkingExtractor` class with `runThinkingExtraction` function), but it's not integrated into the MCP server's daemon loop.

Let me verify this is the complete picture by checking if there's any other place where thinking extraction might be called.
