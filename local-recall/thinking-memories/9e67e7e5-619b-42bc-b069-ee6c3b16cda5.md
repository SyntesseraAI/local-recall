Looking at the code, I can see:

1. There's a `findDuplicate` method that checks for duplicate memories based on `occurred_at` + `content_hash`
2. The `createMemory` method is idempotent - it won't create duplicates
3. There's a `maxMemories` config option mentioned in the CLAUDE.md (defaults to 1000)

But I don't see any compaction, merging, or automatic cleanup logic. Let me check the config to see if maxMemories is enforced anywhere.
