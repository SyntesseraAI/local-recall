The user wants to create two environment variables to control the memory systems:
1. Episodic memory - default OFF
2. Thinking memory - default ON

I need to:
1. First, understand the current configuration setup
2. Add the env variables to the config
3. Update the hooks to respect these settings

Let me start by reading the config utility and the hooks to understand the current setup.
