Good! I've created the `.claude/settings.json` file with all three hooks configured:
- SessionStart
- UserPromptSubmit
- Stop

And also the MCP server configuration. Now the hooks should be configured locally for this project. The user will need to reload or restart their Claude Code session for the UserPromptSubmit hook to start working.
