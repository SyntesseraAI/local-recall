The user wants me to copy the hook configuration locally. This means I should create a `.claude/settings.json` file in the local-recall project directory with the hook configuration for UserPromptSubmit (and possibly all the hooks).

Looking at the architecture, the hooks should be configured to point to the built scripts in `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/`.

Let me create the `.claude/settings.json` file with the proper hook configuration.
