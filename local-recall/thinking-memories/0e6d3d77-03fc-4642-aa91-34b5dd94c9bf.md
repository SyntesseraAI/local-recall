Now I understand the current behavior. Looking at the `analyzeForMemories` function (lines 140-178), I can see:

1. It only saves assistant messages (skips user messages)
2. It skips empty messages
3. It skips single-line messages (line 166: `if (lines.length < 2) continue;`)

The user wants me to:
1. Save all thinking, even if it's single-line
2. Only save multiline answers

Looking at the TranscriptMessage type, I need to check what fields it has. Let me also check the types file to understand if there's a thinking field.
