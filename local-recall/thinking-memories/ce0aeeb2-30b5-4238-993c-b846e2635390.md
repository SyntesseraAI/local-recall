Looking at the code, I can see that in `processAllTranscripts()` (lines 401-424 of memory-extractor.ts), the transcripts are processed sequentially in a for loop:

```typescript
for (const transcript of transcripts) {
  const result = await this.processTranscript(transcript);
  results.push(result);
}
```

To run 10 extractors at a time, I need to add a concurrency option and change this to process transcripts in parallel with a limit. I can use a simple chunking approach or a proper concurrency limiter.

Let me add a `concurrency` option to the `ExtractorOptions` interface and modify the `processAllTranscripts` method to process multiple transcripts in parallel.
