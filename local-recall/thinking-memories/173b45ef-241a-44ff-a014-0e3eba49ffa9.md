Now I have everything I need to create the thinking-extractor.ts. The key insight is that I can directly extract thinking blocks from the JSONL transcript without calling Claude CLI.

The flow will be:
1. Sync transcripts from Claude cache
2. For each transcript (20 in parallel):
   - Check if needs processing via thinking-processed-log
   - Parse JSONL and extract all thinking blocks
   - For each thinking block, create a ThinkingMemory   - Record in thinking-processed-log

Let me create the thinking-extractor.ts now.
