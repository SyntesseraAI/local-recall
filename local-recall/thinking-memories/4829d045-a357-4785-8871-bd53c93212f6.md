The user just said "hello!" - this is a simple greeting. According to my instructions, I should not use the todo list for simple, conversational tasks. I should just respond in a friendly but concise manner.

I should avoid using emojis unless the user explicitly requests them. I should keep my response short and concise since this is a CLI interface.
