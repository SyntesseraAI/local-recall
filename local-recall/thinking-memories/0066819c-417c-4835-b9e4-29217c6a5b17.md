No memory markdown files exist. The git status at the start of the conversation showed untracked memory files, but they seem to have been removed or never actually existed. The index.json has data but the actual memory files are missing.

This explains why searches return nothing - the index references memories that don't exist as files.

For testing purposes, let me create a test memory to verify the hook works, and then move on to the documentation.
