The user is saying "it seems like it is now" - meaning they think the Stop hook IS working now. This is interesting! Let me check the log file to see if there's been any change.

I should check the recall.log file to see if Stop hooks have started firing. If they have, then maybe:
1. Something changed in the VS Code extension
2. The hook was configured differently
3. Something in the settings was fixed

Let me read the log file to confirm.
