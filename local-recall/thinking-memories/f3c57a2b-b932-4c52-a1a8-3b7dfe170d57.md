I see there are old functions that are now unused:
- `generateSubject(category: string, content: string)` - the old one with category prefix
- `generateKeywords(category: string, content: string)` - the old category-based keywords
- `extractContextAroundMatch` - no longer needed since we store full messagesI need to remove these. Also I have a naming conflict - I created a new `generateSubject(content: string)` function but there's still the old `generateSubject(category: string, content: string)`. Let me remove the old unused functions.
