The user wants me to update code related to saving "thinking" and "answers". This sounds like it's related to the transcript parsing functionality in the local-recall project. Let me look at the relevant code to understand what's being saved and how.

Based on the CLAUDE.md, the transcript parsing is in `src/utils/transcript.ts`. I should look at that file to understand the current behavior and then modify it.

Let me read the transcript.ts file first.
