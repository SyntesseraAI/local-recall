The user wants to work on improving the logic for what content is considered "memory worthy". Let me look at the current implementation in the `analyzeForMemories` function in `src/utils/transcript.ts` to understand the current approach.

From what I read earlier, the current approach uses simple regex patterns to look for keywords like:
- decision, chose, approach, strategy, pattern
- fixed, solved, solution, resolved
- configured, setting, config, environment
- convention, pattern, always, never, standard, rule
- important, note, remember, don't forget

This is a fairly naive approach. The user probably wants something more sophisticated or different.

Let me ask them what direction they want to take this, or explore what they have in mind.
