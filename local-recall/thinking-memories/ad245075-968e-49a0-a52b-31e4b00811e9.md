I can see that:
1. There's no `.claude-plugin/` directory
2. There's no `hooks.json` file
3. There's no `.mcp.json` file
4. There's no `scripts/` directory

The documentation in CLAUDE.md shows a different structure than what actually exists. Let me check what's in the `.claude` directory and look at the dist folder structure.
