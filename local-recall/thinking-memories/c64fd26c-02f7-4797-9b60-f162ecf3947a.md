Now let me create the transcript condenser. I need to think about what minimal information is needed for memory extraction:

1. **User messages**: The text of what the user asked - this provides context for what task was being worked on
2. **Assistant text**: What Claude said - key decisions, explanations, conclusions
3. **Tool uses**: What actions were taken - but we don't need full file contents, just:
   - Read: which file was read
   - Edit: which file was edited, and what changed (brief summary)
   - Write: which file was written
   - Bash: what command was run, success/failure
   - Grep/Glob: what was searched for
   - Task: what task was delegated
4. **Tool results**: Success/failure status, brief outcome

The key insight is that for memory extraction, we care about:
- What was the user trying to accomplish?
- What did Claude do?
- What files were touched?
- What was the outcome?

We DON'T need:
- Full file contents (hundreds of lines)
- Full bash output (logs, etc.)
- Thinking blocks (internal reasoning)
- File history snapshots
- Queue operations
- API usage stats

Let me create a condensed event format.
