Now I understand the setup better:

1. The MCP server IS running (PID 4524)
2. It's running from a different path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/mcp-server/server.js`
3. There's a `.mcp.json` at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.mcp.json`
4. The main project root doesn't have a `scripts/` directory yet (hasn't been built)

Let me check the .mcp.json that exists and see the configuration.
