The tarball appears to be corrupted or truncated. The fastembed library downloads the model on first use, so it looks like the download was incomplete. Let me check if there's a way to re-download the model files, or if we should just delete the corrupted cache and let fastembed re-download on next use.

Looking at the fastembed documentation, when FlagEmbedding.init is called, it downloads the model to a local cache directory. The default location varies, but it seems like this project may have configured it to use `local_cache/`.

Let me check if there's any configuration for the fastembed cache location, or we should just delete the corrupted files and let it re-download.
