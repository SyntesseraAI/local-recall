I need to:
1. Remove the time window filtering logic
2. Update the createMemory call to include occurred_at
3. The analyzeForMemories function will need to return an occurred_at timestamp as well

Let me update the transcript parsing loop first to remove the time window filtering, and then update the createMemory call.
