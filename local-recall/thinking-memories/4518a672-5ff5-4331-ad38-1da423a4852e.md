Now I'll add the thinking memory extraction to the daemon. I need to:
1. Import `runThinkingExtraction` from `thinking-extractor.js`
2. Import `ThinkingMemoryManager` and `getThinkingVectorStore` for the thinking vector sync
3. Add a flag for concurrent thinking processing
4. Add a flag for concurrent thinking vector sync
5. Add `runThinkingDaemonProcessing()` function
6. Add `runThinkingVectorSync()` function
7. Update `startDaemonLoop()` to run both in parallel

The thinking extraction doesn't need Claude CLI (it just parses thinking blocks directly from transcripts), so it can run much faster and can run in parallel with the episodic extraction.
