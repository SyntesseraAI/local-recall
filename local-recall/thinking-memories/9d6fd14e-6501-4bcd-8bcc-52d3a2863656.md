The user wants to increase the parallelism of memory extraction from transcripts. Currently, the MCP server runs a background daemon that processes transcripts. I need to find where this is configured and understand the current implementation.

Let me search for the transcript processing code to see how it's currently structured and where the parallelism is controlled.
