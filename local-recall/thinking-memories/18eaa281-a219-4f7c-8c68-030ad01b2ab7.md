The user wants two changes:
1. Round similarity scores to 2 decimal places (e.g., 0.65 instead of 0.6512345)
2. Use recency as a secondary sort or weighting for results with similar scores

Let me look at where the scores are used and where sorting happens. I need to check:
1. vector-store.ts - where scores are calculated
2. Possibly search.ts - where results are returned
3. user-prompt-submit.ts - where results are displayed

The scoring happens in vector-store.ts at line 257. I should modify the search to:
1. Round scores to 2 decimal places
2. Sort by score first, then by occurred_at for ties

Let me make these changes.
