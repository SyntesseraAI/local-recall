I need to update the `analyzeForMemories` function to include an `occurred_at` timestamp. The function analyzes messages and creates suggested memories. Each memory should have the timestamp from the message it came from.

Let me update:
1. The return type of `analyzeForMemories` to include `occurred_at`
2. Pass the message timestamp when creating memories

Then I need to update the stop.ts to pass the occurred_at when calling createMemory.
