Haiku works! The response shows that:
1. The model used was `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`
2. It returned valid memories with correct structure
3. It wrapped the JSON in markdown code blocks (which the existing code already handles via `stripMarkdownCodeBlocks`)

The test was successful - Haiku produced valid memory extraction output. Now I should update the memory extractor to use Haiku instead of the default model. I need to add `--model haiku` to the args in the `callClaudeCLI` method.

Let me make that change.
