The hook is working correctly now. It:
1. Extracted keywords from the prompt ("sausages", "stew")
2. Searched for matching memories
3. Found the memory we just created
4. Output it in a format that will be added to Claude's context

Now let me update the todo list and move on to updating the documentation.
