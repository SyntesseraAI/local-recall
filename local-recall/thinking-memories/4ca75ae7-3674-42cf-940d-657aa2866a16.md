Now I have a clear picture. The memories are created by the **Stop hook**, which:
1. Is triggered when Claude stops processing
2. Reads the transcript file from `transcript_path`
3. Parses the transcript for memory-worthy content
4. Creates memories based on assistant messages

The key issue for VS Code extension is likely that **the Stop hook may not be triggered or may not receive the proper input** in the VS Code extension environment.

Let me check if there's a log file that might have more information, and also think about what could be different in VS Code:

1. **Stop hook not triggered**: The VS Code extension might not support the `Stop` hook event
2. **Different transcript format**: The transcript file format might differ in VS Code
3. **Missing transcript_path**: The hook input might not include the transcript path
4. **Permission/sandbox issues**: The VS Code extension might have different filesystem access

Let me check the logger to see if there are any logs.
