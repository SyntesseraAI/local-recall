Interesting - the test shows the folder exists, but the MCP server is still not finding it. Looking at the log, I see:

```
[2025-11-30T14:45:15.080Z] [WARN] [transcript] Could not find matching Claude project directory
```

This is coming from the MCP server. The issue is that the MCP server might be using a different `projectPath` than the current working directory. Let me check how the MCP server configures the TranscriptCollector.

Let me look at the MCP server code to see how it sets up the TranscriptCollector.
