The user is reporting that the thinking prompt hook failed with an error:
```
libc++abi: terminating due to uncaught exception of type std::__1::system_error: mutex lock failed: Invalid argument
```

This looks like a C++ level error related to mutex locking, likely in the native modules (probably sqlite-vec or better-sqlite3). This could be happening in the thinking vector store initialization.

Let me look at the user-prompt-submit-thinking.ts hook to understand what it's doing and where this mutex error might be coming from.
