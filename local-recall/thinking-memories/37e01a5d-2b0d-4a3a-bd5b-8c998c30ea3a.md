Now I can add tests for the rate limit parsing. I need to export the rate limit parsing function or test it indirectly. Let me add tests by exporting the helper functions or creating a separate test file for rate limit parsing.

Actually, I can add a test that imports `RateLimitError` and tests the pattern matching by creating a wrapper that exposes the parsing. But since the parsing functions are private, I'll create a simpler approach - test the public behavior by checking that `RateLimitError` is thrown with correct reset time.

For now, let me add tests at the end of the existing test file that test the rate limit detection patterns. I'll export the parsing functions or add integration-style tests.

Actually, since `parseRateLimitResetTime` and `checkForRateLimit` are module-level functions (not class methods), I can export them for testing. Let me update the memory-extractor.ts to export these functions and then add tests.
