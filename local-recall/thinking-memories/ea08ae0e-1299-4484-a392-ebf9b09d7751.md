I can see the contents of the types.ts file. Looking through it, I see standard JSDoc-style comments (the /** ... */ blocks) that document the various types and interfaces. These are regular TypeScript comments, not specifically GitHub Copilot comments.

There are no visible GitHub Copilot-specific comments in this file. The comments are just standard documentation comments that any developer or tool would write.

I should answer the user's question directly - I can see comments in the file, but they appear to be standard JSDoc comments, not GitHub Copilot-specific comments.
