Now I need to:
1. Update the memoryFrontmatterSchema to include `occurred_at` and `content_hash`, and remove `updated_at`
2. Remove the `updateMemoryInputSchema` since we're removing update functionality
3. Update `MemoryIndexEntry` to use `occurred_at` instead of `updated_at`
4. Remove `timeWindow` from config since we won't need it anymore

Let me make these changes.
