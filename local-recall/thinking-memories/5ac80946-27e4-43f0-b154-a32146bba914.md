The user is asking about which model the extractor is using. Let me check the memory-extractor.ts file to see what model is being used for the memory extraction.

Looking at my earlier edit, I can see the callClaudeCLI method uses `'--model', 'haiku'`. The user wants the extractor to NOT use Haiku - only the keyword logic should use Haiku.

Let me check what the keyword logic is - that's probably in the user-prompt-submit hook.
