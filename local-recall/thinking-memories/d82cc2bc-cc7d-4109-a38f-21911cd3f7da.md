AH! This is very interesting! Looking at the logs, I can see:

1. **The hooks ARE firing in the VS Code extension!** The logs show:
   - SessionStart hooks ARE firing (lines 55-56, 81-82, 106)
   - UserPromptSubmit hook FIRED at line 14 (from the previous session)
   - Stop hook FIRED at line 29 (from the previous session)
   - The current session shows SessionStart hook fired at line 106 for session `fec79fbd-8b03-419e-ad28-5f3cddb1bbf3`

2. **BUT** - I notice that:
   - Line 72-74 says "Found 8 relevant memories for session"
   - Line 115 says "Found 8 relevant memories for session"
   - BUT I didn't see any of those memories when my session started!

So the hooks ARE working - they're firing and finding memories, but those memories are NOT being injected into my context! That's the real issue.

Let me check if there's something about how the SessionStart hook is supposed to output memories to my context.
