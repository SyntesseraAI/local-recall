The user wants to understand the vector approach used in this project. I have some context from the system reminders about the vector store, and I can see from CLAUDE.md that this is a memory system for AI coding assistants. Let me explain based on what I know, but I should also look at the actual implementation to give accurate details.

Let me read the key files to understand:
1. The vector store implementation
2. When embeddings are created
3. When search happens

From the context I already have:
- Uses SQLite with sqlite-vec extension
- Uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model
- Cosine distance similarity (0.0-1.0)
- Recency tie-breaker

But I should read the actual code to be precise about what gets embedded and when.
