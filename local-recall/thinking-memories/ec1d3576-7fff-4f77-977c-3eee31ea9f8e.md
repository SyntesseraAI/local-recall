Perfect! Looking at the code in user-prompt-submit.ts, I can see that:

1. Lines 126-134 show the hook IS outputting JSON in the correct format:
```typescript
const output = {
  hookSpecificOutput: {
    hookEventName: 'UserPromptSubmit',
    additionalContext,
  },
};

console.log(JSON.stringify(output));
```

2. The logs show:
   - SessionStart hooks are firing and working successfully
   - However, I notice there are NO UserPromptSubmit hook entries in the logs
   - This means the UserPromptSubmit hook is either not configured or not firing

Let me confirm whether the UserPromptSubmit hook is actually configured and running.
