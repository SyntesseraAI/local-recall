Now I understand the issues better. Let me analyze:

1. **E2BIG error** - The prompt includes the entire transcript content inline at line 118. When transcripts are large, this exceeds the OS limit for command-line argument length (~262144 bytes on macOS). The `claude -p prompt` approach passes the prompt as a command-line argument, not via stdin.

2. **Empty objects being returned** - Looking at the log:
   ```
   "memories": [
     {},
     {},
     {},
     {}
   ]
   ```
   The normalization code at lines 180-186 is mapping fields, but if Claude's response doesn't have any of the expected field names (subject/title/name/summary, etc.), all values become undefined, resulting in empty objects.

3. **Raw response parsing issue** - The "Raw response was:" log shows a full session structure with system messages. This suggests Claude CLI's `--output-format json` returns more than just the text response - it returns the full conversation structure.

Looking at the raw response:
```
[{"type":"system","subtype":"hook_response",...},{"type":"system","subtype":"init",...},{"type":"assistant","message":{...,"content":[{"type":"text","text":"```json\n{\n  \"memories\": []\n}\n```"}],...}]
```

So the Claude CLI output is an array of messages. The extractor needs to:
1. Find the assistant message in the array
2. Extract the text content from the assistant message
3. Parse the JSON (which is wrapped in markdown code blocks)

Let me trace through what's happening:
1. The response from Claude CLI is a JSON array
2. `parseClaudeResponse` does `JSON.parse(response)` which gives an array
3. The code checks `if (parsed.result)` - array doesn't have a result property
4. Then `if (typeof parsed === 'string')` - it's not a string


5. Then `if (Array.isArray(parsed))` - TRUE! So it wraps it in `{ memories: parsed }`

I see the critical error now. The code incorrectly interprets the entire message array as an array of memories. This fundamentally misunderstands the Claude CLI's JSON output structure. The parsing logic needs a complete overhaul to correctly extract the actual JSON-encoded response from within the assistant message's text content.

The core problems require two key fixes:
1. Use stdin for large transcript inputs
2. Implement a robust parsing mechanism that:
   - Identifies the assistant message
   - Extracts the markdown-encoded JSON
   - Properly parses the actual memories content

The raw response reveals a nested JSON structure with multiple message types, where the critical data lives inside a deeply nested text field.
