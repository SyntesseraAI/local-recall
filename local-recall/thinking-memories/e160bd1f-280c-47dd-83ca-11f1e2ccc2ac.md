Good - the MemoryManager does add to the vector store when creating memories. So the integration tests should work with some adjustments. The tests don't need to call `indexManager.buildIndex()` anymore - the memory manager already handles adding to the vector store.

Let me update the integration test file. The main changes:
1. Remove IndexManager import
2. Remove indexManager variable
3. Use SearchEngine with just memoryManager (or no args)
4. Remove all indexManager.buildIndex() and indexManager.refreshIndex() calls
5. Use VectorStore for explicit syncing if needed

Let me rewrite the test file:
