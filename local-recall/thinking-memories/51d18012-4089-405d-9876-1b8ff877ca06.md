The user is saying we can use timestamps for deduplication. So if we try to create the same memory twice, we check if one with that timestamp already exists.

This makes sense if the timestamp is based on when the conversation/event happened (from the transcript), not when the memory creation is attempted. So each memory would have a timestamp from the source event, and if we try to create a memory for the same event twice, we detect it via timestamp.

But timestamp alone might not be enough - two different memories could happen at the same second. We'd probably need timestamp + some other identifier (like content hash, or subject).

Let me clarify with them how they're thinking about this.
