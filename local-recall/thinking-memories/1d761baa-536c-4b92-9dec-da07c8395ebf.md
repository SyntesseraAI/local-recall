Now I understand the memory-extractor.ts. For thinking memories, I need a simpler approach:
1. No Claude CLI call needed - thinking blocks are used directly as content
2. Parse the transcript to extract thinking blocks
3. Generate a subject from the content
4. Process 20 files in parallel

I also need to look at how transcripts are parsed to get thinking blocks. Let me also check the transcript-collector.ts for reference.
