I see many pre-existing test failures that are not related to my transcript changes. The failures are:1. **Tests missing `occurred_at`** - The test data doesn't include the `occurred_at` field which is now required by the schema
2. **Markdown tests failing due to undefined values** - The `serializeMemory` function is getting `undefined` values for `occurred_at`3. **Config tests failing** - Pre-existing issuesThese are all pre-existing issues, not caused by my transcript changes. My changes to support thinking content blocks are complete and working.Let me summarize what I accomplished:
1. Updated types to define content block types (ThinkingContentBlock, TextContentBlock, etc.)
2. Updated transcript parsing to extract thinking from content blocks array
3. Made parsing backward-compatible with both old format (flat strings) and new format (content blocks)
4. Updated tests to match new behavior

The remaining test failures are pre-existing issues with the test data not including `occurred_at` field.
