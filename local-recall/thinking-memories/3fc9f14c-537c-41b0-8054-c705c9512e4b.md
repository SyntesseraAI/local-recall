The user wants to handle the case where Claude CLI returns a rate limit message like "5-hour limit reached - resets [time]". Instead of marking the transcript as processed, we should:

1. Detect this rate limit message in the response
2. Pause memory processing until the reset time + 5 minutes
3. Not mark the transcript as processed
