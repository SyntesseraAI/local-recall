Looking at the log file, I can see:

1. `SessionStart` hook fired successfully
2. `UserPromptSubmit` hook fired successfully
3. **No `Stop` hook has been fired**

This is the current session running in the CLI (not VS Code). The log shows this is a CLI session.

The key issue is clear now: **The Stop hook is never firing.** This could be because:

1. The VS Code extension doesn't support the `Stop` hook event at all
2. The `Stop` hook is only triggered in specific circumstances (like when using certain stop conditions)

Let me search for documentation or check if there's any issue with how the Stop hook is triggered in Claude Code.

Actually, looking at the CLAUDE.md documentation and the hook configuration, the `Stop` hook:
> "Triggered when Claude stops processing"

The issue is likely that **the VS Code extension may not trigger the Stop hook** - or it triggers differently than the CLI.

Let me also check what conditions trigger the Stop hook and if the transcript is properly being written.
