Perfect! Looking at line 29-50 of the log, I can see:

```
[2025-11-29T23:53:53.782Z] [INFO] [hooks] Stop hook fired
[2025-11-29T23:53:53.785Z] [INFO] [hooks] Stop hook input received: {

}
[2025-11-29T23:53:53.789Z] [INFO] [hooks] Stop hook: Found 9 potential memories
[2025-11-29T23:53:53.792Z] [INFO] [memory] Created memory e4bfc963-c6a1-45be-a8c2-1128f9ab456b: "The user is asking why memories are not being created..."
...
[2025-11-29T23:53:53.805Z] [INFO] [hooks] Stop hook completed: Created 9 new memories
```

So YES! The Stop hook IS working now! It fired after the previous conversation and created 9 memories. This is great!

The user is right - it seems like it IS working now. Those loaded memories at the start of this session were created by the Stop hook firing at the end of the previous session.

So the system is now fully functional:
- ✅ SessionStart hook works
- ✅ UserPromptSubmit hook works
- ✅ Stop hook works (creating memories)
- ✅ MCP server works

Everything is working! The user was right to correct me. Now the question is "what now?" - meaning what should we do next with this working system?
