The user is asking about "sausages" in the context of this local-recall memory system project. This seems like a non-sequitur or joke question - sausages (the food) have nothing to do with a memory indexing system for AI coding assistants.

I should respond in a friendly but brief way, acknowledging the humor while gently redirecting if they have actual questions about the project.
