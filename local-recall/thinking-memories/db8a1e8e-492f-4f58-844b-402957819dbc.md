The user is proposing a significant design change:

1. **Process the whole transcript history** - No time window filtering
2. **Idempotent memory creation** - Same content/context should result in the same memory (or be recognized as duplicate)
3. **Timestamped memories** - For episodic framing
4. **Immutable memories** - No update/delete via the system, only manual user removal

This is a philosophical shift from "mutable knowledge base" to "episodic memory log" - more like how human memory actually works. Events are recorded, not overwritten.

This raises some questions I should discuss with them:

1. **Idempotency mechanism** - How do we determine "same memory"?
   - Hash of content?
   - Subject + keywords match?
   - Semantic similarity?

2. **What happens to the update/delete MCP tools?** - Remove them? Make them user-only?

3. **Deduplication strategy** - If we process the whole transcript every time, we need to not create duplicates. Options:
   - Content hash stored in the memory
   - Check existing memories before creating
   - Use deterministic IDs based on content

4. **Episodic vs semantic** - Are we keeping both types? Or shifting to purely episodic?

Let me engage with them on these decisions.
