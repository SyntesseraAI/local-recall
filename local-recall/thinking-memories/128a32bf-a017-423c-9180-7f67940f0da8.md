Looking at the session-start hook, I can see that it:
1. Initializes the vector store (which downloads a 133MB embedding model on first use)
2. Syncs with all memories
3. Searches for relevant memories

The issue is likely the vector store initialization - downloading the embedding model is taking too long and exceeding the hook timeout. The CLAUDE.md mentions that first run can take 30-60 seconds while the model downloads.

Let me check the hooks configuration and also see what the timeout is. The hooks.json doesn't exist, so let me check the .claude-plugin directory.

For the gitignore issue, I need to add `memory.sqlite` to the gitignore file.

Let me also check if there's a vector-store.ts to understand what's happening there.
