Good, now let me also update the user-prompt-submit.ts to display the percentage with the right formatting (it should still show as percentage, just cleaner now). Let me check how it currently displays.Looking at user-prompt-submit.ts line 90:
```typescript
contextParts.push(`*Similarity: ${(result.score * 100).toFixed(0)}%*`);
```

This is fine since we're now rounding to 2 decimal places at the source, and then converting to percentage for display. With `score = 0.65`, this would show "Similarity: 65%".

Actually wait - the current code uses `toFixed(0)` which means no decimals in the percentage. If the score is 0.65, it shows 65%. But now that we're rounding at the source, the score could be 0.65 exactly, and 0.65 * 100 = 65, so toFixed(0) would show 65%.

Let me mark the todos as completed and build to verify no issues.
