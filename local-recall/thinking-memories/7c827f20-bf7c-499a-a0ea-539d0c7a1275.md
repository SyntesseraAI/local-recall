So the actual structure is different from what's documented:- The `scripts/` folder mentioned in docs doesn't exist. Instead, the build output goes to `dist/`- There's no `.claude-plugin/` folder- There's no `hooks.json` or `.mcp.json` at the root

Based on my analysis, the documentation has several inaccuracies. Let me provide a summary.
