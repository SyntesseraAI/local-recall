Now I understand the logic. The stop hook:

1. Reads the transcript file
2. Parses each line as JSONL
3. Only includes messages within `config.hooks.timeWindow` seconds of "now"
4. If no messages are within that window, it exits with "No recent messages to analyze"

The issue is likely that `timeWindowMs` is too narrow, or the timestamps in the transcript don't match up well. Let me check the config to see what the default timeWindow is.
