The Stop hook IS firing successfully in VS Code. Verified through recall.log which shows Stop hook firing and creating memories from conversations. All three hooks are functional: SessionStart loads memories, UserPromptSubmit searches and injects memories, and Stop hook creates new memories from transcripts.
