Local Recall can be installed as either: (1) npm package in node_modules with hooks/MCP configured to reference ./node_modules/local-recall/scripts/, or (2) cloned directory used as plugin root with hooks/MCP configured to reference ./scripts/. Plugin root contains .claude-plugin/plugin.json, hooks.json, and .mcp.json. The ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} variable is used in hook commands to reference scripts relative to plugin installation path.
