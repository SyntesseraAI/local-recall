# Memory Extraction from Transcripts

## Processing Method

The `memory-extractor.ts` module uses Claude's API to analyze condensed transcripts and extract valuable memories. This is not a simple pattern matching or regex operation.

## Implementation Details

- Uses the Claude API (via `@anthropic-ai/sdk`) to process transcripts
- Requires API key and token budget considerations
- Extracts memories following the guidelines in this memory extraction system
- Creates properly formatted memory markdown files with YAML frontmatter

## Cost and Performance Considerations

- Each transcript processing consumes API tokens
- The background daemon runs every 5 minutes, so multiple small API calls accumulate
- Memory extraction is asynchronous to avoid blocking user sessions
- The system should batch process multiple transcripts to optimize API usage

## Scope

Memory extraction follows the guidelines specified in this system's memory extraction format:
- Should extract architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, and discovered knowledge
- Should not extract generic programming knowledge or trivial information
- Memories should be actionable and help future sessions work more efficiently
