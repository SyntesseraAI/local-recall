The local-recall/.gitignore file itself must be tracked in git (it was previously deleted and needed to be restored). This file excludes:
- orama-*-index.json (generated vector indexes)
- recall.log (debug logs)
- *.jsonl.lock (JSONL lock files)

The .gitignore is created by MemoryManager.ensureGitignore() and should always exist in the repository.
