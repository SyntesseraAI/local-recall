The memory extraction process in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku to intelligently parse session transcripts and extract meaningful memories. The `extractMemoriesFromTranscript()` function takes a transcript path and calls Claude to identify valuable information based on a custom prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This enables automated, AI-powered memory creation from session activity rather than manual memory entry.
