The thinking memory minimum similarity threshold is configured using decimal notation (0.0 to 1.0) where 0.8 = 80% similarity.

Configuration:
- `LOCAL_RECALL_THINKING_MIN_SIMILARITY` (env var, default: 0.8)
- Used in search filtering to only include memories above the threshold
- Different from episodic memories which may use different notation
- Stored as a number in the config schema, not a percentage string
