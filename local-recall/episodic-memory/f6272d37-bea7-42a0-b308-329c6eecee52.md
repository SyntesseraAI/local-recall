The default minimum similarity threshold for thinking memory retrieval is 0.8 (80%), higher than the episodic memory default of 0.5 (50%). This is a deliberate choice to ensure only highly relevant thinking examples are injected, as thinking memories are more specific to decision-making patterns than general episodic facts.

**Configurable via:**
- Environment variable: `LOCAL_RECALL_THINKING_MIN_SIMILARITY`
- Config file property: `thinkingMinSimilarity`
