The memory extraction process condenses transcripts into a compressed format before analyzing them for memory creation. This includes:

**Condensed format uses markers:**
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses  
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool calls

**Benefits:**
- Reduces token usage when sending to Claude for analysis
- Focuses extraction on meaningful events
- Improves clarity of what happened during the session

**Implementation location:** Transcript condensing logic in memory-extractor.ts handles the compression.
