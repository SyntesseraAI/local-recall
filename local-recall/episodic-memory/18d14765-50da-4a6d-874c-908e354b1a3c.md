The transcript condensing and memory extraction system works with a specific event-based format:
- `[User]` - User requests and questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool invocations

This structured format makes it easier for Claude to analyze sessions and extract meaningful memories about what was learned, solved, or decided.
