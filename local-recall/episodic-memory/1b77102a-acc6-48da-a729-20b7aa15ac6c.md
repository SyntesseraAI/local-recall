The memory extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` instructs Claude on how to analyze transcripts and extract memories. Key aspects:

- Prompt provides context about the project and memory file format
- Specifies the YAML frontmatter structure required for memory files
- Guides the extraction of memories from session transcripts
- Returns JSON array of extracted memories with required fields (subject, keywords, applies_to, content)
- Emphasizes creating atomic, actionable memories specific to the codebase
