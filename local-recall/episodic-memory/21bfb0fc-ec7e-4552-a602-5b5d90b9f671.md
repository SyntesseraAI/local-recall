Claude Code stores session transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` with a specific naming convention:

- Project directories use URL-encoded paths with dashes replacing slashes
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files within session directories
- The transcript collector in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` reads these files to extract memory content
