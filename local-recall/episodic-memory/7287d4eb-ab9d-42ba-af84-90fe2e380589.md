Currently, memories are not compacted or automatically cleaned up. While a `maxMemories` configuration option exists in `src/utils/config.ts` (default: 1000), there is no logic in place to enforce this limit or to consolidate/merge similar memories. Memories grow indefinitely unless manually deleted. This could be a future optimization area if memory count or storage becomes a concern.
