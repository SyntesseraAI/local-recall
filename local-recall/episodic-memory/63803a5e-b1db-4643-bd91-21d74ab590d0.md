The memory extractor in memory-extractor.ts handles transcript analysis and memory creation. It processes Claude Code session transcripts to extract valuable information and create episodic memories. The module works with condensed transcript formats containing [User], [Assistant], [Tool], and [Result] events. The extraction is driven by prompts defined in memory-extraction.ts which guide the memory creation process.
