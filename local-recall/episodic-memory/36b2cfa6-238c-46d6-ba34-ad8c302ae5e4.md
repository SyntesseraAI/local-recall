The transcript condensing system filters out noise from raw transcripts by detecting meaningful state changes. It compares consecutive transcript entries (typically messages and tool invocations) and only includes entries where the content differs from the previous entry.

This approach:
- Reduces transcript size while preserving semantic content
- Removes duplicate logging or repeated information
- Uses simple string comparison for efficiency
- Maintains chronological order of events
- Helps Claude extract more focused memories from cleaner data
