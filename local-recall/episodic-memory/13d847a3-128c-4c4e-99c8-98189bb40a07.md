The local-recall system extracts memories from Claude Code session transcripts to capture knowledge that will help future AI assistants. Transcript format uses events like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]`. This systematic analysis helps identify learned patterns, solved problems, and codebase-specific knowledge worth preserving across sessions.
