Memory extraction follows strict guidelines:
- Extract specific, actionable information with file paths and function names
- Avoid generic programming knowledge
- Skip temporary debugging steps
- Exclude sensitive data
- Focus on architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and user preferences
- Use appropriate scope (global, file:path, area:name)
- Memories should help future assistants work more efficiently
