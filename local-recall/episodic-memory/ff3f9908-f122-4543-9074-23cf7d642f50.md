The `ensureGitignore()` method in IndexManager was updated to create the base `local-recall` directory if it doesn't exist before attempting to write the `.gitignore` file. This makes the initialization more robust for fresh projects where the local-recall folder hasn't been created yet. The directory creation is synchronous using `fs.mkdirSync()` with the `{ recursive: true }` option to avoid errors if the directory already exists.
