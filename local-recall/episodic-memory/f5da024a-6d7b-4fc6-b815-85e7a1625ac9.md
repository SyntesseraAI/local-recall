The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) with streaming to analyze transcripts and extract memories. The extraction includes:

- Reads transcript content from provided paths
- Uses a structured prompt (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) to guide memory extraction
- Parses Claude's streaming response to extract JSON-formatted memories
- Creates memories using the standard memory creation pipeline
- Handles errors gracefully with logging

This allows for intelligent, context-aware memory creation from session transcripts without requiring manual intervention.
