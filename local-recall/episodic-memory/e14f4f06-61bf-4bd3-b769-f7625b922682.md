# Memory Extraction Process

The MCP server daemon processes Claude Code transcripts to extract memories using the Claude API itself.

## Implementation Details

- Uses `claude -p --model haiku` to extract keywords and memories from transcript content
- The Claude API (`claude -p`) is invoked to analyze transcript messages and generate keyword summaries
- This approach leverages Claude's language understanding to intelligently identify what's important

## Benefits

- More intelligent than simple keyword extraction
- Understands context and relevance
- Can identify implicit patterns and relationships
- Scalable approach that doesn't require hardcoded rules

## Location

- User-prompt-submit hook also uses this approach in `src/hooks/user-prompt-submit.ts`
- MCP server background daemon in daemon mode

## Important Note

This is a key component of how memories are created from transcripts, so the Claude API integration must remain working and available.
