# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The transcript-collector needs to condense full JSONL transcripts into a more compact format for AI analysis and memory extraction.

## Current State

Transcripts from Claude Code contain full conversation history with messages and tool calls. Before passing to Claude for memory extraction, these should be condensed to:
- Extract key events (user requests, assistant responses, tool calls)
- Remove verbose/repetitive content
- Maintain essential context
- Create a summary format suitable for analysis

This feature is being implemented in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` to improve the efficiency of memory extraction from transcripts.
