Hooks are configured in hooks.json as shell commands receiving JSON via stdin. SessionStart loads 5 most recent memories without vector store. UserPromptSubmit does semantic search with vector embeddings. Stop hook is currently disabled - memory extraction is handled by MCP server daemon processing transcripts every 5 minutes asynchronously.
