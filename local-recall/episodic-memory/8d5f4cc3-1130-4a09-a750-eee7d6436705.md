The memory extraction prompt logic is separated into `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` rather than being hardcoded in the extractor. This allows for easier refinement and testing of the prompt instructions without modifying the core extraction logic. The prompt provides detailed guidelines on what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks) and what NOT to extract (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data).
