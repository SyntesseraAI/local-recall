Local Recall uses `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. Model is cached in `local_cache/` directory. First run downloads the model (30-60 seconds), subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file is missing, delete the corrupted cache directory to trigger re-download: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*`
