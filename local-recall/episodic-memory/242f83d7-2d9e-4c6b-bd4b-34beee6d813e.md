Local Recall is a project that enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. It creates a persistent memory layer stored locally within the repository, making memories version-controllable and shareable among team members. The system includes a vector-store for semantic search, MCP server integration, and Claude Code hooks for automatic memory management.
