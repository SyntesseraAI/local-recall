The memory extraction process in memory-extractor.ts uses Claude Haiku model with streaming enabled for token efficiency. The implementation tracks token usage (input_tokens, output_tokens) from streaming response metadata to monitor extraction efficiency and prevent excessive token consumption during batch memory creation from transcripts.
