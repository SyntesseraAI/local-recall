The MemoryExtractor class in src/core/memory-extractor.ts uses the Anthropic Claude API to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. It sends condensed transcript events to Claude with a structured prompt that guides memory extraction. The extractor uses `anthropic.messages.create()` with the `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` model and processes the response to create Memory objects with proper metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash).
