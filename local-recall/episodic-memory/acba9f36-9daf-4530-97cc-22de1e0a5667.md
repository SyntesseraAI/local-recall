The `local-recall/index.json` file is gitignored and auto-generated by the `buildIndex()` function. However, for search functionality to work in hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit), the index must exist on disk. The build process should ensure the index is created as part of the bundled output so hooks can access it immediately without waiting for a rebuild.
