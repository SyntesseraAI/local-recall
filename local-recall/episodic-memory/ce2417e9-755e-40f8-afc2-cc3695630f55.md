The maximum concurrent transcript processors was reduced from 20 to 5. This is configured at line 148 in `memory-extractor.ts` in the `MAX_CONCURRENT_PROCESSORS` constant (or as part of the concurrency configuration in the extractor initialization). This change reduces system load during transcript processing, which is important for machines with limited resources or when processing large batches of transcripts.
