# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Naming Convention

The project folder name is derived from the absolute work directory path:
- Spaces are converted to hyphens
- Forward slashes are converted to hyphens
- The path `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the project folder:
`~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

Each line in the JSONL file is a JSON object representing a single transcript event with timestamp and content.
