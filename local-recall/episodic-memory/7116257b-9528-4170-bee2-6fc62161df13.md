The memory extraction prompt is stored in a separate file (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) rather than hardcoded in the extractor. This allows:

1. Easy iteration on the extraction prompt without touching core logic
2. Better testing of different prompt variations
3. Clear separation between prompt engineering and extraction logic
4. Easier maintenance and version control of prompt changes
