Local Recall is a structured memory management system that enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions. It stores memories as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings (BGE-small-en-v1.5 model via fastembed) for semantic search. Memories can be scoped as `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<component-name>`. The project includes an MCP server for tool exposure and Claude Code hooks for SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, and Stop events.
