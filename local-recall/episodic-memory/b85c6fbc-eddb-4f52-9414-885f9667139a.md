# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes and colons replaced by underscores.

**Example:** 
- Project path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) in the project folder:
- Multiple files for different sessions
- Each line is a complete JSON object representing a single event/message
- Files are named with timestamps or session identifiers

## Implementation Note

This is relevant for `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` which needs to:
1. Convert the project path to the folder name format (replace `/` with `-`, `:` with `_`)
2. Look for transcript files in `~/.claude/projects/<converted-path>/`
3. Parse `.jsonl` files to extract session information
