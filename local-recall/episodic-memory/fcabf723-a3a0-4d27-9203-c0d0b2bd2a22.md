Memory scope determines where the information is most relevant:
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to component/area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

Choosing the correct scope ensures memories are surfaced to the right context when needed, improving assistant efficiency.
