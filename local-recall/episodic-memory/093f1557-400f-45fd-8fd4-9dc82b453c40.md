The memory extraction process focuses on identifying four key types of information from session transcripts: (1) What was learned, (2) Important facts about the codebase, (3) Code patterns specific to the project, and (4) Problems that were solved. This structured approach ensures memories capture actionable insights that will help future assistants work more efficiently on the codebase.
