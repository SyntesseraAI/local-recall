The memory extraction prompt contains detailed guidelines for how Claude should analyze transcripts and extract memories. It emphasizes being specific (file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable. The prompt also defines what should and shouldn't be extracted (architecture decisions yes, generic programming knowledge no).
