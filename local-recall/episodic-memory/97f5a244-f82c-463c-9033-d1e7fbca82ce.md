The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku model to extract keywords from transcript text. This is done via the `claude -p` CLI interface with a structured prompt that instructs the model to identify relevant keywords from conversation content. The extracted keywords are then used to search for relevant memories and determine if new memories should be created.
