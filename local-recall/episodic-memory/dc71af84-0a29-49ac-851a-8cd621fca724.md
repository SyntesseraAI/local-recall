The memory extraction process converts full transcripts into a condensed format with events:
- `[User]` - user requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses
- `[Tool: Name]` - tool invocations with parameters
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - outcomes

This condensed format is more efficient for analysis and memory creation. The memory-extractor.ts file handles this conversion process.
