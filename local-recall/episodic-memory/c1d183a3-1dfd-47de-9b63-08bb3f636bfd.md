# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory:
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`
- Format: JSONL (JSON Lines) - one JSON object per line
- Each line contains a transcript entry with timestamp and content

## Accessing Transcripts

When implementing transcript collection (like in the MCP daemon), you can:
1. Construct the project folder name by replacing slashes with dashes in the working directory
2. Read JSONL files from `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`
3. Parse each line as a JSON object to extract transcript data

This is useful for memory extraction and processing transcripts asynchronously.
