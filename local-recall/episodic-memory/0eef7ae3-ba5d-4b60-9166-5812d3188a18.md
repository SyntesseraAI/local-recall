Memory markdown files in local-recall/episodic-memory/ ARE version-controlled and committed to git, making them shareable among team members. The SQLite database (memory.sqlite) and embedding cache (local_cache/) are gitignored and auto-generated. This design allows memories to be preserved and tracked as project documentation evolves.
