The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku (via `claude -p`) to extract memories from transcripts. It sends a structured prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to the model, which returns memories in JSON format. The extractor handles parsing, validation, and deduplication of extracted memories before storing them.
