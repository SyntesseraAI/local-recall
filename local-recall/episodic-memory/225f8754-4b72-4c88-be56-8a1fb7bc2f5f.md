# Memory Extraction vs Memory Searching

## Searching (In-Context)

The UserPromptSubmit hook searches existing memories based on the user's prompt and injects them into Claude's context in real-time during the session.

## Extraction (Async)

The MCP server's background daemon processes complete session transcripts asynchronously (every 5 minutes) to extract NEW memories that should be persisted for future sessions.

These are two distinct processes:
- **Search**: Real-time, hook-based, finds and uses existing memories
- **Extraction**: Async, daemon-based, creates new memories from session learnings

The Stop hook (currently disabled) would have handled extraction at session end, but the async approach via MCP server is more reliable and doesn't block the user.
