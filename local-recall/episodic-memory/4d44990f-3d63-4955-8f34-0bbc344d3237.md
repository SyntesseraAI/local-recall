Initial testing of thinking memory context injection showed 5 thinking excerpts retrieved with 67% similarity scores. These included memories about:
- Searching for memories and listing all to find related content
- Updating memory_list response to show correct fields
- Improving logic for what content is "memory worthy"
- Checking memories when there don't seem to be any
- Searching functionality (truncated in transcript)

All excerpts had identical 67% similarity, suggesting either uniform relevance to the query or potential tuning needed for the similarity threshold. This indicates the thinking memory system is functional for capturing and retrieving reasoning patterns from previous sessions.
