# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Project path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line) with `.jsonl` extension. Each file represents a complete Claude Code session.

## Usefulness

Knowing this path structure is essential for the MCP server daemon which syncs transcripts from Claude's cache to process them for memory extraction.
