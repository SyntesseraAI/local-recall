## Problem

Hooks are executing without errors but returning empty stdout, which prevents memory content from being injected into Claude's context. This breaks the entire memory injection system for end users.

## Root Cause

The hooks are being called correctly by Claude Code, but:
1. They may not be outputting to stdout properly
2. The memory files may not exist or be readable
3. The hook logic may be silently failing without throwing errors

## Impact

Without proper stdout output, memories are not injected into Claude's context, making the memory system non-functional for users even though the underlying infrastructure works.

## Investigation Points

- Check that hook scripts properly output JSON or memory content to stdout
- Verify memory files are being created and stored correctly
- Ensure hooks have proper error handling and logging
- Test hooks in isolation to verify they output expected data
