Local Recall integrates with Claude Code via hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json`:

**SessionStart Hook**: Triggered when session begins, loads 5 most recent memories from disk (doesn't use vector store to avoid slow initialization)

**UserPromptSubmit Hook**: Triggered before Claude processes user prompt, performs semantic search using vector embeddings to find relevant memories

**Stop Hook**: Currently disabled - memory extraction is handled by MCP server daemon processing transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes
