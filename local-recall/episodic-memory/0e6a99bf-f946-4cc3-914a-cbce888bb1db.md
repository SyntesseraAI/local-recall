The memory extraction system expects transcripts condensed into standardized events:

- `[User]` - User questions or requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude responses or explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This structured format allows the memory-extractor to systematically analyze what was learned, what is now known, what is specific to the codebase, and what problems were solved.
