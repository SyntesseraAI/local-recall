The plugin's hooks.json uses ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} to resolve paths to bundled hook scripts. Hook commands point to:
- scripts/hooks/session-start.js
- scripts/hooks/user-prompt-submit.js
- scripts/hooks/stop.js

These are compiled versions of the TypeScript source hooks from src/hooks/. When updating hooks, both the source TypeScript and the plugin's configuration/compiled scripts must stay in sync. After modifying src/hooks/, run 'npm run build' to update the bundled plugin versions.
