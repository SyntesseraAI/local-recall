Claude stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` with directory names that are encoded versions of full file paths. For example, the path `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes a directory name like `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`. This encoding allows Claude to store multiple project transcripts without path conflicts.
