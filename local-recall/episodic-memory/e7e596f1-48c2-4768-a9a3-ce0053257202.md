A dedicated prompt file (memory-extraction.ts) contains the guidelines for memory extraction. The prompt guides Claude to identify and extract:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Component relationships and dependencies
- Performance considerations and optimizations

The prompt explicitly excludes generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and sensitive data.
