Three hooks are configured in hooks.json: SessionStart (loads 5 most recent memories on session begin), UserPromptSubmit (performs semantic search on user prompt), and Stop (processes transcripts asynchronously). SessionStart doesn't use vector store to avoid slow initialization every session. UserPromptSubmit initializes vector store lazily (cached after first use). Hooks are configured in .claude/settings.json as shell commands receiving JSON via stdin.
