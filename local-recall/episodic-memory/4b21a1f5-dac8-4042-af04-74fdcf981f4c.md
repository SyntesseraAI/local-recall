# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`
- Transcript files: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) files, where each line is a JSON object representing a transcript event.

## Relevance

This is critical for the transcript-collector component which needs to:
1. Locate Claude's transcript cache on the user's system
2. Parse the `.jsonl` format correctly
3. Construct the proper path using the project's absolute path
4. Monitor for new transcripts to process

## Implementation Note

The `transcript-collector.ts` file needs to handle this path construction and handle both macOS and potentially other operating systems differently.
