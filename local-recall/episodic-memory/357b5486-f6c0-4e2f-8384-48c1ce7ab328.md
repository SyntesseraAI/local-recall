The daemon architecture described in CLAUDE.md (hooks calling HTTP API to MCP daemon) solves the ONNX mutex problem but prevents running multiple Claude instances simultaneously, since they would all try to use the same daemon process. The user prefers an alternative that allows independent Claude instances without a shared daemon.
