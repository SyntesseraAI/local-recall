The `MemoryExtractor` in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` processes condensed transcripts to extract valuable memories. The pipeline works by: 1) receiving condensed transcript content from TranscriptCondenser, 2) analyzing the semantic content to identify key memories, 3) structuring them with proper metadata (keywords, scope, timestamp). This separation of concerns allows transcripts to be condensed once and analyzed multiple times.
