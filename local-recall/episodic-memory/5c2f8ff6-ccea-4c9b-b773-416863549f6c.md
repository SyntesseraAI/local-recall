The memory extraction system converts Claude Code session transcripts into persistent memories that are stored as markdown files in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. This allows knowledge learned during sessions to be retained and searched in future sessions, enabling continuous improvement of the assistant's understanding of the codebase.
