Claude stores project data in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project folders use URL-encoded paths (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`) and contain JSONL transcript files with UUIDs as filenames. This is where Claude Code caches session transcripts that the MCP server reads for memory extraction.
