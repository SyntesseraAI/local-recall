The memory extraction system prioritizes extracting:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations and optimizations

These types of memories are most valuable for helping future assistants work efficiently on this specific codebase.
