The TranscriptCollector class manages transcript files from two sources:

1. **Source transcripts** - Located in Claude's project cache at `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
2. **Local transcripts** - Stored in the local-recall project folder

**Key methods:**
- `findClaudeProjectDir()` - Locates the Claude project directory by matching against the current working directory
- `listSourceTranscripts()` - Lists transcripts from Claude's cache (source of truth)
- `listLocalTranscripts()` - Lists transcripts already processed locally
- `copyTranscripts()` - Copies new transcripts from Claude's cache to local storage

Transcripts are JSONL format files. The collector identifies them by UUID filename pattern to distinguish real transcripts from other files in the directory.
