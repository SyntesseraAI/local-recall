Claude stores project directories in ~/.claude/projects/ using a naming convention where the full path has slashes replaced with dashes. For example, /Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall becomes -Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall. The transcript files are stored directly in this project directory, not in a subfolder. When discovering projects, prioritize this naming pattern first before falling back to other methods.
