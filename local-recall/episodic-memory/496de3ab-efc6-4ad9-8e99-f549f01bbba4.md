The MemoryExtractor class in memory-extractor.ts is responsible for: (1) filtering transcripts to find new or changed content, (2) invoking Claude Haiku to extract memories, (3) parsing the JSON response, (4) detecting duplicates using occurred_at timestamps and content_hash comparison, (5) creating only new memories via the memory manager. The extractor prevents duplicate memories by checking against existing memories before creation.
