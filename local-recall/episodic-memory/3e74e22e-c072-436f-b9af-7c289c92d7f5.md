The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to analyze session transcripts and extract meaningful memories. The extraction process is configured via prompts in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and processes transcripts to identify learnings, architectural decisions, bug fixes, and codebase-specific patterns.
