Recent commits implemented a refactor where memories follow an idempotent create-only pattern (no updates). The created_at field was removed and replaced with occurred_at for sorting and deduplication purposes. This allows memories to be safely recreated from transcripts without losing information, as duplicate detection uses the occurred_at timestamp and content_hash.
