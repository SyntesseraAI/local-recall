# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory within each project folder:
- Path: `~/.claude/projects/{project-folder}/transcripts/`
- Format: JSONL (JSON Lines - one JSON object per line)
- Each line represents a single transcript entry

## Important Notes

- The path transformation uses dashes for path separators, not underscores
- This path format is consistent across macOS
- Transcripts are automatically generated and stored by Claude Code during sessions
- This information is needed for transcript-based memory extraction and processing
