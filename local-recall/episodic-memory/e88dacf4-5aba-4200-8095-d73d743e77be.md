Memories in Local Recall are stored as individual markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. Each memory file contains:

- **Metadata fields**: id (UUID), subject (one-line description), keywords (array), applies_to (scope), occurred_at (ISO timestamp), content_hash (SHA-256 prefix)
- **Content**: Markdown formatted body with actual memory information

Memory files are version-controlled and tracked in git. The index (`local-recall/index.json`) is gitignored and auto-generated from these files.
