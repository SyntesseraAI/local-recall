The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku via the `claude -p` command to analyze transcripts and extract memories. It sends a structured prompt to Claude and receives JSON-formatted memories back. The prompt system is defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and handles the conversion of transcript content into standardized memory objects with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content fields.
