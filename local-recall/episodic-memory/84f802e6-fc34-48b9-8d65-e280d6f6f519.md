# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is created by taking the absolute working directory path and replacing forward slashes with dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/project` becomes `Users-joe-Code-project`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-project/transcripts/`
- Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format)

## Key Implementation Details

When collecting transcripts:
1. Get the current working directory
2. Replace all `/` characters with `-`
3. Append to `~/.claude/projects/`
4. Look for `.jsonl` files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory
5. Each line is a complete JSON object representing a transcript event

This format allows the system to track which project a transcript belongs to based on its filesystem location.
