# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS. The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes converted to hyphens.

## Example Path Format

For working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`

Transcripts are stored at: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) files with one JSON object per line, making them efficient to stream and parse incrementally.

## Relevance

This is important for the MCP server and transcript collection features in local-recall, as they need to locate and read Claude's transcript cache to extract memories.
