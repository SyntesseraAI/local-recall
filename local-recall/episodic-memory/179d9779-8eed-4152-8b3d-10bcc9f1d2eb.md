The memory-extractor.ts module is responsible for converting session transcripts into structured memories. It uses the Claude API (via Anthropic SDK) to analyze transcripts and generate memories with proper metadata. The extraction process involves:

1. Reading transcript files and parsing them
2. Calling Claude with a specialized prompt to extract memories
3. Parsing Claude's response to create Memory objects with proper frontmatter
4. Handling errors and invalid responses gracefully

This is a critical component in the Local Recall system for converting raw transcript data into usable memories that can be stored and searched.
