The transcript condensing feature groups transcript entries by `session_id` before passing to Claude for memory extraction. Each session's transcript is condensed separately to create focused, session-specific memories.

**Process:**
1. Read all transcript entries from the transcript file
2. Group entries by `session_id` field
3. For each session group, condense the entries into a summarized format
4. Pass the condensed session transcript to Claude for memory extraction
5. Extract and store memories from the condensed output

**Benefit:** This prevents memories from mixing data across different sessions and ensures each session's context is properly captured and isolated.
