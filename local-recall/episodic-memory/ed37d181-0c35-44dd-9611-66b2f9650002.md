The memory extraction prompt defines clear guidance:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions with reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Info that becomes outdated quickly

Memories should be specific (file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes).
