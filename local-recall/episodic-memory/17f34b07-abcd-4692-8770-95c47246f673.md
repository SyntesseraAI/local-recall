Claude stores projects in ~/.claude/projects with folder names using the full path with slashes replaced by dashes. Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`. The TranscriptCollector should prioritize this naming convention when searching for project folders, as it's more reliable than other fallback methods.
