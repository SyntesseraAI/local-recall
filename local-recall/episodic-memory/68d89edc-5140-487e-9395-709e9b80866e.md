The memory extraction system in memory-extractor.ts uses `claude -p` (streaming) mode to efficiently process transcripts and extract memories. This approach allows for real-time processing without buffering entire responses in memory. The extracted memories are then parsed from the JSON output and stored via the memory manager.
