**User's Code Philosophy:**

**DO:**
- Make only requested changes or clearly necessary ones
- Keep solutions simple and focused
- Follow YAGNI principle (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

**DON'T:**
- Add features beyond what was asked
- Refactor code or make 'improvements' that aren't required
- Add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to unchanged code
- Add error handling for scenarios that can't happen
- Create helpers/utilities/abstractions for one-time operations
- Design for hypothetical future requirements
- Remove backward compatibility hacks; delete unused code completely
- Leave empty markers like `// removed` comments

**Principle:** The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task. Three similar lines of code are better than a premature abstraction.
