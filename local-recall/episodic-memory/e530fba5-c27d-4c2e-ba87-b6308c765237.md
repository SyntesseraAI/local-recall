The transcript processing system was capturing its own `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` memory extraction requests, causing recursive processing. Need to filter out messages prefixed with `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` from transcript analysis to prevent the system from trying to extract memories from its own internal prompts.
