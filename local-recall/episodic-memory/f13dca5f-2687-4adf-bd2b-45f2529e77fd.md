Memory files in the local-recall/ directory structure are intentionally version-controlled in git:

1. **episodic-memory/*.md** - Individual memory files stored as markdown with YAML frontmatter
2. **thinking-memory/*.md** - Thinking memory files with thought+output pairs
3. **Why version-controlled**: Makes memories shareable among team members, auditable, and restorable
4. **Gitignored files**: Only the index files (orama-*-index.json) and recall.log are gitignored
5. **Unique IDs**: Each memory has a UUID to prevent duplicates via content_hash deduplication
6. **Occurred_at field**: ISO-8601 timestamps enable sorting and recency tie-breaking in search results

This is a deliberate design choice - memories are not temporary caches but persistent project knowledge.
