# Memory Extraction with claude -p

The local-recall MCP server uses `claude -p` (Claude prompt mode) to process transcripts and extract meaningful memories.

## How It Works

1. Transcripts are read from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
2. Content is passed through `claude -p` for analysis
3. Claude extracts key learnings and insights
4. Extracted content becomes memory files

## Key Benefit

Using `claude -p` allows the system to intelligently understand transcript context and extract only truly valuable memories, rather than blindly parsing text patterns.
