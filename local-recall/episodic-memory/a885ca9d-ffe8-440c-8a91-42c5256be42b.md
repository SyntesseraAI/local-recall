Memory extraction is a central feature of local-recall that converts Claude Code session transcripts into structured, reusable memories. This allows knowledge learned during one session to benefit future sessions. The extraction process uses Claude's API to intelligently identify valuable information from transcripts and format it according to the memory schema (subject, keywords, scope, content).
