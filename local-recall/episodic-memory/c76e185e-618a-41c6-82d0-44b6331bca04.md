Added `isSyntheticTranscript()` method to TranscriptCollector (line 317-331) that checks the first 10KB of a transcript for the `"<synthetic>"` marker. This method is called in both `thinking-extractor.ts:140-149` and `memory-extractor.ts:441-450` to skip synthetic files early before any processing occurs.

Synthetic files are generated by memory extraction tests and should never be included in thinking or episodic memory extraction. They pollute the memory database with false data.
