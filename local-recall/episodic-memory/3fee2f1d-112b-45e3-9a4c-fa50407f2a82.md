# Transcript Analysis for Memory Extraction

When extracting memories from Claude Code session transcripts, transcripts are condensed into events:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool execution outcomes

Memories should be extracted based on:
1. What was learned
2. What is now known
3. What is specific to the codebase
4. What problems were solved

Use appropriate scope (global, file:<path>, area:<name>) for each memory.
