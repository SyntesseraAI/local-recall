# Transcript File Format

Claude transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files where each line represents one event.

## Event Structure

Each event has:
- `event_type`: String indicating the type of event (e.g., "user", "assistant", "tool_call", etc.)
- Additional fields depending on the event type

## Common Event Types

- **user**: User message
  - Contains: message text
- **assistant**: Claude's response
  - Contains: response text
- **tool_call**: Tool invocation (Read, Edit, Bash, etc.)
  - Contains: tool name and parameters
- **tool_result**: Tool execution result
  - Contains: success/failure status and output

## Parsing Considerations

When reading JSONL files:
1. Split by newline to get individual records
2. Parse each line as valid JSON
3. Check `event_type` field to understand the event
4. Handle both successful and failed tool calls
