On session start, the system performs a **full reload** of memories, not a delta/incremental load. The SessionStart hook in `src/hooks/session-start.ts` creates a fresh MemoryManager instance and loads all memories from disk, then selects the 5 most recent ones (sorted by `occurred_at` descending) for injection into the session context.

This design is intentional - each session starts with a clean slate and loads the most recent memories, ensuring fresh context without carrying stale session state between sessions.
