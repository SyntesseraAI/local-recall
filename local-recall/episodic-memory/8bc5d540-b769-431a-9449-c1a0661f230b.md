Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS. The project folder name uses the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example, `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`. Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with one event per line, allowing for incremental reading and change detection.
