Vector store uses better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for semantic similarity search. Embeddings generated with fastembed using BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB, cached in local_cache/). Cosine distance scoring: 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (identical), rounded to 2 decimals. Results ranked by score descending, with recency tie-breaker when scores equal. Store syncs with file-based memories via add/remove operations.
