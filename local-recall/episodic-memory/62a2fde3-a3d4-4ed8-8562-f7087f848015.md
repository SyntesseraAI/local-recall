The memory extraction process in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku (`claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`) via the `@anthropic-sdk/sdk` to intelligently extract memories from transcripts. The extractor sends condensed transcripts with a structured prompt (defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) that asks Claude to identify valuable insights, architectural decisions, bug fixes, and code patterns. The response is parsed as JSON containing an array of memory objects with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content fields. This design allows for intelligent, context-aware memory extraction rather than simple regex-based parsing.
