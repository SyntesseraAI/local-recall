# Transcript Condensing Feature

The `transcript-collector.ts` module includes a transcript condensing feature designed to improve memory extraction efficiency.

## Purpose

Condenses verbose transcripts into concise, actionable content before passing to Claude Haiku for memory extraction. This reduces token usage and improves extraction quality by removing noise and repetition.

## Implementation

The condensing logic:
- Removes tool invocation details that aren't relevant to memory creation
- Summarizes repetitive patterns
- Preserves key decisions, learnings, and problem-solving steps
- Maintains chronological order of important events

## Integration

Used by the MCP server background daemon when processing transcripts to extract memories. Helps ensure extracted memories are focused and high-quality.
