Local Recall creates a persistent memory layer that allows multiple AI agents (Claude Code, MCP clients) to store and retrieve contextual information about the codebase. All memories are stored locally as markdown files within the repository, making them version-controllable and shareable among team members. Memories help AI assistants retain information and context across different sessions.
