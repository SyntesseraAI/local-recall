The memory extraction system works with condensed transcripts that use specific event markers:

- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses or explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool invocations

This condensed format is designed to be efficiently processed by Claude's API to extract meaningful memories from sessions. The extraction prompt in `memory-extraction.ts` is specifically designed for this format.
