# Memory Extraction Process

The local-recall system processes Claude Code session transcripts to extract actionable memories. The extraction focuses on:

1. Keywords extracted from user prompts and assistant responses
2. Specific discoveries about the codebase (architecture, patterns, conventions)
3. Bugs fixed and their root causes
4. Configuration quirks and gotchas
5. User preferences and project-specific patterns

Memories are scoped appropriately (global, file-specific, or area-specific) and include concrete details to be actionable for future sessions.
