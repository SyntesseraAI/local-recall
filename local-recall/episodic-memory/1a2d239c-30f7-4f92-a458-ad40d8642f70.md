Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Memories are stored locally in version-controlled files, allowing AI agents to share knowledge and maintain project-specific context. The system includes hooks for SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit events, plus an MCP server for memory tool access.
