Memory extraction logic uses custom prompts defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This file contains the template and instructions sent to Claude for extracting valuable memories from transcripts. Keeping prompts separate from the extraction logic allows for easy iteration and updates to extraction criteria without modifying the core extractor code.
