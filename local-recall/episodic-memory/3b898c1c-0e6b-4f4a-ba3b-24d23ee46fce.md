Local Recall is a local markdown-powered memory system that allows Claude Code and other AI tools (via MCP) to retain information and context across sessions. Memories are stored in version-controlled markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings for semantic search using fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB).
