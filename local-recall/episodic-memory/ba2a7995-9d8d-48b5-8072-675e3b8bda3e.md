# SQLite to Orama Migration

The project replaced native SQLite with sqlite-vec extension with Orama, a pure JavaScript vector search engine.

## Why This Change
- Orama has no native dependencies, eliminating mutex and process isolation issues
- Hooks can now directly use Orama without needing daemon communication
- Simplified architecture by removing HTTP server daemon pattern

## What Changed
- Removed `http-server.ts`, `daemon-client.ts`, and `database.ts` (daemon architecture)
- Hooks now work directly with vector search instead of communicating with a background daemon
- Vector index stored as JSON files (`orama-episodic-index.json`, `orama-thinking-index.json`)
- Embeddings still generated via Ollama (`nomic-embed-text` model, 768 dimensions)
