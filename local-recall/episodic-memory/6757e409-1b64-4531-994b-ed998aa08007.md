The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses transcript condensing via `condenseTranscript()` to reduce the token count before sending to Claude Haiku. This optimization reduces transcript size significantly, improving performance and reducing API costs while maintaining extraction quality. The `extractMemoriesFromTranscript()` function orchestrates this process.
