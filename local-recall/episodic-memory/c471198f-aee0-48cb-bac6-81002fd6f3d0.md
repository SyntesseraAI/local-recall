# Memory Extraction Focus Areas

When extracting memories from session transcripts, prioritize:

1. **What was learned** - New knowledge or insights gained during the session
2. **What is now known** - Important facts about the codebase, architecture, or conventions
3. **What is specific to this codebase** - Unique patterns, configurations, or quirks discovered
4. **What problems were solved** - Bugs fixed, issues resolved, and how they were solved

## Memory Quality Guidelines

- Be specific: Include file paths, function names, and concrete details
- Be concise: Each memory should focus on one concept or discovery
- Be actionable: Memories should help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently
- Include relevant scope: `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`
