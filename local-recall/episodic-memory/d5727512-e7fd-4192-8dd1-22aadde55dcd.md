# User Preference for Non-Invasive Memory Extraction

The user prefers that memory extraction from transcripts happens passively and non-invasively. The system should:

1. Extract memories from session transcripts without requiring explicit user action
2. Process transcripts asynchronously in the background
3. Not interrupt or interfere with the Claude Code session flow
4. Let memories be created silently as a background task

This is why the local-recall system uses an MCP server daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes asynchronously, rather than extracting memories during the Stop hook (which would be more invasive).
