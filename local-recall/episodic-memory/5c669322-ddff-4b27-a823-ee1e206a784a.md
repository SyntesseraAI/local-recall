# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts on macOS at `~/.claude/projects/`.

## Path Encoding

Project folder names encode the absolute working directory with slashes replaced by dashes and colons escaped:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full transcript path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` directory.

## Relevance to local-recall

This is critical for the MCP server background daemon which syncs transcripts from Claude's cache and processes them to extract memories.
