Local Recall integrates with Claude Code via three mechanisms: (1) SessionStart hook - loads memory index when session begins; (2) UserPromptSubmit hook - searches memories based on user prompt keywords; (3) Stop hook - disabled, memory extraction handled by MCP server daemon. The MCP server runs as background daemon processing transcripts every 5 minutes. Hooks are configured in `hooks.json` and receive JSON via stdin. Plugin root is the project root following Claude Code's plugin format.
