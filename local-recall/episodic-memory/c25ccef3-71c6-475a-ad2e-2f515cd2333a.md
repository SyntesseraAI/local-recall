The SessionStart hook loads memories on session begin using full reload via MemoryManager.listMemories(), returning the 5 most recent memories sorted by `occurred_at`. The vector store is NOT used here to avoid slow initialization on every session start. Vector store initialization is lazy (done in UserPromptSubmit hook).
