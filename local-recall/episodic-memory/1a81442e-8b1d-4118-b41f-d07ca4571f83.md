The memories storage directory was renamed from 'memories' to 'episodic-memory' across the entire project (commit 48ecf07). This naming convention better reflects the nature of stored memories as episodic memories. When modifying paths or references to memory storage, use 'episodic-memory' as the canonical directory name.
