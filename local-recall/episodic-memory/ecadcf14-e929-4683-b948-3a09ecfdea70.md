Removed `ts-textrank` npm package from dependencies and simplified the summarization logic in src/utils/summarize.ts:

New simplified approach:
- `generateSubject()`: Multi-line text → take first line; Single-line → take up to first period or all text
- `summarizeText()`: Simple sentence splitting on `.!?` instead of complex text ranking

This simplification removes unnecessary complexity while maintaining the core functionality needed for memory extraction.
