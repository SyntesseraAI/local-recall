Memory extraction uses Claude with detailed system prompts stored in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. These prompts instruct Claude on:

1. What constitutes a valuable memory
2. How to analyze session transcripts
3. The format for returned memory objects
4. What to include vs exclude from memories
5. Proper scoping (global, file:, area:)

The separation of prompts from the extraction logic allows for:
- Easy prompt iteration and improvement
- Centralized management of Claude's instructions
- Clear separation of concerns
