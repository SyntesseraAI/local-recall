The thinking memory extraction was implemented but never actually called by the MCP server daemon. Previously, only episodic memory extraction ran via `runTranscriptProcessing()` from `memory-extractor.js`. Thinking memory extraction via `runThinkingExtraction()` from `thinking-extractor.ts` was never invoked. This has been fixed by adding thinking extraction to run in parallel with episodic extraction in the daemon loop, with separate processing flags to prevent concurrent runs: `isEpisodicProcessing` and `isThinkingProcessing`.
