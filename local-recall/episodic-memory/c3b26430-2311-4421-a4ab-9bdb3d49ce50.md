The memory extraction prompt that guides Claude Haiku in analyzing transcripts and extracting memories is centralized in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts. This file contains the complete system prompt including:
- Guidelines for what makes a good memory
- Instructions on extracting specific vs generic knowledge
- Output format requirements (JSON with memories array)
- Scope guidelines (global, file:, area:)

This centralization makes it easy to refine the extraction guidelines and keep them consistent across extraction operations.
