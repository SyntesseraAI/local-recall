# Claude Transcripts Storage Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Conversion

The project folder name is derived by converting the project path:
- Slashes `/` become underscores `_`
- Dots `.` are removed
- The folder contains `transcripts/` subdirectory with `.jsonl` files

## Example

Project path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

This is important for the transcript collector to find and process transcripts from the Claude cache.
