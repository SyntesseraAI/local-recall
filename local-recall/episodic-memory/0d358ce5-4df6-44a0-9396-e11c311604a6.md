Key properties of memory files:
- Stored as markdown with YAML frontmatter in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
- ARE version-controlled (tracked by git, unlike index.json and recall.log)
- No update operation - memories are idempotent
- Duplicate detection uses `occurred_at` timestamp and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix)
- Can be filtered by scope: `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`
- Manually manageable through MCP tools or direct file manipulation
