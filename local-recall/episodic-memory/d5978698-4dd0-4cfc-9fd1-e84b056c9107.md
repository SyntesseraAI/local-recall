The fastembed BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) downloads on first use to local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/. Subsequent runs load from cache. Initial startup takes 30-60 seconds during first model download. If tokenizer.json file not found error occurs, remove corrupted cache with 'rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*' to trigger re-download.
