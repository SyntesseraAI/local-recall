Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions. All memories are stored locally as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings for semantic search and supports both hooks integration and MCP server exposure for AI assistants to access memories.
