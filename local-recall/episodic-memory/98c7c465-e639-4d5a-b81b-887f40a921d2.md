The project root IS the plugin root, following Claude Code's plugin format. Hooks are configured in hooks.json and execute as shell commands. Hooks use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} to reference scripts relative to the plugin installation, and receive cwd via stdin to operate on the user's project directory.
