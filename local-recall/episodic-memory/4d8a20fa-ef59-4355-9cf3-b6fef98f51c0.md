# Claude Project Transcripts Storage

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Encoding

The project folder name encodes the absolute path:
- Forward slashes `/` are replaced with dashes `-`
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) within each project folder:
- Each line is a complete JSON object representing a transcript event
- Files can be processed line-by-line for memory extraction

## Significance

This path encoding scheme is critical for:
- Correctly identifying and syncing transcripts from Claude's cache
- Avoiding filesystem issues with special characters in paths
- Matching user project directories to their cached transcripts
