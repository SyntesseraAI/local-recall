The transcript processing system uses `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` as a marker to identify internal memory extraction prompts that should be skipped during transcript analysis. This prevents infinite loops where the memory extraction process itself gets captured as a memory.

The marker appears in prompts sent by the daemon when extracting memories from transcripts. Any message containing this marker should be filtered out before creating new memories.
