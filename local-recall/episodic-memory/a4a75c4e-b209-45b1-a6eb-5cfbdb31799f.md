# Development Quality Requirements

The project has explicit requirements for new features and changes:

## Testing Requirements
- All new features must have corresponding unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests go in `tests/integration/`
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases
- Run tests with `npm test` before committing changes

## Documentation Requirements
- Documentation must be placed in the `docs/` folder
- Update existing docs when modifying functionality
- Keep documentation accurate and up-to-date with code changes

## Implementation Approach
- Features should be complete and well-tested before being considered done
- Avoid shipping half-finished work
- Quality over speed is the standard

This is documented in CLAUDE.md under 'Development Requirements' section.
