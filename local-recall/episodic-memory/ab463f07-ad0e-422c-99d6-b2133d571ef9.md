Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` with directories named using the full path of the project repository. For example, a project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` is stored in `~/.claude/projects/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/transcripts/`. This is important for understanding where Claude caches session data and how Local Recall syncs transcripts from this location.
