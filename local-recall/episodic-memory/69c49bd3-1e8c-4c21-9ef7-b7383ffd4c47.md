Created integration tests in `tests/integration/claude-cli-spawn.test.ts` to verify:
1. Claude CLI spawning works without hanging
2. Response time is reasonable (~2-3 seconds)
3. `--version` command works via spawn
4. Keyword extraction with `-p` flag works correctly

All tests use the correct `stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe']` configuration and verify output is captured correctly. Tests now pass after the stdin fix.
