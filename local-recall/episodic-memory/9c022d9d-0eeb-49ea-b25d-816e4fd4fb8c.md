The `local_cache/` directory was added to git in recent commits before being pushed. This directory should not be version-controlled as it contains build artifacts or temporary files. Used `git filter-branch` with `--force --index-filter` to rewrite the last 2 unpushed commits and remove all references to `local_cache/` from history. After rewriting, used `git push --force-with-lease` to update remote. The `.gitignore` file was updated to include `local_cache/` to prevent future commits of this directory.
