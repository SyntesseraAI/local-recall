# Claude Project Transcripts Storage

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS in JSONL format.

## Path Format

The project folder name converts the absolute working directory path by replacing slashes with underscores and removing trailing underscores. For example:
- `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`

## Transcript Location

Transcripts are stored in: `~/.claude/projects/<project-name>/transcripts/`

## File Format

Each transcript file is JSONL (JSON Lines) format with one JSON object per line, containing the conversation between user and Claude.

## Usage Notes

- Transcripts are important for memory extraction in the Local Recall system
- The transcript collector reads from this location to process conversations
- Path conversion is critical for correctly identifying project transcripts
