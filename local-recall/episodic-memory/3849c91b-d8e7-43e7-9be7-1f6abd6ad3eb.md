# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full transcript path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line):
- Each line represents a single transcript event
- Contains conversation history with Claude
- Used by the MCP background daemon for memory extraction

## Relevance to Local Recall

The MCP server's background daemon needs to sync transcripts from this location to extract memories. The path format must be constructed correctly to find the right transcript files for the current working directory.
