When processing transcripts, extract memories that capture:
- Key architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions discovered
- Important relationships between components
- User preferences and project-specific quirks

Memories should be specific (include file paths, function names) and actionable for future assistants.
