The memory index is a JSON file at `local-recall/index.json` that maps keywords to memory IDs for fast searching. It's gitignored and auto-generated by the `buildIndex()` function which scans all memory files in `episodic-memory/`. The index is used by search and UserPromptSubmit hook for keyword matching.
