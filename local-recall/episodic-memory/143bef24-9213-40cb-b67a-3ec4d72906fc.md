The thinking memory system was enhanced to capture both Claude's reasoning (thought block) and its corresponding output message together. This creates concrete examples of 'how I thought → what I produced' that can be injected into future sessions to help shape Claude's reasoning on similar tasks.

Implementation:
- Extracts thinking blocks and their associated text output from the same AssistantMessageEntry
- Skips tool-only responses (only captures responses with text output)
- Stores as combined markdown: `## Thought\n\n{thinking}\n\n## Output\n\n{output}`
- Memory subject line taken from first sentence of thinking block

This pairing is much more valuable than isolated thoughts because it shows the complete thought-to-output flow.
