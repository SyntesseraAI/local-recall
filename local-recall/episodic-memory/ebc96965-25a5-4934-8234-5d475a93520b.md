The project uses Ollama for generating vector embeddings with the nomic-embed-text model (768 dimensions). This is configured via environment variables (OLLAMA_BASE_URL, OLLAMA_EMBED_MODEL) and Ollama must be running as a service for the embedding pipeline to work. The model is approximately 274MB and needs to be pulled with `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`.
