A key part of the local-recall system is automatically extracting memories from session transcripts. This allows the system to learn from every Claude Code session and build up a knowledge base without manual memory creation. The extraction happens asynchronously, likely via the MCP server daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes according to CLAUDE.md documentation.
