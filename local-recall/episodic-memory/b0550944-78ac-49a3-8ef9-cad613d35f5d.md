The local-recall project migrated from SQLite + HTTP server to Orama for vector storage. Orama is a pure JavaScript library with no native dependencies, eliminating mutex and process isolation issues. The HTTP server (http-server.ts) is now obsolete - hooks communicate directly with Orama using stdio. The MCP server uses stdio transport for MCP protocol and doesn't need an HTTP health endpoint.
