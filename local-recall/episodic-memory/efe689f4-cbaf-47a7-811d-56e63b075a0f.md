Memory extraction from transcripts is designed to happen asynchronously in the background via the MCP server daemon that runs every 5 minutes (as documented in CLAUDE.md). The `memory-extractor.ts` module provides the core extraction logic that the daemon uses to process new and updated transcripts.
