Local Recall uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic embeddings.

**First run**: Initial startup may take 30-60 seconds while the ~133MB model downloads to local_cache/

**Subsequent runs**: Load from cache

**Troubleshooting**: If 'Tokenizer file not found' error occurs, the cache is corrupted. Remove local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5* to force re-download on next run.
