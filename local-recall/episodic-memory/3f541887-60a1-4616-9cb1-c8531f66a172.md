Local Recall has version references in three places that must stay in sync:
1. `package.json` - npm package version
2. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Claude plugin manifest
3. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` - marketplace distribution manifest

When bumping versions, ALL three files must be updated together. Missing any causes version mismatches between the distributed package and marketplace metadata.
