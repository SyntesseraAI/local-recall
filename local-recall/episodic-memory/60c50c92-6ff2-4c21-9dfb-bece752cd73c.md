# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Encoding

The project folder name encodes the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Each project gets a unique folder based on its absolute path

## File Structure

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (newline-delimited JSON):
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/{project-folder}/transcripts/`
- Format: Each line is a complete JSON object representing a transcript event
- File naming: Appears to use timestamps or sequential numbering

## Relevance

This is critical for the transcript-collector component which needs to:
1. Locate project transcripts from the working directory
2. Parse JSONL format correctly
3. Extract session information and convert to memory format
4. Handle the path encoding scheme for mapping back to original project paths
