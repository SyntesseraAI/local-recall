Local Recall's memory extraction happens asynchronously via an MCP server background daemon:
- The daemon runs every 5 minutes to process new transcripts
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache at `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
- Uses content hashes to detect changes and avoid reprocessing
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
- Enabled in `.mcp.json` configuration
- The Stop hook is currently disabled - memory extraction is handled by the daemon instead

This approach:
- Prevents blocking user interactions during memory extraction
- Allows processing of large transcripts without UI delays
- Provides flexibility for batch processing and deduplication
