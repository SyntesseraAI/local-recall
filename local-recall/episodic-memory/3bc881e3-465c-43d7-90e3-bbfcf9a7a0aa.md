# Vector Embeddings Status

As of the current session, vector embeddings and semantic search are NOT yet implemented in local-recall.

## Current State

- `src/core/embedding.ts` exists but is not yet implemented
- `src/core/vector-store.ts` exists but is not yet implemented
- The project currently uses fuzzy keyword matching for search
- These files are part of the architecture but are placeholders for future development

## Planned Functionality

Once implemented, embeddings would enable:
- Semantic similarity search beyond keyword matching
- Better understanding of contextual relationships
- More intelligent memory retrieval based on meaning rather than exact keywords

## Current Search Method

Local-recall currently relies on:
- Keyword-based search with fuzzy matching
- Index-based lookup using the `src/core/search.ts` module
- Keyword extraction from transcripts using Claude Haiku
