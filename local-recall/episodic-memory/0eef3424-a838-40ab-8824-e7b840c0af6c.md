Local Recall uses Ollama for generating embeddings with the nomic-embed-text model producing 768-dimensional vectors (~274MB model size). This replaces a previous fastembed integration. When migrating from fastembed (BGE-small-en-v1.5, 384 dimensions), the vector indexes must be rebuilt since the dimension mismatch causes errors. Indexes are auto-regenerated on first run.
