The CLAUDE.md file in the project root contains important instructions that override Claude's default behavior. These are marked as IMPORTANT and MUST be followed exactly as written.

Key conventions established:
- Memory files ARE version-controlled (will be committed to git)
- Index (local-recall/index.json) is gitignored and auto-generated
- All new features must have comprehensive tests in tests/unit/ and tests/integration/
- Documentation goes in docs/ folder
- Use provided tools rather than direct file manipulation
- Memory files use markdown with YAML frontmatter

When working on the local-recall project, always check CLAUDE.md first for context-specific rules.
