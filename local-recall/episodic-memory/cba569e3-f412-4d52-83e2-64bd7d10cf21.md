The memory extraction logic is defined in a dedicated prompts file (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) rather than being hardcoded in the extractor. This allows:

- Easy modification of extraction criteria without changing core logic
- Clear separation of concerns between extraction logic and implementation
- Centralized prompt management for consistency
- Future reuse of prompts for other extraction purposes
