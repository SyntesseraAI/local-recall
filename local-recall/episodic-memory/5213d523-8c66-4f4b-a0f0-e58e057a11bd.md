The local-recall memory extraction process follows specific guidelines:

**Memory Scope Categories:**
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component (e.g., `area:authentication`)

**Extraction Focus:**
- Extract architectural decisions and reasoning
- Include bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Document code patterns and project conventions
- Note configuration quirks and gotchas
- Record important component relationships
- Capture performance optimizations

**What NOT to Extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Quickly outdated information
