Search results are scored using cosine distance similarity:
- Score range: 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (identical)
- Scores rounded to 2 decimal places (e.g., 0.65)
- Results sorted by score descending
- **Recency tie-breaker**: When scores are equal, more recent memories (`occurred_at`) are ranked first

This ensures that both relevance and recency are considered in search results.
