# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`
- Transcripts stored in: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files with the pattern `transcript_*.jsonl`. Each file contains events representing the conversation between the user and Claude, including tool invocations and results.

## Relevance to Local Recall

The transcript collector functionality needs to understand this path structure to:
1. Locate transcripts for the current project
2. Monitor transcripts for changes
3. Extract memories from transcript content asynchronously
