Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files stored in the `local-recall/` directory. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings (BGE-small-en-v1.5 model via fastembed) for semantic search. Memory files are version-controlled YAML frontmatter markdown with fields like id, subject, keywords, applies_to (global/file:/area:), occurred_at, and content_hash.
