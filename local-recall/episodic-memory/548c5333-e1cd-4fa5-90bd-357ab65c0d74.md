The `findDuplicate()` function checks for existing memories using two criteria: `occurred_at` (timestamp when event occurred) and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix of content). This prevents creating duplicate memories when transcripts are processed multiple times or contain overlapping information. The hash is computed from the memory content to identify semantically equivalent memories.
