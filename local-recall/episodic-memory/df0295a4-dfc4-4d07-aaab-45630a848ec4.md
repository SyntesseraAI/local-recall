# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory on macOS.

## Path Naming Convention

The project folder name is the absolute working directory path with forward slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `users-joe-code-syntessera-local-recall`

## File Organization

Within each project folder, transcripts are stored as JSONL files:
- `transcripts/` subdirectory contains the actual transcript files
- Each transcript is a JSONL file with `.jsonl` extension
- Format: One JSON object per line, representing transcript events

## Relevance

This path is critical for the transcript-collector component which needs to sync transcripts from Claude's cache directory to the local-recall system for memory extraction.
