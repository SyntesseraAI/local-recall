The extraction prompt defines clear guidelines for what should and shouldn't be extracted as memories. It emphasizes being specific (file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable. The prompt instructs Claude to use appropriate scopes (global, file:, area:) and includes examples of what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns) vs what to skip (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, obvious info).
