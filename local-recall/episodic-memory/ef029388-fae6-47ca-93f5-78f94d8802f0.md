The `processAllTranscripts` method now uses a semaphore pattern for concurrent processing. Instead of sequential `for` loop processing, it spawns all transcript promises immediately but uses a semaphore to limit concurrency. The `acquire()` call blocks until a slot is available, and `release()` unblocks waiting tasks when one completes. This keeps all allocated slots filled continuously.

Default concurrency is 10 extractors running in parallel. This is configurable via the `ExtractorOptions.concurrency` parameter. The semaphore pattern is more efficient than async iteration since it maintains full slot utilization as processes complete.
