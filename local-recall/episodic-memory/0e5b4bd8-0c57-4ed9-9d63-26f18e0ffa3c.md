# Keyword Extraction for Memory Search

When a user submits a prompt, the system needs to extract relevant keywords for searching stored memories.

## Approach

Use Claude Haiku to extract keywords from user prompts:
- Send the user's prompt to Claude Haiku
- Request extraction of keywords/concepts relevant to the task
- Use extracted keywords to search the memory index for relevant memories
- This enables semantic search without a separate embedding model

## Benefits

- Leverages Claude's understanding of context
- Fast and cost-effective using Haiku
- Integrates cleanly with existing memory search infrastructure
- More accurate than simple keyword matching
