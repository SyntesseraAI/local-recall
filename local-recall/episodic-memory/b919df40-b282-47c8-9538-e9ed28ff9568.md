The memory extraction process is designed to extract only valuable, actionable memories from session transcripts. Extraction follows specific guidelines:
- Extract architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and configuration quirks
- Avoid generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and trivial information
- Include specific file paths, function names, and concrete details
- Ensure memories are concise, actionable, and scoped appropriately (global, file-specific, or area-specific)

This selective approach ensures the memory system remains focused on truly useful project-specific knowledge.
