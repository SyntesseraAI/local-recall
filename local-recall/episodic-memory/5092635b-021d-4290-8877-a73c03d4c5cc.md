The `MemoryExtractor` class processes condensed transcripts by sending them to Claude Haiku with a system prompt that asks Claude to extract valuable memories as JSON. The class parses the JSON response to create memory objects. This approach leverages Claude's ability to understand context and extract meaningful information that would be valuable for future AI assistants working on the codebase.
