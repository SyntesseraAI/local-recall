The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku (not Sonnet) with streaming enabled to extract memories from transcripts. Transcripts are condensed before processing to reduce token usage and improve performance. The system processes tool results, user messages, and assistant responses to identify valuable information for future sessions.
