The memory extraction prompt provides detailed guidelines for what to extract and what to skip:

**Should extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and project conventions
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Component relationships
- Performance considerations

**Should NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

Memories use three scope types:
- `global` - Entire codebase (architecture, conventions)
- `file:<path>` - Specific file
- `area:<name>` - Component or area

Each memory needs subject (max 200 chars), keywords array (1-10 items, lowercase), applies_to scope, and detailed markdown content.
