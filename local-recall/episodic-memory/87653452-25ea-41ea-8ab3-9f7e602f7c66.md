# User Knowledge and Context

The user (Joe) is the developer of Local Recall and has deep familiarity with:
- The complete system architecture (hooks, MCP server, memory management)
- Memory file format and YAML frontmatter requirements
- Vector store implementation using SQLite and fastembed
- Transcript processing pipeline for memory extraction
- Project structure and conventions

Current focus appears to be on:
- Understanding how Claude stores transcripts
- Implementing or improving transcript collection from Claude's cache
- Ensuring the transcript-collector can properly locate project-specific transcripts

This context is useful for assuming appropriate technical depth in responses and focusing on implementation details rather than architectural explanations.
