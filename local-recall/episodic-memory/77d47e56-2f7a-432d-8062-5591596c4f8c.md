The SessionStart hook uses a special `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` tag in prompts to inject memory extraction instructions into Claude's context during sessions. This tag is used to:

1. Signal that memory extraction is being performed
2. Provide structured analysis of recent transcripts
3. Extract memories from session activity automatically

The tag appears at the beginning of prompts passed to Claude during session initialization and contains detailed instructions for analyzing transcripts and creating memories in the proper format.
