Memory extraction logic is guided by a detailed prompt stored in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This prompt file contains the system instructions that Claude Haiku follows when analyzing transcripts to extract memories.

This separation allows:
- Easy maintenance and updates to extraction guidance
- Reusability of the prompt across different components
- Clear documentation of extraction criteria and expectations
- Version control of prompt changes alongside code changes
