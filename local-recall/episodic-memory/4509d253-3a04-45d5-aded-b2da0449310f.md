The MCP server includes a background daemon that syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/), processes them using `claude -p` for memory extraction, and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes. It runs every 5 minutes, deleting and recreating memories when transcripts change. This allows asynchronous memory extraction without blocking the Stop hook.
