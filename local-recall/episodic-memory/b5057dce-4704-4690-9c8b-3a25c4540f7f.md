Memory extraction is a critical part of local-recall's episodic memory system. It analyzes session transcripts (stored in Claude's cache or provided directly) to automatically create memories about discoveries, fixes, and patterns. This enables the system to learn and improve over time without requiring manual memory creation. The process is triggered by the Stop hook or MCP server daemon.
