# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes and a hash suffix appended.

### Example
Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`

Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files with `.jsonl` extension. Each line contains a JSON object representing a single event or message in the transcript.

This format is important for the transcript-collector component which needs to parse and process transcript files from multiple projects.
