The memory extraction process uses Claude Haiku (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001) to analyze transcripts and extract memories. This is done through a structured prompting approach defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts. The memory-extractor.ts file implements the core logic for calling Claude and processing its responses to create memory objects. Using Haiku for this task provides a good balance of capability and cost efficiency for batch transcript processing.
