Important distinction:
- Memory files (`local-recall/episodic-memory/*.md`) ARE version-controlled in git
- SQLite database (`local-recall/memory.sqlite`) is gitignored and auto-generated
- Recall log (`local-recall/recall.log`) is gitignored
- `.local-recall.json` is not in repo by default

Memory files are intentionally tracked so they're shared across the team and available in all checkouts.
