The IndexManager class and index.json file were used for keyword lookups before SQLite migration. With vector embeddings stored in SQLite (memory.sqlite), this is now redundant. Removed: IndexManager class, index.ts file, index_rebuild MCP tool, and all related imports. Vector search now uses VectorStore.sync() instead of IndexManager.refreshIndex().
