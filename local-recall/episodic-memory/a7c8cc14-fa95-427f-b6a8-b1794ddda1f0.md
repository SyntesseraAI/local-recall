# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes, followed by a project hash.

Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall-<hash>`

## Transcript Files

- Located in the `transcripts/` subfolder within each project directory
- Files have `.jsonl` extension
- Each file contains one JSON object per line representing transcript events
- Multiple transcript files can exist for different sessions

## Transcript Structure

Each transcript file contains JSONL-formatted events with:
- Event type (e.g., 'user_message', 'assistant_message', 'tool_call')
- Timestamps
- Content or details relevant to each event

This location is critical for the MCP server background daemon which syncs and processes transcripts every 5 minutes.
