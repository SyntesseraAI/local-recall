The transcript processing system uses a condensed event format to represent Claude Code sessions:

- `[User]` - User requests/questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations with their parameters
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This condensed format is processed by the memory extractor to identify significant learnings, architectural decisions, bug fixes, and code patterns. The condensed format reduces noise and makes it easier for Claude to focus on extracting meaningful memories that will help future assistants.
