The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku model (not Sonnet) to process transcripts and extract memories. This is done for cost and performance efficiency. The system sends transcript chunks to Claude with a structured prompt to extract keywords and generate memory content. The extracted data includes subject, keywords array, and detailed content that gets formatted into markdown memory files.
