Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. Key points:
- Model size: ~133MB
- Cached location: `local_cache/` directory
- First run: Takes 30-60 seconds while downloading
- Subsequent runs: Load from cache
- Known issue: Tokenizer file corruption can occur from interrupted downloads
  - Fix: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and re-run

This is used for intelligent memory search beyond simple keyword matching.
