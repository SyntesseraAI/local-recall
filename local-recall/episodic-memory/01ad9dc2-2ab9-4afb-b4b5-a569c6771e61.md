Memory extraction logic is driven by prompt templates defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This file contains the system prompts and user prompts that guide Claude in analyzing transcripts and deciding what memories to extract. The prompts define the guidelines for what constitutes valuable memories (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns) and what to exclude (generic knowledge, temporary steps).
