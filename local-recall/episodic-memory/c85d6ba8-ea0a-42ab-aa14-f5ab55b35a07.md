Claude stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` with URL-encoded directory names. The naming convention uses the full path with hyphens replacing slashes. Example: `/Users/joe/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/` contains transcript files. This is important for the MCP server and background daemon that need to sync and process transcripts from this location.
