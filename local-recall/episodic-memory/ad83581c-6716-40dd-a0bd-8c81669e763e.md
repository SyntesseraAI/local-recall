The 'applies_to' field in memory YAML frontmatter determines the scope/applicability of a memory. Possible values: 'global' (applies everywhere), 'file:<path>' (specific file), or 'area:<name>' (component/area). This allows filtering memories by relevance to current context, such as showing only memories relevant to the file being edited.
