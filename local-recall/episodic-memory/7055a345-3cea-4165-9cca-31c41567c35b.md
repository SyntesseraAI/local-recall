Memory deduplication uses two mechanisms:
1. **Content hash**: SHA-256 prefix of the memory content (first 16 characters)
2. **Occurred_at timestamp**: ISO-8601 format timestamp indicating when the original event occurred

Duplicate detection uses `findDuplicate(occurredAt, contentHash)` to check if a memory with the same content and timestamp already exists. This approach ensures memories are naturally sorted by when they occurred while preventing duplicates from repeated processing of the same transcript.
