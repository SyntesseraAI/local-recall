The migration from sqlite-vec to Orama (pure JavaScript) successfully resolved mutex contention issues that were occurring with hooks. Orama has no native dependencies, eliminating process isolation and mutex conflicts that sqlite-vec experienced. This makes hooks more reliable and performant, especially when running in parallel or frequently.
