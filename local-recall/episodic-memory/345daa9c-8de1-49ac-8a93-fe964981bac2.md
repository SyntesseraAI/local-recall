Local Recall has three core components in src/core/: 1) memory.ts - CRD operations (createMemory, deleteMemory, getMemory, listMemories, findDuplicate) with idempotent creation returning existing if duplicate; 2) index.ts - maintains searchable keyword index with buildIndex, getIndex, refreshIndex methods; 3) search.ts - fuzzy search with searchByKeywords, searchBySubject, searchByScope functions. Memories are idempotent - no update operations, only create/delete/read.
