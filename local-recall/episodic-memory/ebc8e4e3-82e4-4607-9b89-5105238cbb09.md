# User Preferences for Code Changes

The user prefers:

1. **Minimal and focused changes** - Only make changes directly requested or clearly necessary
2. **No over-engineering** - Avoid adding features, refactoring, or improvements beyond what was asked
3. **Keep solutions simple** - Bug fixes don't need surrounding code cleaned up; simple features don't need extra configurability
4. **Avoid unnecessary additions**:
   - Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't change
   - Don't add error handling for scenarios that can't happen
   - Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations
   - Don't design for hypothetical future requirements

5. **Right amount of complexity** - Three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction
6. **Avoid backwards-compatibility hacks** - If something is unused, delete it completely rather than renaming or re-exporting

This preference is explicitly documented in the project instructions and should guide all development work.
