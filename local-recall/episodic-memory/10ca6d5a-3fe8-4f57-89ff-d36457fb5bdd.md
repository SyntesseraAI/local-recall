Added comprehensive documentation showing exactly how thinking memories appear in Claude's context when injected by the UserPromptSubmit hook.

The section demonstrates:
- The markdown format used for injection
- Memory metadata (ID, scope, timestamp, similarity score)
- The combined thought + output structure
- How multiple thinking memories are presented together
- Token budget constraints in action

This helps users understand what information is being provided to Claude and how to interpret it.
