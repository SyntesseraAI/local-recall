The local-recall system uses the Claude CLI (invoked via Node's spawn) as part of its core functionality. This indicates the system is designed to run within Claude's environment and leverage Claude's capabilities for natural language understanding tasks like keyword extraction and memory processing. The spawn-based approach allows asynchronous processing and integration with Claude's command-line interface.
