Memory extraction depends on transcript condensing as a preprocessing step. Transcripts must be condensed using the TranscriptCondenser before being passed to MemoryExtractor. The condensed format contains structured events like [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], and [Result: OK/ERROR] which make it easier for Claude to understand the session flow and extract meaningful memories.
