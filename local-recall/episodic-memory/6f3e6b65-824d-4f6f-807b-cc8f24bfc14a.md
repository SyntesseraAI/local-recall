# Memory Extraction Tool Input Format

The memory extraction tool receives condensed transcripts with specific event markers:

## Event Markers
- `[User]` - User queries or requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool invocations

## Format Details
- Events are concatenated into a single condensed transcript
- Tool names indicate which Claude Code tools were used
- Results show success or failure of tool operations
- This format is used for post-session memory extraction and analysis

## Purpose

This condensed format allows the memory extraction system to analyze what happened during a session without needing the full transcript, focusing on key decisions, learnings, and outcomes.
