The memory extractor should receive the raw (unabridged) transcript and handle its own condensing before passing to Claude. This separation of concerns:
- Keeps the memory extractor self-contained and testable
- Allows the extractor to control condensing logic
- Prevents coupling with transcript collection logic

The `callClaudeCLI` method should condense the transcript before sending it to Claude's `-p` command to reduce API token usage.
