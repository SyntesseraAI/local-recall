# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Path is prefixed with underscores in the folder name

## File Structure

Each project folder contains:
- `transcripts/` subdirectory with `.jsonl` files (one event per line)
- Each transcript entry contains user input, Claude responses, and tool calls

## Transcript Entry Format

Each line in a `.jsonl` file is a JSON object with:
- `type`: Event type (e.g., 'user_message', 'assistant_response', 'tool_call')
- `content`: The actual content or payload
- `timestamp`: When the event occurred
- Other metadata depending on event type

This is useful for the transcript collector to understand where and how to find project transcripts for memory extraction.
