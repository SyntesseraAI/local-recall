If 'Tokenizer file not found at local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json' error occurs, the embedding model cache is corrupted or incomplete (usually from interrupted download). Solution: remove the corrupted cache with 'rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*' and the model will re-download automatically on next run. First run downloads ~133MB and may take 30-60 seconds; subsequent runs load from cache.
