# Memory Extraction from Session Transcripts

Local Recall's core value is extracting memories from Claude Code session transcripts to build persistent knowledge.

## Process Overview

1. **Transcript Collection**: Transcripts are synced from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
2. **Analysis**: The MCP daemon processes transcripts to extract valuable memories
3. **Persistence**: Extracted memories are stored as markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
4. **Retrieval**: Memories are injected into future sessions via hooks

## Key Insight

The session transcript being analyzed IS the current session - not an external one. Memories should be extracted from what was just learned in this specific Claude Code session.

## Current Implementation

The MCP daemon runs every 5 minutes and:
- Syncs new transcripts from Claude's cache
- Uses Claude to identify what should be remembered
- Creates structured memory objects with metadata
- Handles deduplication via content hash and occurred_at timestamp
