Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows AI agents to store and retrieve contextual information about codebases. It uses structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. The system integrates with Claude Code via hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop) and provides an MCP server for memory operations. All memories are version-controlled and shareable among team members.
