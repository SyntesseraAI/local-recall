# Memory Extraction Approach

Based on initial exploration, memory extraction should follow a ChatGPT-style summarization approach rather than attempting perfect extraction from raw transcripts.

## Key Insights

- **Efficiency**: Process complete transcripts in single API calls rather than trying to extract memories from individual tool invocations
- **Context**: Provide the full transcript context to Claude Haiku for better understanding of what was accomplished
- **Simplicity**: Avoid complex parsing logic - let the LLM handle understanding what's memorable
- **Practical**: Focus on what would be useful for future AI assistants, not perfect accuracy

## Implementation Notes

This approach is more practical than trying to instrument every tool call or message type. The LLM can better understand the session's overall context and extract relevant memories that would actually help in future sessions.

This guides the design of the memory extraction module to keep it simple and focused on practical memory generation rather than detailed transcript analysis.
