The SessionStart hook reads the 5 most recent episodic memories directly from files (sorted by `occurred_at` timestamp) rather than using semantic search. This provides a quick context refresh at the start of each session without requiring vector store lookups or Ollama embeddings. The memories are output as markdown content to be injected into Claude's context.
