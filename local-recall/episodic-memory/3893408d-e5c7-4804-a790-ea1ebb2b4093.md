# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Slashes are replaced with dashes
- Colons are removed
- Path is lowercased

### Example

For working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`:
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/users-joe-code-syntessera-local-recall/`
- Transcripts stored as: `transcripts/<session-id>.jsonl`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files, with each line representing an event in the session.
