The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku API to analyze session transcripts and extract memories. The process involves:
1. Processing transcript text through Claude Haiku
2. Extracting keywords from user prompts and assistant responses
3. Generating structured memories with metadata (subject, keywords, applies_to scope)
4. Using the memory-extraction.ts prompt file to guide the extraction process

This approach leverages Claude's language understanding to identify meaningful patterns and insights from sessions automatically.
