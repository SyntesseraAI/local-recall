The project has a dedicated prompts module (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) that contains structured prompt templates for the memory extraction process. These templates guide the Claude API in identifying and formatting memories from transcripts.

This separation of concerns allows:
- Easy maintenance and updating of extraction prompts
- Consistent extraction behavior across different invocations
- Structured templates that can be versioned and improved over time
- Clear communication of extraction guidelines to the Claude API
