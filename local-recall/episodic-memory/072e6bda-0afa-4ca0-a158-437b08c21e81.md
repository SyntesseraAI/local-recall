When running hooks locally with Ollama on localhost, the hooks may work in isolation but fail in production user environments. This suggests hooks might need different environment configurations or path handling depending on whether Ollama is local vs. remote. The issue appears to be related to how hooks are invoked in the Claude Code context versus manual testing.
