# MCP Server Background Daemon

## Operation

The MCP server runs a background daemon that:
1. Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
2. Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
3. Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
4. Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
5. Runs every 5 minutes

## Important Notes

- The daemon is asynchronous and runs independently of the hooks
- The Stop hook is currently disabled in favor of this daemon approach
- Memory extraction happens passively without user intervention
- The daemon handles deduplication via content hashes to avoid duplicate memories
