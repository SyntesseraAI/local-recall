The project was missing an ESLint configuration file. Created `eslint.config.js` with:
- TypeScript parser support
- Node.js global definitions (console, process, etc.)
- Recommended rules from @typescript-eslint

**Key issues fixed**:
- Line 406 in memory-extractor.ts: Changed `let` to `const` (no reassignment)
- Line 43 in stop.ts: Changed catch block from `catch (parseError)` to `catch` (unused variable)

**Pattern**: The project follows strict linting rules - unused catch bindings must be omitted.
