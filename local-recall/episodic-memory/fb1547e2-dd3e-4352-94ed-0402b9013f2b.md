# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Encoding

Project folder names are derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Forward slashes `/` are replaced with `%2F`
- The resulting string becomes the folder name
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users%2Fjoe%2FCode%2FSyntessera%2Flocal-recall`

## Transcript Storage

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files in `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/transcripts/`

This is critical for the `transcript-collector` to locate and sync transcripts during memory extraction.
