# Memory Extraction Uses Claude Haiku

The memory extraction process uses `claude -p --model haiku` to analyze and extract keywords from user prompts and transcript content.

## Implementation Details

- The model is called via CLI: `claude -p --model haiku`
- Input is provided via stdin
- Used in `user-prompt-submit.ts` hook to extract keywords from user prompts
- Haiku is chosen for speed and efficiency in processing short text snippets

## Context

This is part of the keyword extraction pipeline that enables fuzzy search to find relevant memories. By using Claude's language understanding, we can identify conceptually relevant keywords rather than just doing simple text matching.
