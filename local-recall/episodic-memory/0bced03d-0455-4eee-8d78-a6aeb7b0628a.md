MCP server in scripts/mcp-server/server.js exposes memory tools. For Claude Code: add to .claude/settings.json mcpServers with command 'node' and args pointing to scripts/mcp-server/server.js with LOCAL_RECALL_DIR env var. For Claude Desktop: use absolute paths in ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json. Server runs background daemon syncing transcripts from ~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/ every 5 minutes, processing with claude -p to extract memories.
