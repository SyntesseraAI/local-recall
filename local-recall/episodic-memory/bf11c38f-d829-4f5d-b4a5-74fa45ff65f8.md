# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Path separators `/` are replaced with `_`
- All characters are lowercase
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/project` becomes `users_joe_code_project`

## Structure

Each project folder contains:
- `transcripts/` - Directory containing transcript files
- Transcript files are `.jsonl` format (JSON lines)
- Each line is a JSON object representing an event

## Accessing Transcripts

Transcripts can be read programmatically by:
1. Computing the folder name from the working directory path
2. Constructing the path: `~/.claude/projects/{folder_name}/transcripts/`
3. Reading and parsing `.jsonl` files

This is useful for memory extraction and analysis of past interactions.
