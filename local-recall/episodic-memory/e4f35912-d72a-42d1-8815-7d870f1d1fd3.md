Memory files in the YAML frontmatter include a `content_hash` field that stores the first 16 characters of a SHA-256 hash of the memory content. This is used for:

1. **Deduplication**: When creating new memories, the system checks if a memory with the same `occurred_at` and `content_hash` already exists
2. **Change detection**: The MCP server daemon uses content hashes to detect when transcript content changes and needs to trigger memory re-extraction
3. **Idempotency**: Creating the same memory multiple times results in returning the existing memory instead of duplicates

The hash is stored as a 16-character prefix for balance between uniqueness and readability.
