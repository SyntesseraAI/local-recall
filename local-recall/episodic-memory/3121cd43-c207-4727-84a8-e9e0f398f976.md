When extracting memories from transcripts:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Component relationships
- Performance considerations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

**Scope appropriately:**
- `global` - Entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Component area (e.g., `area:authentication`)
