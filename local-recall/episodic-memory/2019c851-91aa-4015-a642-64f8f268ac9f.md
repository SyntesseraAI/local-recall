Thinking memories are injected into Claude's context when a user submits a prompt via a separate thinking memory hook. The injection appears under a heading **"Local Recall: Previous Thoughts"** and includes:

- 5 thinking excerpts from previous sessions (configurable)
- Each excerpt shows: thought + output pair with similarity percentage
- Similarity scores around 67% were typical in testing
- Works independently from episodic memories
- Can be toggled with `LOCAL_RECALL_THINKING_ENABLED` environment variable
