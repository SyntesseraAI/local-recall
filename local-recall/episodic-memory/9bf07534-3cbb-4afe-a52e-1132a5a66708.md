# Transcript Structure and JSONL Format

Claude transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files where each line is a complete JSON event object.

## Event Types

Transcripts contain various event types:
- User messages
- Assistant responses
- Tool calls (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- Tool results
- System messages

## Parsing Considerations

Each line must be parsed independently as valid JSON. The file may contain:
- Multiple sessions concatenated
- Partial/incomplete events
- Various event schemas depending on tool type

This is important for the transcript collector when processing and extracting memories from sessions.
