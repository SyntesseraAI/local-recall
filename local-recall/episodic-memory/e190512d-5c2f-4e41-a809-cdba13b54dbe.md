# Memory Extraction Guidelines

When extracting memories from Claude Code sessions:

## DO Extract
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to this project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

## DO NOT Extract
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps not useful long-term
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that would become outdated quickly

## Scope Rules

- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area

## Best Practices

- Be specific: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- Be concise: Focus on one concept or discovery per memory
- Be actionable: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently
