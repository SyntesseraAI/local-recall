# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local_recall`
- Transcripts location: `~/.claude/projects/_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local_recall/transcripts/`

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files in this directory.

## Relevance

This is critical for the `transcript-collector.ts` module which needs to locate and process Claude transcripts for memory extraction.
