# Session Context

The user (Joe) is actively developing the Local Recall project, which is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants.

## Current Work

The session involves understanding and potentially improving:
- How transcripts are collected from Claude Code
- How memories are extracted from transcripts
- The MCP server's background daemon functionality
- The path naming convention for transcript storage

## Project State

Working on branch: `claude/refactor-memory-collection-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`

Recent commits show focus on:
- Standardizing string quotes and logging consistency
- Renaming memories directory to episodic-memory
- Implementing transcript condensing for memory extraction
- Enhancing memory extraction and logging functionality
