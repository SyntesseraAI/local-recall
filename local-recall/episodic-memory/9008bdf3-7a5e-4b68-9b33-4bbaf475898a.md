The user explicitly chose to capture ALL conversation messages rather than selectively filtering for trigger phrases or detected patterns. This indicates a preference for:

- **Comprehensive context preservation** - every message is potentially valuable for future sessions
- **No artificial filtering** - avoid missing context by eliminating selective patterns
- **Complete transcript history** - maintain full conversation records for semantic search and analysis

This is a deliberate architectural choice that simplifies the memory extraction logic and maximizes information retained across sessions.
