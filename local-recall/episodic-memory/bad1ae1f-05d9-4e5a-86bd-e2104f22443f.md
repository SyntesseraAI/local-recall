The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` automatically analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to identify and create valuable memories. It uses the Claude API (via `claude -p` command) to intelligently extract insights from transcripts, then creates memory files with appropriate metadata. This enables the system to continuously learn and improve its knowledge base across sessions.
