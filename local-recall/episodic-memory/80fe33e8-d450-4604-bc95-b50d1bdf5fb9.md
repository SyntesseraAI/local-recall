The memory extraction prompt (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) contains comprehensive guidelines for the Haiku model:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations applied

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge (already known)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

**Memory scope guidelines:**
- `global` - applies to entire codebase
- `file:<path>` - specific to particular files
- `area:<name>` - related to components or areas
