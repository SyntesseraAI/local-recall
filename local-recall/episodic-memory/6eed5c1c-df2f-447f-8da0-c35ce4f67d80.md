The session-start hook indirectly ensures `.gitignore` is created through the normal flow:

1. Session-start hook calls `searchEngine.getRelevantForSession()`
2. This calls `indexManager.getIndex()`
3. `getIndex()` now always calls `ensureGitignore()`
4. The `.gitignore` file is created with proper entries to ignore index files and logs

No explicit hook changes were needed - the initialization is now handled by the core IndexManager, making it work consistently across all entry points.
