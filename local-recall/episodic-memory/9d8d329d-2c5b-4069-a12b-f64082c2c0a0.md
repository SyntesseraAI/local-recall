**ALWAYS create comprehensive tests and documentation:**
- All new features must have corresponding unit tests in tests/unit/
- Integration tests go in tests/integration/
- Documentation must be placed in docs/ folder
- Update existing docs when modifying functionality
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases

This is a firm requirement for any contributions to the codebase.
