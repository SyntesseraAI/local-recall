Transcripts are condensed into an event-based format before being sent to Claude for memory extraction. The format uses:
- `[User]` - User requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude responses
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool outcomes

This condensed format significantly reduces token count compared to full transcripts, making memory extraction more efficient and cost-effective.
