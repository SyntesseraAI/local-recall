The memory-extractor.ts module uses Claude Haiku model to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. It processes condensed transcript events and generates structured memory objects with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content fields. The extraction logic is driven by a system prompt defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts that guides Claude on what constitutes valuable memories for the codebase.
