# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The Local Recall project implements a workflow where:

1. **Transcript Collection**: Transcripts are collected from Claude Code's project directories
2. **Transcript Condensing**: Full transcripts are condensed into event-based format before processing
3. **Memory Extraction**: Condensed transcripts are sent to Claude Haiku for memory extraction
4. **Memory Creation**: Extracted memories are stored as markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`

## Benefits of Condensing

- Reduces token usage by summarizing verbose transcripts
- Focuses extraction on key events and decisions
- Maintains context while reducing noise
- Makes transcripts more suitable for analysis

## Implementation Location

Transcript condensing logic is in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` and related utilities in `src/utils/`
