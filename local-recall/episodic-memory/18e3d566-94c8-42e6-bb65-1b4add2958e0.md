The `MemoryExtractor` class in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to intelligently extract memories from transcripts. It processes condensed transcripts (with events like [User], [Assistant], [Tool], [Result]) and uses a system prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to generate memories with proper metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash). The extraction is idempotent - duplicate memories are detected by content_hash and occurred_at to prevent duplication.
