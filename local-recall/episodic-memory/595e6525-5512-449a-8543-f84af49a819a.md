The `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` file contains prompts that guide Claude Haiku in analyzing session transcripts. These prompts define what constitutes valuable memories (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences) and what should be excluded (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data). The prompts are designed to produce structured memory output with subjects, keywords, scope, and markdown content.
