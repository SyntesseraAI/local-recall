The `MemoryExtractor` class in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` is responsible for:
- Condensing transcripts into concise summaries
- Extracting keywords from transcript content
- Creating memories with proper metadata (id, subject, keywords, content_hash)
- Using content_hash for duplicate detection to prevent creating duplicate memories from the same transcript content
- Tracking `occurred_at` timestamps for proper memory sequencing
