# Claude Project Transcripts Storage

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Structure

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Format: `~/.claude/projects/<path-with-dashes>/transcripts/`
- Example: For `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`, the folder is `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

- Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format)
- Each line is a separate JSON object representing a conversation turn
- Files can be read and parsed line-by-line

## Relevance

This is critical for the transcript-collector component which needs to locate and process Claude's transcript files to extract memories asynchronously.
