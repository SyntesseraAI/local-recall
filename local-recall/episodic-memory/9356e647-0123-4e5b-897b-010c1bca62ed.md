Memory extraction prompts are maintained separately in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts rather than embedded in the extractor code. This follows a separation-of-concerns pattern that makes it easier to update extraction logic without modifying the core extractor implementation. The prompt file contains the system prompt and message templates used to guide Claude Haiku's memory generation.
