# Transcript Condensing Format

When extracting memories from transcripts, the session uses a condensed event-based format rather than raw JSON Lines.

## Format Structure

The condensed format uses bracketed markers to denote different event types:
- `[User]` - User input or requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: ToolName]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

## Usage

This format is more human-readable and easier to analyze for memory extraction than raw JSON Lines. It condenses verbose transcripts while preserving key information about what was done and learned.

## Implementation Location

The transcript condensing logic should be in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` based on the file structure and naming conventions in the project.
