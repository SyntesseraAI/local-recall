# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
1. Remove leading `/` from absolute path
2. Replace `/` with `-` to create folder name
3. Transcripts stored as JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/{folder-name}/transcripts/`

## Example

Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
Transcript location: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) format, one event per line:
- Each event is a complete JSON object on a single line
- Events contain information about user prompts, assistant responses, and tool invocations
- Useful for parsing and extracting memory-worthy information about development sessions
