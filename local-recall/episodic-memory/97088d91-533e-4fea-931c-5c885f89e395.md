Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows multiple AI agents to store, retrieve, and share contextual information about codebases across sessions. All memories are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory and are version-controlled. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings for semantic search, and integrates with Claude Code via hooks and MCP server.
