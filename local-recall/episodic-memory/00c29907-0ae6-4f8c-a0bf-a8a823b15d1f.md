# Keywords Extraction Requirements

When extracting keywords from text, the task is to identify **specific, actionable keywords** that will be useful for future memory searches.

## Guidelines

1. **Be specific**: Keywords should be concrete terms that appear in the text, not overly generic concepts
2. **Focus on entities and concepts**: Include:
   - File paths and locations
   - Tool names and technologies
   - Component names
   - Key concepts and patterns
   - Data structures and formats
3. **Avoid generic terms**: Don't extract words like "how", "what", "explain", "understand"
4. **JSON format**: Return as `["keyword1", "keyword2", ...]`
5. **No duplicates**: Each keyword appears only once
6. **Lowercase preferred**: Keeps keywords consistent for searching

## Example

Good keywords: `["typescript", "build-system", "webpack", "configuration", "file-path"]`
Bad keywords: `["understand", "how", "what", "configure"]`
