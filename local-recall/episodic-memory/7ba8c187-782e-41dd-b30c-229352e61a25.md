The memory-extractor.ts module uses Claude Haiku model with streaming to analyze transcripts and extract memories. The extraction process takes a transcript and uses a prompt-based approach to identify key learnings, architectural decisions, and important patterns from sessions. Streaming is used to handle potentially large transcript outputs efficiently.
