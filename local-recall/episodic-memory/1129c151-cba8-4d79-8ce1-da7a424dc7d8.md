Memories use three scope levels for applicability:
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`)

Choosing appropriate scope helps future assistants apply memories contextually and avoid irrelevant information.
