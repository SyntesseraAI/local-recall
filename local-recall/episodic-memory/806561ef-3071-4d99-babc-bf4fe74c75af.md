# Condensed Transcript Format

Local Recall uses a condensed transcript format for extracting memories from Claude Code sessions.

## Event Types

- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

## Purpose

This format:
- Reduces noise from full transcript while preserving key information
- Enables memory extraction system to identify important patterns and decisions
- Makes it easier for AI assistants to understand what happened in a session
- Focuses on actionable information rather than complete transcript details

## Usage

The condensed format is used internally by Local Recall's memory extraction pipeline to analyze sessions and create meaningful memories about:
- Architectural decisions
- Bug fixes and solutions
- Code patterns and conventions
- User preferences and workflows
