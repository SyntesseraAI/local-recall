When the MCP server's thinking vector sync fails with `Ollama embed failed: 500 - {"error":"do embedding request: Post \"http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>/embedding\": EOF"}`, this is typically a transient connection issue:

- The port (e.g., 49889) is Ollama's internal model subprocess communication port, not the main 11434
- This indicates Ollama itself is having inter-process communication issues (subprocess restart, hiccup, timeout)
- These errors are non-critical since the sync daemon runs every 5 minutes and will succeed on the next cycle
- Action: Monitor but no immediate intervention needed - the system self-heals
