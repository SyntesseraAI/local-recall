Local Recall integrates with Claude Code through hooks configured in hooks.json or .claude/settings.json. Built scripts are bundled in scripts/ directory (build output, gitignored). Hooks use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} for relative references and receive cwd via stdin. Can be installed as plugin in .claude/settings.json plugins array or via direct hook configuration pointing to scripts/hooks/ directory. Plugin root is the local-recall directory itself following Claude Code's plugin format.
