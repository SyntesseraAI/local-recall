Researched alternatives to fastembed including transformers.js and TensorFlow.js. Both use ONNX native runtime, so they have the same mutex issues as fastembed when loaded concurrently. They're not viable solutions for the multi-process hook architecture. Ollama (external daemon) is the only practical solution.
