The vector store (src/core/vector-store.ts) uses better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings are generated using fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model. Search uses cosine distance similarity with scores 0.0-1.0 rounded to 2 decimal places. Results are sorted by score descending, with recency (occurred_at) as a tie-breaker.
