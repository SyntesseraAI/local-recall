The MCP server includes a background daemon that:
1. Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache at `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
2. Processes transcripts to extract memories
3. Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
4. Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
5. Runs every 5 minutes (300 second refresh interval)

This replaced the previous Stop hook approach for memory extraction.
