Memory extraction is a core function of the local-recall system. The process involves:

1. Analyzing Claude Code session transcripts (condensed into events)
2. Identifying valuable insights that should persist across sessions
3. Categorizing memories by scope: `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`
4. Extracting memories that are specific, actionable, and not trivial

## What to Extract
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Project-specific code patterns and conventions
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- Important component relationships

## What NOT to Extract
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
