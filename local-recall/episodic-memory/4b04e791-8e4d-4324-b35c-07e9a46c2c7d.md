The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model with streaming enabled for efficiency. Transcripts are condensed before being sent to Claude for memory extraction. The extraction prompt is located in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and defines the structure and guidelines for creating memories from session transcripts.
