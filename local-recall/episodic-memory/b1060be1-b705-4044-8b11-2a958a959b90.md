# Claude Code Transcript Storage Location

Claude Code stores session transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` with the following naming convention:

- Directory name: URL-encoded absolute path with dashes instead of slashes (e.g., `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`)
- File name: `transcript.jsonl`
- Each line in the file is a JSON object representing an event in the transcript

This is important for the transcript-collector daemon that syncs transcripts from Claude's cache into the local-recall memory system.
