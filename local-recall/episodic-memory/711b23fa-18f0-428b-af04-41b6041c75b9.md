The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses the `claude-opus` model (not haiku) for extracting memories from transcripts. This was likely chosen for superior reasoning and accuracy when analyzing session transcripts to identify valuable memories. The extraction process parses Claude's conversation output to identify actionable insights, bug fixes, and architectural decisions.
