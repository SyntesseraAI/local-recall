Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. It extracts valuable insights from Claude Code session transcripts and stores them as structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. Each memory contains metadata (id, subject, keywords, scope) and content about learned patterns, solved problems, and architectural decisions.
