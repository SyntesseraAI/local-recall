Local Recall uses the fastembed library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The model is approximately 133MB and automatically downloads to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use. Initial startup may take 30-60 seconds during the first download. Subsequent runs load from the cached model. If the cache becomes corrupted, removing the directory allows it to re-download automatically on the next run.
