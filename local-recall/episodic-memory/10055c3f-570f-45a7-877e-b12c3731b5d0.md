Transcript condensing is implemented as part of the memory extraction pipeline. The `condenseTranscript()` function from `transcript.ts` significantly reduces the size of session transcripts before they are processed by Claude Haiku for memory extraction. This is a critical optimization for managing token costs while maintaining meaningful memory extraction.
