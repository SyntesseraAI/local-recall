The memory extraction process uses a special marker `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` to identify when a transcript is being analyzed for memory extraction purposes. This marker appears at the beginning of transcript analysis sessions and indicates that the current session is focused on extracting valuable memories from a previous Claude Code session. The marker is used consistently throughout transcript analysis to separate the extraction task from regular session operations.
