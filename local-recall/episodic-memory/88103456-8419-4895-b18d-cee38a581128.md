# Claude Project Transcripts Location on macOS

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Encoding

The project folder name encodes the absolute path with forward slashes replaced by colons. For example:
- `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users:joe:Code:Syntessera:local-recall`

This encoding is used as the directory name under `~/.claude/projects/`. Transcripts are stored in JSONL format inside `transcripts/` subdirectory within each project folder.

## How to Build Paths

1. Replace all `/` with `:` in the absolute path
2. Remove leading colons if path starts with `/`
3. Use as directory name under `~/.claude/projects/`
4. Transcripts are in `transcripts/` subdirectory

This encoding scheme allows Claude to store project-specific data without filesystem conflicts on systems that allow colons in filenames.
