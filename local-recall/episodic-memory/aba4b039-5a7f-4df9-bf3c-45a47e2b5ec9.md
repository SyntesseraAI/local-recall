# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Folder Naming Convention

The project folder name converts the absolute path by replacing slashes with dashes:
- Path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full location: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Project transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files in the project folder. Each transcript contains session conversation and tool usage history.

This is useful for the transcript collector to locate and process Claude Code session transcripts for memory extraction.
