Updated existing memory extraction prompt tests to:

1. **Verify condensed transcript format** is properly recognized
2. **Ensure guidelines are present** in the prompt
3. **Validate memory extraction criteria** are clear
4. **Check examples** are included

The tests confirm that the updated prompt builder correctly handles the new condensed transcript format while maintaining all essential extraction guidance. This ensures memory quality doesn't degrade despite reduced token usage.
