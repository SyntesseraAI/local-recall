The memory extractor module uses the Anthropic SDK (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) to invoke Claude Haiku for analyzing transcripts and extracting memories. The extraction process sends the transcript to Claude Haiku with a system prompt that instructs it to identify valuable memories based on specific criteria: what was learned, what is now known, specific codebase knowledge, and problems solved. The system prompt emphasizes extracting actionable, specific memories while avoiding generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and sensitive data.
