The memory extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` provides clear guidance on what to extract and what to avoid:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered in the session
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

This ensures extracted memories remain useful and relevant for future AI assistants working on the codebase.
