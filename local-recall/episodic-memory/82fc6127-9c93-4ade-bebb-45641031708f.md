The `src/core/index.ts` file was deleted as part of a refactoring effort to consolidate and reorganize core module exports. The functionality previously exported from `index.ts` has been moved to more specific modules.

When updating imports from `src/core` in the future:
- Don't import from a non-existent `index.ts`
- Import directly from specific modules like `memory.ts`, `search.ts`, etc.
- This change removes a layer of indirection in the module structure
