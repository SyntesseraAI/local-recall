# Embedding-Based Semantic Search

Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model for semantic search capabilities.

## Model Details
- Name: BGE-small-en-v1.5
- Size: ~133MB
- Cache location: `local_cache/` directory
- Auto-downloaded on first use

## Performance Characteristics
- First run: 30-60 seconds (initial download)
- Subsequent runs: Fast (loads from cache)
- Tokenizer: Stored at `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json`

## Common Issues
- If tokenizer file not found error occurs, the cache is corrupted
- Solution: Delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` directories
- Model will re-download automatically on next run

## Architecture
- Embeddings used for semantic similarity matching
- Combined with fuzzy keyword matching for better results
- Vector store implementation handles persistence
