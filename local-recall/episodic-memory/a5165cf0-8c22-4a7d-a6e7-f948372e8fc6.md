The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku (`claude -p --model haiku`) to extract keywords and metadata from session transcripts. The process involves:

1. Reading transcript events from the cache
2. Sending transcript content to Claude Haiku for analysis
3. Parsing Claude's response to extract structured memory data
4. Creating memories with the extracted metadata

This is a key component of the automated memory lifecycle, converting raw transcript data into structured, searchable memories.
