# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

Transcript condensing is an optimization technique that reduces token usage when extracting memories from Claude Code sessions.

## Process
1. Extract the essential conversation structure: [User], [Assistant], [Tool], [Result] events
2. Remove verbose output, full file contents, and implementation details
3. Keep only what's necessary to understand the decision, action, and outcome

## Benefits
- Significantly reduces tokens sent to Claude for memory extraction
- Focuses analysis on high-level insights rather than implementation details
- Makes transcript processing faster and more efficient

## When to Use
Use condensed transcripts when analyzing sessions for memory extraction. Full transcripts are useful for debugging specific issues but waste tokens for memory extraction.
