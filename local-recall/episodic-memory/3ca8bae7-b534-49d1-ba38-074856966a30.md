The vector store (`vector-store.ts`) uses better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension for semantic search. Embeddings are generated using fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). The model is cached in `local_cache/` and auto-downloads on first use (30-60 seconds). Search uses cosine distance with scores 0.0-1.0, rounded to 2 decimal places. Results are sorted by score descending, with recency (`occurred_at`) as tie-breaker when scores are equal.
