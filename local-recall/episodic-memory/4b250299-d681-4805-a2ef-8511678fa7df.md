The vector store is backed by SQLite using better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension. It uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for embeddings. Search results use cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0 range, rounded to 2 decimal places). Results are sorted by score descending with recency tie-breaker (more recent memories ranked first when scores are equal).
