Local Recall implements semantic search using the `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). This model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use.

Key characteristics:
- Model: BGE-small-en-v1.5 (Baidu General Embedding)
- Library: fastembed (Python-based, requires subprocess)
- Cache location: `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`
- First run: 30-60 seconds (model download)
- Subsequent runs: Fast (loads from cache)

The embedding module provides semantic search capability beyond fuzzy keyword matching, enabling more intelligent memory retrieval based on content meaning rather than exact keyword matches.
