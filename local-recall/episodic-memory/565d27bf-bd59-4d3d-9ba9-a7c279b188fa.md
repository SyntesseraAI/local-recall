# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in this folder
- Each transcript contains the session history

This is important for the MCP server's transcript collector daemon which syncs transcripts from Claude's cache every 5 minutes.
