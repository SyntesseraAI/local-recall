# Memory Extraction Best Practices

## Extraction Focus

Memories should capture:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the codebase
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

## Specificity Requirements

Include concrete details:
- File paths (e.g., `src/core/memory.ts`)
- Function names and their purposes
- Line numbers when referencing code
- Configuration keys and values

## Scope Assignment

- `global`: Architecture, conventions, preferences affecting entire codebase
- `file:<path>`: Details specific to a particular file
- `area:<name>`: Related to a component or feature area

## What NOT to Extract

Avoid extracting:
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Trivial or obvious information
- Sensitive data (keys, passwords)
- Information that will quickly become outdated
