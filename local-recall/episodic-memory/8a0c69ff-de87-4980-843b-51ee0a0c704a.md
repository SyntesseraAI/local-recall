# Memory Extraction from Transcripts

The Local Recall system extracts memories from Claude Code session transcripts using Claude Haiku for semantic analysis.

## Current Implementation Status

Memory extraction is handled by the MCP server daemon which:
1. Reads session transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/` directory
2. Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract keywords and valuable information
3. Creates memory files with extracted keywords for future retrieval
4. Runs every 5 minutes to process new/updated transcripts

## Key Design Points

- Uses `claude -p --model haiku` for quick, lightweight semantic analysis
- Memory creation is idempotent - duplicates are detected via content hash
- Transcript processing tracks processed transcripts to handle incremental updates
- Memories are created with scope information (`global`, `file:`, or `area:`)
- Keywords extracted by Claude are used for later search and retrieval
