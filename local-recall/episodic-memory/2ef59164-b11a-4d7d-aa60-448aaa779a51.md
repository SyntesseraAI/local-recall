When extracting memories from transcripts, the full transcript may be too large to pass to `claude -p` due to token limits. The transcript needs to be condensed/summarized before being processed.

**File Location:** `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` handles transcript condensing.

**Purpose:** Reduce verbose transcripts to essential information while preserving context needed for memory extraction.

**Integration:** The MCP server daemon reads transcripts, condenses them, then passes the condensed version to `claude -p` for memory extraction.
