The vector store uses better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings are generated using fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). Search results use cosine distance similarity (0.0 to 1.0), rounded to 2 decimal places. When scores are equal, recency (occurred_at) is used as a tie-breaker.
