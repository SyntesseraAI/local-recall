A comprehensive migration needs to be completed:

**Current state:**
- 779 episodic memory markdown files still exist
- 2132 thinking memory markdown files still exist
- JSONL files in root contain few entries (partial data)

**Expected final state:**
1. All markdown files read and migrated to numbered JSONL files
2. Markdown files deleted after successful migration
3. JSONL files moved to their respective folders (episodic-memory/ and thinking-memory/)
4. Embeddings generated and stored in JSONL records
5. Orama indexes rebuilt from JSONL data

The migration should verify data integrity and handle duplicates during consolidation.
