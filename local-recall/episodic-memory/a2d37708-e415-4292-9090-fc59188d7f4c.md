Session transcripts for memory extraction use a condensed event format:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses or explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This format makes it easy to trace the flow of work and understand what was attempted and what succeeded.
