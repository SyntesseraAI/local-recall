The system uses externalized prompts stored in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` rather than embedding them in the main extractor code. This separation of concerns makes prompts easier to maintain, version, and iterate on without modifying core extraction logic. The prompt file structure follows the pattern used elsewhere in the codebase.
