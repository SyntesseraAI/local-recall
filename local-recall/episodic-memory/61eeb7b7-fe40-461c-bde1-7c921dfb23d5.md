Updated existing tests in `memory-extraction.test.ts` to work with the new condensed transcript format:

1. Modified test data to match `CondensedTranscript` structure
2. Updated assertions to validate proper handling of condensed events
3. Ensured prompt generation works correctly with pre-parsed data
4. Maintained backward compatibility with existing memory extraction logic

Tests validate that the new condensed format provides sufficient context for quality memory extraction while reducing token overhead.
