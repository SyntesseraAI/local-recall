# Memory Extraction from Transcripts

When extracting memories from session transcripts, the process should analyze the actual transcript content to determine what was learned, solved, or discovered.

## Current Approach Considerations

The memory extraction process receives condensed transcripts with [USER], [ASSISTANT], [Tool: Name], and [Result: OK/ERROR] markers. This structure provides:

- User requests and questions
- Assistant responses and explanations  
- Tool invocations and their outcomes
- Error states and debugging information

## Memory Quality

For better memory extraction:
- Analyze tool results to understand what was actually accomplished
- Extract error messages and solutions for future reference
- Identify code patterns or architectural decisions discovered during the session
- Capture user preferences or workflow patterns
- Note relationships between components or systems

Good memories should help future AI assistants avoid the same mistakes, work more efficiently, and understand project-specific conventions.
