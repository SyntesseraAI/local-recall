The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` processes transcripts asynchronously and implements deduplication by checking against existing memories using `occurred_at` and `content_hash` fields. This prevents duplicate memories from being created when the same transcript is processed multiple times, which is important for the background daemon that syncs transcripts every 5 minutes.
