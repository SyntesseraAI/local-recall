The transcript data provided to the `stop.ts` hook contains a `stop` message with the following structure: `turn.messages` (both user and assistant messages), `turn.content` (detailed message parts), and `turn.events` (tool invocations, etc.). Assistant messages have `c.text` for regular content and `c.thinking` for thinking blocks. This is the complete record of the session.
