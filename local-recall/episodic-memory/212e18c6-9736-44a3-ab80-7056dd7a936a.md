The memory extraction system follows strict guidelines for determining scope:

- **global**: Applies to the entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- **file:<path>**: Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- **area:<name>**: Related to a component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

Memories should:
- Be specific with file paths, function names, and concrete details
- Be concise and focus on one concept per memory
- Be actionable to help future assistants
- Extract architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, and important relationships
- NOT extract generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, or sensitive data
