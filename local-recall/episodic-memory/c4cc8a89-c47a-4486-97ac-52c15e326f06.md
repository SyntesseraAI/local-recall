The Stop hook is disabled and memory extraction is handled by the MCP server daemon which runs asynchronously every 5 minutes. The daemon should:
1. Sync transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
2. Process transcripts to extract memories
3. Track processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
4. Delete and recreate memories when transcripts change

This background approach avoids blocking the user's workflow during the Stop event.
