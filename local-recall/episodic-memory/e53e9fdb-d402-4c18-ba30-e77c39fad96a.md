Changed memory extraction strategy to save all messages without filtering. Previous implementation used:

- `USER_TRIGGER_PATTERNS` for phrases like "remember this", "save for later", "don't forget"
- `AUTO_DETECT_PATTERNS` for heuristics like architecture decisions, bug fixes, discoveries, conventions

New implementation simply iterates over all messages, skips empty ones, and formats with role prefix (`**user**:` or `**assistant**:`). This is a simpler approach that doesn't miss any content due to pattern matching failures.
