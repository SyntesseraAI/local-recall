The Orama vector store uses cosine distance for similarity scoring:
- Score range: 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (perfect match)
- Scores are rounded to 2 decimal places (e.g., 0.65)
- Results sorted by score descending
- Recency tie-breaker: When scores are equal, more recent memories (occurred_at) rank higher

Minimum thresholds are configurable (default 0.5 for episodic, 0.5 for thinking) to filter out low-confidence matches.
