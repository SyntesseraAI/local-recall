When extracting memories from transcripts:

**Do Extract:**
- Architectural decisions with reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Project-specific code patterns and conventions
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**Don't Extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Trivial or obvious information
- Sensitive data (keys, passwords)
- Quick-to-become-outdated information

Each memory should be specific (include file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes).
