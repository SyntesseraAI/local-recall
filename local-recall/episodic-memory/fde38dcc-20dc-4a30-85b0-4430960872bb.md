The local-recall system includes a mechanism that injects LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL prefix messages into transcripts when analyzing them for memory extraction. These messages contain the full context of the memory extraction task including project context, transcript format specification, and extraction guidelines. This is used to help AI assistants understand how to extract valuable memories from transcripts.
