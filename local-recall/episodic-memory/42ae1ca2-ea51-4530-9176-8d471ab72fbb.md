# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (JSON Lines format) with naming pattern:
- `<timestamp>-<session-id>.jsonl`
- Each line is a JSON object representing a transcript event
- Events include user messages, assistant responses, tool calls, and results

## Implementation Details

The `transcript-collector.ts` module implements this logic:
- Constructs the path by replacing slashes in the working directory with dashes
- Reads JSONL files from the transcripts directory
- Parses each line as JSON to extract transcript events
- Used for memory extraction and analysis

## Key Points

- Transcripts are automatically created by Claude Code
- Located in Claude's cache directory, not the project directory
- Follows a consistent naming convention for easy identification
- JSONL format allows efficient streaming and processing
- The replacement of slashes with dashes handles paths like `/Users/joe/Code/...`
