# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The transcript condensing process reduces raw `.jsonl` transcripts into actionable events for memory extraction.

## Event Types

Condensed transcripts include:
- `[User]` - User requests and prompts
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool calls

## Purpose

This condensing:
- Focuses on meaningful interactions rather than raw JSON
- Makes transcripts easier for Claude to analyze for memory extraction
- Reduces verbosity while preserving context
- Enables pattern recognition of what was accomplished

## File Location

Implementation is in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`
