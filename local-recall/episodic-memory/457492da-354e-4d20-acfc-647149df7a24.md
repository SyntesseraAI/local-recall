Local Recall integrates with Claude Code through:

1. **Hooks** (source in `src/hooks/`):
   - SessionStart: Loads memory index on session start
   - UserPromptSubmit: Searches memories based on user prompt
   - Stop: Parses transcript and creates memories (currently disabled)

2. **MCP Server** (`src/mcp-server/`): Exposes memory tools to MCP clients

3. **Plugin System**: Project root is the plugin root with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

Hooks are bundled to `scripts/hooks/` during build and referenced in `hooks.json`.
