Local Recall uses the fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use and cached for subsequent runs.

First run timing: Initial startup may take 30-60 seconds while the model downloads. This is expected and normal behavior.

Troubleshooting: If 'Tokenizer file not found' error occurs, remove corrupted cache with `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and the model will re-download automatically on next run.
