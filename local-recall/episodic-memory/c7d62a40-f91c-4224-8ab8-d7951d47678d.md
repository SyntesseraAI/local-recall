The memory extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` guides Claude Haiku to extract valuable memories from session transcripts by providing clear categories of what should be extracted (learned knowledge, architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns) and what should be avoided (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data). It emphasizes being specific with file paths and function names, and concise with one concept per memory.
