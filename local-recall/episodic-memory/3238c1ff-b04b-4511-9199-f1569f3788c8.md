Each memory is stored as a structured markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing: id (UUID), subject (one-line description), keywords (array for searchability), applies_to (scope: global/file:/path/to/file/area:component-name), occurred_at (ISO-8601 timestamp for deduplication), and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix for deduplication).
