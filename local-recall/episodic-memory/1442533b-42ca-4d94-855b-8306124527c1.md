Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants that enables context retention across sessions. Uses fastembed (BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic embeddings and sqlite-vec for vector similarity search. Memories stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in episodic-memory/ directory. Search scores are cosine distance (0.0-1.0, rounded to 2 decimals). When scores are equal, recency (occurred_at field) breaks ties.
