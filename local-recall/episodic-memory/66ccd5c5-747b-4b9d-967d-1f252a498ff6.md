The memory extraction process uses a structured prompt system defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides Claude to:
- Extract only valuable, actionable memories
- Use specific file paths and concrete details
- Assign appropriate scope (global, file:path, area:name)
- Focus on architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, and conventions
- Exclude generic knowledge, temporary debugging, and sensitive data

The prompt enforces JSON output format with fields: subject, keywords, applies_to, and content.
