The memory extraction process analyzes condensed Claude Code session transcripts. Events are formatted as:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool executions

This condensed format allows efficient analysis of what was learned, problems solved, and important discoveries during a coding session.
