# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: Working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes folder name `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path to transcripts: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files where each line is a separate JSON object representing a message or event in the conversation.

## Important Details

- This is the canonical location where Claude Code caches all session transcripts
- The transcript collector needs to read from this location to access real Claude sessions
- On macOS, this expands to the user's home directory via the `~` shorthand
- Each transcript file contains the complete conversation history for a session
