Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/` where the encoded path replaces `/` with `-`. For example, a project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` would have transcripts stored at `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`. Each transcript is stored as a JSONL file with events. The MCP server's background daemon syncs these transcripts for memory extraction.
