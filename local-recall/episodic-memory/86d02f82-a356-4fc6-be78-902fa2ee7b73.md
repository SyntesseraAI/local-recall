The migration process currently leaves markdown files in place after converting to JSONL format. Expected behavior: after all markdown memories are successfully migrated to their respective JSONL files (episodic-memory/*.md → episodic-000001.jsonl, thinking-memory/*.md → thinking-000001.jsonl), the markdown files should be deleted entirely. This requires verification that no data is lost before deletion.
