Thinking memories store Claude's internal reasoning (from thinking blocks) paired with the corresponding text output. Format includes:
- `## Thought` section: Claude's reasoning
- `## Output` section: The actual response that followed

Extraction happens in background daemon. Only text responses are captured (tool-only responses skipped). Provides examples of 'how I thought → what I produced' for future sessions to learn from. Settable configuration: `thinkingEnabled`, `thinkingMaxTokens`, `thinkingMinSimilarity`.
