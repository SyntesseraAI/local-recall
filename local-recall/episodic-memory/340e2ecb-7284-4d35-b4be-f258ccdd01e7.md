Current branch: `claude/refactor-memory-collection-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`

Changes being made:
- Standardized string quotes (single to double)
- Improved logging consistency across hooks
- Renamed 'memories' directory to 'episodic-memory'
- Transcript condensing for improved memory extraction
- Enhanced memory extraction and logging functionality
- Removal of `created_at` field in favor of `occurred_at` for deduplication

Key insight: Memory extraction now focuses on semantic content and temporal deduplication using `occurred_at` timestamps and content hashes, improving memory quality and reducing duplicates.
