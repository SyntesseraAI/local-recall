# Claude Project Transcripts Storage

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Naming Convention

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory with special character handling:
- Forward slashes `/` are replaced with dashes `-`
- Colons `:` in the path are also replaced with dashes `-`
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files with the naming pattern:
- `transcript_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jsonl`
- Each line is a valid JSON object representing a single transcript event

## Accessing Transcripts

Full path to transcripts: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

This information is crucial for the transcript-collector component which needs to locate and parse Claude's session transcripts.
