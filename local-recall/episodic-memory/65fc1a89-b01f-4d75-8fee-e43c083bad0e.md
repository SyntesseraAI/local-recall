The memory extraction system is a critical part of the Local Recall architecture. It processes Claude Code session transcripts and converts them into structured memory files that can be searched and retrieved. This is part of the background daemon functionality that runs periodically (every 5 minutes) to keep the memory store up-to-date with new sessions and insights gained.
