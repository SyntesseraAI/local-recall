Content blocks in Claude Code transcripts allow thinking to be extracted separately from text output. A thinking memory needs:
1. A `ThinkingContentBlock` with the actual thinking text
2. A `TextContentBlock` with the corresponding response

This paired structure (thought + output) is what makes thinking memories valuable - they capture the reasoning process alongside the result, helping future sessions understand the decision-making pattern.
