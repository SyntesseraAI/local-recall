When extracting memories from session transcripts, the input is a condensed format with events marked as:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude responses
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes

This condensed format requires understanding the flow and relationships between events to extract meaningful memories about what was learned, discovered, or fixed.
