Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. All memories are stored locally within the repository, making them version-controllable and shareable. The system uses a vector-based semantic search backed by SQLite and fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 embeddings for intelligent memory retrieval.
