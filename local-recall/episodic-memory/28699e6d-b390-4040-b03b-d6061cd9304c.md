When running `npm run build`, the compiled hook scripts are placed in dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/ rather than a local scripts/hooks/ directory. This is likely configured in tsconfig.json or build configuration. The .claude/settings.json should point to these built scripts for hook execution.
