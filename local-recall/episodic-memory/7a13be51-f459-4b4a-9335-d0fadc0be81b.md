A new `embedding.ts` module is being implemented to provide local semantic embeddings without external API dependencies. This enables:

1. Converting text into vector representations for similarity comparison
2. Local processing - all embedding happens on the user's machine
3. Integration with the vector store for semantic search

The implementation uses the fastembed library (already documented in CLAUDE.md as using BGE-small-en-v1.5 model). This is essential for the memory system's ability to find semantically similar memories based on transcript content.
