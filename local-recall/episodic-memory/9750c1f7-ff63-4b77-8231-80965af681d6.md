# Memory Extraction Guidelines

When extracting memories from transcripts, prioritize:

## DO Extract
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

## DO NOT Extract
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Trivial or obvious information
- Sensitive data (credentials, keys)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Scope Guidelines
- `global` - Architecture, conventions, preferences applying to entire codebase
- `file:<path>` - Specific to particular files
- `area:<name>` - Related to components or functional areas
