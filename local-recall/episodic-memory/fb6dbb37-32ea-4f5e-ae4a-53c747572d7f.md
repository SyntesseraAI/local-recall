# Memory Extraction Task Context

## Purpose

The memory extraction process is an internal LOCAL_RECALL system that analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to create persistent memories that help future AI assistants working on the codebase.

## How It Works

1. Session transcripts are analyzed for valuable insights
2. Memories are extracted with specific metadata
3. Memories are stored in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory
4. Future sessions can search and retrieve these memories

## Transcript Events

Transcripts are condensed into recognizable events:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's explanations or responses
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

## Memory Metadata

Each extracted memory captures:
- What was learned
- What is now known
- What is specific to this codebase
- What problems were solved
