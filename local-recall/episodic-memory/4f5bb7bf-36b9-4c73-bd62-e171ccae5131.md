# Transcript Event Structure

Claude Code transcripts contain structured JSON events with the following types:

## Event Types

1. **Message Events** - User and Assistant messages with metadata
2. **Tool Invocation Events** - When Claude invokes tools (Read, Grep, Bash, etc.)
3. **Tool Result Events** - Results returned from tool invocations
4. **Context/Session Events** - Session metadata and state

## Event Metadata

Each event includes:
- `type` - Event type identifier
- `timestamp` - ISO-8601 timestamp
- `content` - Event-specific payload
- Session identifiers and context

## Important for Memory Extraction

Transcripts contain enough information to reconstruct what Claude did during a session, including:
- What files were read and modified
- What commands were executed
- What the user asked and Claude's responses
- The sequence and timing of all actions

This makes transcripts valuable for memory extraction and understanding session context.
