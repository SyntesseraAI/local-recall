The MCP server is running from `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/` subdirectory (PID 4524), not from the main project root. The configuration file is at `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.mcp.json` and the server script is at `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/mcp-server/server.js`. This indicates the plugin is in a separate project structure, not yet integrated into the main project's npm build output.
