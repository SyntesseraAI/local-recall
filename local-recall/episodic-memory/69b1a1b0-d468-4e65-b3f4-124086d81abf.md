Added comprehensive test coverage for field name normalization in the memory extractor (lines 131-277). Tests verify:

1. Memories with alternative field names (`title`, `tags`, `scope`, `text`) are normalized correctly
2. Mixed field name formats are handled properly
3. Normalized memories pass Zod validation
4. Direct field names and aliased names both work
5. Edge cases with null/undefined values are handled

All 228 tests pass, including 8 new tests for field normalization.
