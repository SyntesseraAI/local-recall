DO extract: architectural decisions with reasoning, bug fixes with root cause analysis, project-specific code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, performance optimizations.

DO NOT extract: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious/trivial information, sensitive data, quickly-outdated information.

Memories should be specific (with file paths/function names), concise (one concept), and actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes or work efficiently).
