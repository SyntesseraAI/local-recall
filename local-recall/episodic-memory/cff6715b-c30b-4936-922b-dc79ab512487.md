The local-recall project includes transcript analysis for memory extraction. The process involves:

1. Reading condensed transcript events showing user requests, assistant responses, and tool invocations
2. Identifying valuable learnings, architectural decisions, bug fixes, and codebase-specific patterns
3. Creating memories that help future AI assistants avoid mistakes and work efficiently
4. Using appropriate scope (global, file-specific, or area-specific) for each memory

Memories should be specific, concise, and actionable - avoiding generic knowledge and temporary debugging steps.
