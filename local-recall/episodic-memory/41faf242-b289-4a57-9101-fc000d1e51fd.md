When extracting memories from transcripts:
- Thinking blocks are objects with `type: 'thinking'` and `thinking` property (not `text`)
- Content blocks array may contain multiple types: text blocks and thinking blocks
- Use `extractThinkingFromBlocks()` to get thinking content
- Use `extractTextFromBlocks()` to get text content
- Both all thinking content (even single-line) and multiline content get saved as memories
- Single-line content is filtered out (only multiline is saved)
