The vector store:
- Uses `better-sqlite3` with `sqlite-vec` extension
- Embeddings generated with fastembed (BGE-small-en-v1.5 model, ~133MB)
- Search uses cosine distance similarity (0.0 = no match, 1.0 = identical)
- Results scored 0-1 and rounded to 2 decimal places
- Recency tie-breaker: when scores equal, more recent memories ranked first
- Model auto-downloads to `local_cache/` on first use (30-60 seconds)
