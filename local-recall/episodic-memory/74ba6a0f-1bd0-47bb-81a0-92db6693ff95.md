The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to process transcripts and generate memories. It sends condensed transcripts to Claude using a structured prompt system defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. The system extracts keywords and full memory objects from the transcript, leveraging Claude's understanding to identify valuable information to persist across sessions.
