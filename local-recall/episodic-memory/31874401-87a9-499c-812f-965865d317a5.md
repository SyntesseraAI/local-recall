The MCP server includes a background daemon that runs every 5 minutes to: sync transcripts from Claude's cache, process them with claude -p to extract memories, track processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection, and delete/recreate memories when transcripts change. This enables asynchronous memory extraction without blocking the UI.
