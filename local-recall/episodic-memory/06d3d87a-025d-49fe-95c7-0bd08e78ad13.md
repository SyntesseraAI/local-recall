The SessionStart hook avoids initializing the vector store for performance:
1. Receives JSON with session_id, transcript_path, cwd
2. Calls MemoryManager.listMemories() to load all memories from disk
3. Returns 5 most recent memories sorted by occurred_at
4. Outputs memory content to stdout (injected into Claude's context)

This is a full reload rather than incremental; the vector store is not used to avoid slow initialization on every session start.
