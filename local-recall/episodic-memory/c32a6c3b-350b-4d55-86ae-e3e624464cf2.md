Claude stores projects in ~/.claude/projects using a naming convention where the full path has slashes replaced with dashes. For example, /Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall becomes -Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall. The TranscriptCollector must prioritize this naming convention when searching for Claude project directories. Transcripts are stored directly in the project folder, not in a transcripts/ subfolder.
