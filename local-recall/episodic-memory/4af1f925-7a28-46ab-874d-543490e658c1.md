The memory extractor module in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku (via `claude -p` command) to process transcript content and extract structured memories. It sends transcript text through a prompt system that instructs Claude to identify and extract valuable contextual information, memories, and insights from the session. The extracted memories are then parsed and stored with appropriate metadata.
