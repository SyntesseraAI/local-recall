When extracting memories from transcripts, follow these principles:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Outdated information

**Scope Guidelines:**
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a file
- `area:<name>` - Related to component/area

Each memory should have: subject (max 200 chars), keywords (1-10 lowercase), applies_to (scope), content (markdown)
