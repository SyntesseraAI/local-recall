# Transcript Condensing Benefits

Condensing transcripts (removing verbose tool output and intermediate messages) reduces file size significantly while maintaining all necessary information for memory extraction.

## Why Condense

- **Performance**: Smaller files are faster to process and transmit
- **Storage**: Reduces storage requirements for transcript archive
- **MCP Server**: Easier to work with condensed format in background processing
- **Memory Extraction**: Condensed format still contains enough context for Claude to identify important memories

## What to Preserve

When condensing transcripts, keep:
- User requests and intentions
- Key Claude responses and decisions
- Tool names and results (OK/ERROR)
- Important file paths and code changes

Remove:
- Verbose tool output
- Intermediate debugging steps
- Duplicate information
- Unnecessary context
