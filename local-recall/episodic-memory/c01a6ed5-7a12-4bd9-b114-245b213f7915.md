The occurred_at field is extracted from the original transcript event timestamp, not the current time when the memory is created. This is crucial for deduplication: when the same transcript is re-processed (e.g., transcripts are periodically synced and re-parsed), the same occurred_at value allows findDuplicate to correctly identify that the memory already exists, preventing duplicate memories from accumulating as transcripts are updated.
