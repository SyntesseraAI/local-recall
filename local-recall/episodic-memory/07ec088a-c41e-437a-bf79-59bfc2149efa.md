The MCP server includes a background daemon that automatically processes transcripts every 5 minutes. It syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`), extracts memories using claude-haiku, and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes. When a transcript changes, the daemon deletes old memories and recreates them with updated content. This provides continuous memory extraction without manual intervention.
