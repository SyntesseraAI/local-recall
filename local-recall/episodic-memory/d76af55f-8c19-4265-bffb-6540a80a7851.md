The Local Recall project commits generated memory files to git (episodic-memory/ and thinking-memory/ directories). While this enables memory sharing across team members, it means:

1. **Generated content in version control** - Memory files are procedurally created and modified by the daemon
2. **Deduplication is critical** - Must prevent duplicate memories from being committed
3. **Content hash tracking** - Each memory includes a content_hash field to detect changes and duplicates
4. **Processed log tracking** - Uses JSONL files to track which transcripts have been processed
5. **Not ideal for ML training** - Generated memories should not be used directly for fine-tuning due to quality variation

This architecture trades clean VCS history for better team collaboration on memory management.
