The memory extraction process in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses transcript condensing as an optimization technique. Before passing transcripts to Claude Haiku for memory extraction, the system condenses verbose transcripts into a compact format that preserves essential information while reducing token count. This improves performance and reduces API costs when extracting memories from session transcripts.

Key files:
- `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` - Main memory extraction logic
- `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` - Extraction prompt definitions

The condensing process is essential for making the extraction step efficient enough to run as a background daemon.
