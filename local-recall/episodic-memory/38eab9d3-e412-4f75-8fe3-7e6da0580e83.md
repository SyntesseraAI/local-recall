Local Recall uses `better-sqlite3` with `sqlite-vec` extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings are generated using `fastembed` with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use. Vector store provides cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0). Search results use recency tie-breaker when similarity scores are equal.
