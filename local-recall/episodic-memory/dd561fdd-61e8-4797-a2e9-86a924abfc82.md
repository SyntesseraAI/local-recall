Memory extraction uses a dedicated prompt template file (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) that defines the system prompt and extraction instructions. This modular approach allows for easy updates to extraction logic without modifying the core memory-extractor.ts file. The prompt should be reviewed and updated when extraction quality needs improvement.
