Vector store implementation in `src/core/vector-store.ts` manages SQLite-backed embeddings. Methods: initialize(), add(memory), remove(id), search(query, options), sync(memories). Store syncs with file-based memories, adding/removing entries as needed. Search results ranked by cosine distance with recency tie-breaker for equal scores.
