Transcripts are condensed into events for memory extraction analysis:
- `[User]` - User requests and questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool invocations

This condensed format helps memory extraction focus on meaningful interactions and outcomes rather than raw transcript data.
