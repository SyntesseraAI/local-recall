The vector store (`src/core/vector-store.ts`) uses `better-sqlite3` with the `sqlite-vec` extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings are generated using `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use (takes 30-60 seconds on first run, then cached). Search results use cosine distance similarity with scores from 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (identical), sorted descending with recency as tie-breaker.
