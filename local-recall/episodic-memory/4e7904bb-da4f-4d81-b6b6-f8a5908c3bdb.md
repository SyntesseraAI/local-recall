If tokenizer file not found error occurs: `Error: Tokenizer file not found at local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json`

Fix: Remove corrupted cache with `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*`. The model will re-download automatically on next run. This typically happens from interrupted downloads.
