The SessionStart hook prioritizes performance over semantic relevance:
- Loads all memories from disk via MemoryManager.listMemories()
- Returns 5 most recent memories sorted by occurred_at
- Does NOT initialize vector store (avoided to prevent slow initialization on every session)
- Fast full reload approach instead of incremental updates
