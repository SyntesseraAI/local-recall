The MCP server includes a background daemon that: (1) syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/), (2) processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories, (3) tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection, (4) deletes/recreates memories when transcripts change, (5) runs every 5 minutes. The Stop hook is currently disabled in favor of this async daemon approach.
