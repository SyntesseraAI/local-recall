The memory system implements vector-based semantic search using embeddings. A new `vector-store.ts` module provides:

1. Embedding-based similarity search for finding contextually related memories
2. Support for comparing transcript segments against stored memories
3. Threshold-based filtering to identify relevant memories

This complements the existing keyword-based search, allowing the system to find memories based on semantic meaning rather than just keyword matching. The implementation uses local embeddings (via fastembed) to keep everything local and avoid external API calls.
