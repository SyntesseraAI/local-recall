# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes and spaces replaced with underscores.

### Example

For working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`:
- Transcripts are stored at: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`
- Each transcript is a JSONL file named with timestamp and session ID: `[timestamp]_[session-id].jsonl`

## Structure

Each transcript JSONL file contains:
- `type`: Event type ("message", "tool_call", "tool_result", etc.)
- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp
- `content`: Event content
- Additional fields depending on event type

## Relevance

This is critical for the transcript-collector and MCP server to locate and parse transcripts from Claude sessions.
