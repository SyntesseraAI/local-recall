Memory extraction from transcripts is handled asynchronously by the MCP server's background daemon (not via the Stop hook which is disabled). The daemon:
- Processes transcripts from Claude's cache every 5 minutes
- Detects changes using content hashes for deduplication
- Extracts memories using Claude Haiku for analysis
- Tracks processed transcripts to avoid re-processing unchanged content

This design decouples memory extraction from Claude's session lifecycle, allowing it to run independently.
