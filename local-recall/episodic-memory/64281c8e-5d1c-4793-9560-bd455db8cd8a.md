The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Anthropic SDK to call Claude's API for extracting memories from transcripts. It implements streaming responses to handle large transcript data efficiently. The extractor processes condensed transcripts (events in [User], [Assistant], [Tool], [Result] format) and generates structured memories with metadata.
