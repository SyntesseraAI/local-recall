Memory extraction instructions are centralized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` rather than hardcoded in the extractor. This allows:

- Easy updates to extraction criteria without changing extractor logic
- Clear separation of concerns (logic vs instructions)
- Version control of prompt evolution
- Reusability across different extraction contexts

The extraction prompt defines what constitutes valuable memories (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, etc.) and what should be excluded (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data).
