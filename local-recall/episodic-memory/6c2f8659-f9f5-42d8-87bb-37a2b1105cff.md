The memory extraction system prompt is stored in a separate file `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` rather than embedded in the extractor code. This separation allows for easier prompt refinement and testing without modifying the core extraction logic. The prompt defines the structure and guidelines that Claude follows when extracting memories from session transcripts.
