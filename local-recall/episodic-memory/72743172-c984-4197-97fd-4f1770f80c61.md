Local Recall can be installed as npm package or cloned directly. When installed, hooks and MCP server are configured to reference scripts in `./node_modules/local-recall/scripts/`. When run from project directory, scripts reference `./scripts/`. The plugin root is the project root itself with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for plugin metadata.
