Before memories are extracted, raw transcripts are condensed into a simplified event format to reduce the amount of data sent to Claude for analysis. This condensation step extracts the essential events:

- `[User]` - User requests and questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This preprocessing improves efficiency and helps Claude focus on the semantically important parts of the session rather than processing full verbose logs.
