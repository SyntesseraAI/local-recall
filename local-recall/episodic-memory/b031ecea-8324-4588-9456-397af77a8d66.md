The plugin's hooks.json file uses references like '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/hooks/...' which point to compiled JavaScript files in the dist/ folder. When updating hook logic in src/, the plugin scripts must be rebuilt (npm run build) for changes to take effect. The hooks configuration should point to user-prompt-submit.js (unified hook) rather than separate episodic/thinking hooks.
