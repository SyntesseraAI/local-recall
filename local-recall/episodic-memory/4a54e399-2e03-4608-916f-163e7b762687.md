Memory creation follows a two-stage pipeline: (1) Raw transcripts are condensed into structured events by the transcript condenser, removing noise and normalizing tool outputs. (2) The condensed transcript is analyzed by the memory extractor which identifies valuable memories and creates them using the memory manager. This separation of concerns allows for focused processing and makes the pipeline more maintainable and testable.
