Long Claude Code transcripts should be condensed before being passed to memory extraction. The condensing process should:
1. Remove verbose repetitive content
2. Keep the essential events (User requests, Assistant responses, Tool calls and results)
3. Focus on actionable information and decisions made
4. Remove implementation details that aren't architecturally significant

This improves token efficiency and makes the memory extraction more focused on long-term value.
