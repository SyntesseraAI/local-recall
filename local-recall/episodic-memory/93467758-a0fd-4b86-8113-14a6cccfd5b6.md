The MCP server runs a background daemon that syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, processes them using `claude -p` to extract memories, and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection. Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change. Runs every 5 minutes. Provides tools: memory_create, memory_get, memory_search, memory_list, and index_rebuild for syncing vector store with memory files.
