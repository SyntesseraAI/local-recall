The vector store in Local Recall implements semantic search using cosine distance similarity scoring. Key scoring details: score range is 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (identical), scores are rounded to 2 decimal places, results are sorted by score descending, and when scores are equal, more recent memories (by `occurred_at`) are ranked first as a tie-breaker. This recency tie-breaker ensures that when multiple memories have similar relevance, the most recent ones surface first.
