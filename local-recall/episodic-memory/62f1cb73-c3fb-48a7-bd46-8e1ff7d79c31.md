Transcripts in Local Recall use a condensed event format for analysis and storage:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool operations

This structured format makes it easier for the memory extractor to understand session context and extract meaningful memories.
