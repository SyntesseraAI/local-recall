# Transcript Condensing

The system condenses JSONL transcripts into structured events for memory extraction:

## Event Types
- `[User]` - User messages and requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool outcomes

## Purpose
Condensing transcripts makes them:
- More readable for keyword extraction
- More suitable for semantic analysis
- Smaller and faster to process
- Easier to identify relevant content for memory creation

This is implemented in the transcript collector and memory extractor as a preprocessing step before memory analysis.
