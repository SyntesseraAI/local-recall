## Memory Extraction Architecture

Local-recall extracts memories from Claude Code sessions by:
1. Receiving condensed session transcripts in stop hook
2. Using `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` markers to identify analyzable sections
3. Analyzing what was learned, solved, and discovered
4. Creating structured memory objects with subject, keywords, scope, and markdown content

The extraction happens during the Stop hook phase and creates memories for architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and user preferences.
