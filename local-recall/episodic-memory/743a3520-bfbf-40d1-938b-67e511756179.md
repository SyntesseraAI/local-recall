The thinking memory extraction system processes thinking blocks from transcripts in parallel using 20 concurrent workers. This is mentioned in the architecture as 'thinking-extractor.ts: Extract thinking blocks (20 parallel)'. This enables efficient batch processing of thinking blocks across multiple transcripts, though this may need tuning based on system resources.
