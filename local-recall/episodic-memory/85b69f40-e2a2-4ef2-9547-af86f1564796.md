The session-start hook reads JSON input from stdin containing session metadata (session_id, transcript_path, cwd) and outputs relevant memories to stdout for Claude context injection. It requires the project to be built first - the hook loads the memory index from `local-recall/index.json` and searches for memories matching the current file context. The hook receives the current working directory via stdin and uses it to filter memories by scope.
