The BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first run, taking 30-60 seconds. Subsequent runs load from cache. If the tokenizer file error occurs (corrupted/incomplete cache), remove the cache directory `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and the model will re-download automatically on next run.
