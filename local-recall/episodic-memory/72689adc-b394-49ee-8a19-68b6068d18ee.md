Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. It uses the `fastembed` library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use, which may take 30-60 seconds on initial startup. Subsequent runs load from cache. The embedding model cache can become corrupted, requiring deletion of `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` directories to force re-download.
