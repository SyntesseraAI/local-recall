# Transcript File Format

Each event in a transcript JSONL file has a `turn_index` field that indicates the order of events within a transcript.

## Purpose

The `turn_index` is critical for:
- Maintaining the correct chronological order of conversation events
- Handling out-of-order writes to transcript files
- Reconstructing the conversation flow when processing transcripts

## Usage in Memory Extraction

When collecting and condensing transcripts, sort events by `turn_index` to ensure proper ordering before processing them for memory extraction.
