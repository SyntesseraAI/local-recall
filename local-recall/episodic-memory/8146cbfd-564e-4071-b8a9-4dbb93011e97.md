The memory extraction prompt system defines:
- Clear rules for what constitutes a valuable memory
- YAML frontmatter format requirements for memory files
- Guidelines for keywords, scope (global/file/area), and subject lines
- Instructions to avoid extracting temporary debugging steps or generic knowledge
- Constraints on memory content and actionability

This structured approach ensures consistent, high-quality memory extraction across sessions.
