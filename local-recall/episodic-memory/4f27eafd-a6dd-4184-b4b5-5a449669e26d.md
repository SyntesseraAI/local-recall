Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that enables Claude Code and other AI tools to store and retrieve contextual information across sessions. All memories are stored locally in markdown files with YAML frontmatter, making them version-controllable. The system uses semantic vector search via Ollama embeddings for intelligent memory retrieval.
