The memory extraction pipeline includes a transcript condensing step that reduces large transcripts to their essential information before sending to Claude for memory extraction. This reduces token usage and improves efficiency.

Key details:
- Condensing removes verbose or redundant content from transcripts
- Preserves the core information needed for memory extraction
- Implemented in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`
- Helps keep the memory extraction process fast and cost-effective
