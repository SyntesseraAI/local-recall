The MCP server background daemon processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. It uses transcript condensing (compressing the full transcript into a summarized event format) and then sends this condensed transcript to Claude Haiku for memory extraction. This approach efficiently extracts relevant memories without processing entire raw transcripts.
