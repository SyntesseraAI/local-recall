Local Recall implements semantic search using the fastembed library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model. The model is ~133MB and automatically downloads to local_cache/ on first use. First startup may take 30-60 seconds for the download. Subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file is corrupted, delete local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5* to force re-download.
