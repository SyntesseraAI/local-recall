# User Preference: Explicit Instruction Before Major Changes

The user prefers to give explicit instructions before making major changes to the codebase.

## Observed Behavior

When Claude suggests architectural changes or refactoring, the user expects:
1. An explanation of the proposed change
2. Clarification of scope and impact
3. Explicit approval before implementation begins

## Example

When Claude suggested how transcript collection works and proposed where transcript-collector.ts might fit, the user didn't immediately ask for implementation, indicating they want to review and approve the approach first.

## Implication

Always:
- Present options and reasoning before implementing
- Wait for explicit user instruction to proceed
- Ask clarifying questions if the scope is ambiguous
- Avoid making assumptions about what the user wants next
