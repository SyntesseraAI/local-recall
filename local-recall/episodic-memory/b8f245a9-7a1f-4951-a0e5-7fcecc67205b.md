Claude stores project transcript files in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project directories are encoded with the full path where slashes become dashes (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall` for `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`). Each session has a unique `session_id` subdirectory containing `transcript.jsonl` files with entries for each message/action in the session. This is important for the MCP background daemon that syncs transcripts for memory extraction.
