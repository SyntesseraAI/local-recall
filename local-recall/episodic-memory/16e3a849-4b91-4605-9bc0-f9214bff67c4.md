Claude Code stores session transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The project folder name is the URL-encoded absolute path to the project directory (slashes become dashes).

Example path pattern:
- Project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` stores transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`
- Transcript files are JSONL format (JSON lines)
- Each line is a separate JSON object representing a turn in the conversation
- Transcripts are automatically synced from Claude's cache

This is important for the transcript-collector module which reads and processes these files to extract memories.
