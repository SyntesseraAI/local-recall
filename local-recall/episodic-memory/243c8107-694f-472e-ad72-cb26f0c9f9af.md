The memory extraction process condenses transcripts before sending them to Claude Haiku for analysis. This reduces token usage and improves efficiency. The `condenseTranscript()` function in the transcript utilities handles this condensing. This is important because the memory extraction prompt requires significant context, and condensing helps keep the prompt within reasonable token limits for Haiku.

See: src/core/memory-extractor.ts for the extraction logic and src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts for the prompt definition.
