  Memory files use specific YAML frontmatter fields for metadata and
  deduplication
keywords:

  - fields
  - deduplication
  - occurred_at

Each memory file must include: `id` (UUID), `subject` (brief description), `keywords` (array), `applies_to` (global/file/area), `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp), and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix for deduplication). The `occurred_at` field is used for sorting and deduplication, with recency as a tie-breaker in search results.
