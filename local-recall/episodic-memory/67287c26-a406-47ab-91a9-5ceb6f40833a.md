Memory extraction uses structured prompt templates to guide Claude in identifying valuable memories from transcripts. The prompt system:

- Defines what constitutes valuable memories for the codebase
- Specifies output format requirements (JSON with subject, keywords, applies_to, content)
- Guides keyword selection for searchability
- Provides scope classification rules (global, file:, area:)
- Ensures consistent, actionable memory creation
