The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku via the `claude -p` command to analyze transcripts and extract structured memories. The extraction uses a specialized prompt system located in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that provides consistent, structured output for parsing memories from transcripts.

Key implementation details:
- Uses `claude -p` (Claude via prompt mode) for transcript analysis
- Leverages `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` for the extraction logic
- Structured prompts ensure consistent JSON output for parsing
- This allows the system to automatically generate memories from session transcripts
