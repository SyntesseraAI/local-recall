# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by underscores and encoded for safety. For example:
- Project path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Within each project's transcripts folder, individual session transcripts are stored as `.md` files with names like `session_123.md`.

## Usage in MCP Server

The MCP server daemon (running every 5 minutes) syncs these transcripts to extract memories. The background process:
1. Checks for new/modified transcript files
2. Processes them with Claude Haiku to extract memories
3. Uses content hashes to detect changes and avoid duplicates
4. Deletes old memories when transcripts are updated
