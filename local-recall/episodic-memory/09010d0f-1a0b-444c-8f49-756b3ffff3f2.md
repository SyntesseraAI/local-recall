# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS. The project folder name encodes the absolute working directory path:

- Slashes in the path are replaced with dashes
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## Transcript Files Format

Transcripts within each project folder are stored as `.jsonl` files:
- One JSON object per line
- Each line contains a complete transcript event with metadata
- Files can be large and require streaming to read efficiently

## Practical Implications

- When accessing transcripts for memory extraction or processing, convert the working directory path to the encoded folder name format
- The transcript-collector component needs to handle this path encoding when locating and syncing transcripts
- This is crucial for the background daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes
