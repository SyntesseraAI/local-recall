The local-recall system includes transcript condensing functionality to optimize token usage before memory extraction. The memory-extractor module condenses transcripts by:

- Removing redundant information and verbose sections
- Preserving key events, decisions, and discoveries
- Maintaining chronological order and context
- Preparing transcript data for Claude Haiku to process efficiently

This condensing step is important because:
- Full transcripts can be very large and costly to process
- Claude Haiku has token limits
- Condensed transcripts still contain all essential information for memory creation
- Happens automatically in the memory extraction pipeline before Claude processes the transcript
