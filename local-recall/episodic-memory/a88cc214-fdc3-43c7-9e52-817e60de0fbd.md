The system prevents duplicate memories by:
1. Calculating a SHA-256 content hash prefix (16 characters) of the memory content
2. Using the `occurred_at` timestamp to track when memories were created
3. Checking if a memory with the same `occurred_at` and `content_hash` already exists before creation
4. Returning the existing memory instead of creating a duplicate

This deduplication strategy handles cases where the same transcript is processed multiple times or similar events occur.
