Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project folders are named based on the full path to the project, encoded with dashes (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`). Individual transcript files are named with timestamps (e.g., `1733105632000.json`). This is important for the MCP server's background daemon which syncs transcripts from Claude's cache to extract memories.
