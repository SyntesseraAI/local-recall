Project uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search:

- Model downloads automatically on first use (~133MB)
- Cached in `local_cache/` directory
- First startup takes 30-60 seconds for model download, subsequent runs use cache
- If tokenizer file error occurs, delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and let it re-download
- Tokenizer must be in `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json`
