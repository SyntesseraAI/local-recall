The MCP server includes a background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. It: syncs transcripts from Claude cache, processes them using 'claude -p' to extract memories, tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection, deletes/recreates memories when transcripts change. This replaces the disabled Stop hook for async memory creation.
