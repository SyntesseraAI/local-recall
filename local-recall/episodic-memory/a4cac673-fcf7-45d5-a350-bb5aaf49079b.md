# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by underscores, using only the first 40 chars of the hash.

**Example**: For project `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`, the folder would be named like `_users_joe_code_synte_<hash>`

## Transcript Files

- Stored in `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`
- Named with format: `transcript_<timestamp>.jsonl`
- Each transcript is a JSONL file (one JSON object per line)
- Each line represents a single event in the conversation

## Relevance to Local Recall

The `transcript-collector.ts` module needs to scan these transcript files to extract memories. The path format is important for correctly identifying which project a transcript belongs to.
