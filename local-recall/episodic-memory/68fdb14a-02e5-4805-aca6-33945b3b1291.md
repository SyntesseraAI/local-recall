SessionStart hook loads the 5 most recent memories on session start. UserPromptSubmit hook performs semantic search on user prompts using the vector store. Stop hook is currently disabled - memory extraction is handled by the MCP server daemon which processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. Hooks are configured in hooks.json and receive JSON via stdin.
