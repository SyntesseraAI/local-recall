# User Communication Style Preference

The user prefers very concise, direct responses with minimal explanation:
- Single-line answers when possible
- No unnecessary elaboration
- Action-oriented communication
- Avoid verbose explanations unless specifically asked

This preference was evident from interactions where the user preferred direct answers to procedural questions over detailed explanations.
