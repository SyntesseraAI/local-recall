The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API with streaming enabled to process transcripts efficiently. It calls the Claude API with a system prompt that defines memory extraction rules and accepts a user prompt containing the transcript. The streaming approach helps manage costs while processing potentially large transcripts. The implementation handles streaming responses and aggregates them to produce the final extracted memories.
