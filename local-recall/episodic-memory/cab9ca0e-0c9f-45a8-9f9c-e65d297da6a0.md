Transcripts are processed in a condensed format with events like '[User]', '[Assistant]', '[Tool: Name]', and '[Result: OK/ERROR]'. The memory extraction system parses these condensed events to understand the context and flow of the session. This format makes it easier to extract meaningful memories from the transcript without processing verbose raw data.
