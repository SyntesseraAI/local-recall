The `local_cache/` directory contains cached files (likely from Ollama embedding models or other dependencies) that should never be committed to git. Add `local_cache/` to .gitignore to prevent these files from being accidentally tracked. If files have already been committed, use `git filter-branch` to remove them from history before pushing.
