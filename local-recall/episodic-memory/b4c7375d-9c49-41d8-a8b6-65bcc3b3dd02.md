The memory extraction system implements transcript condensing to manage token usage efficiently when extracting memories from session transcripts. This approach:

1. Condenses lengthy transcripts into summarized event format before sending to Claude
2. Preserves essential information (tool calls, results, user requests) while removing redundancy
3. Reduces API call costs and processing time for memory extraction
4. Allows the system to handle long coding sessions without exceeding context limits

This is particularly important for the background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes.
