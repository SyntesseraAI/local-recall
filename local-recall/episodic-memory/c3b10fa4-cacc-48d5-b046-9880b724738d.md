The LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL markers are used to identify transcript sections that should be analyzed for memory creation. These markers appear in condensed transcripts and signal the start of a memory extraction analysis phase.

The marker indicates:
- You are in the memory extraction phase
- The transcript being analyzed is from the CURRENT session
- Memories should be extracted from what just happened in the session
- The transcript has been condensed into structured events for easier analysis
