# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Encoding

Project folder names encode the absolute working directory path with forward slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in this folder

## Finding Project Transcripts

To locate transcripts for a project:
1. Get the absolute path of the working directory
2. Replace all `/` with `-`
3. Look in `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/transcripts/`

This is useful for the transcript collector to sync and process transcripts across sessions.
