Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files stored in local-recall/episodic-memory/ directory. All memories are version-controlled and stored with YAML frontmatter containing metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash). The system includes a vector store for semantic search, embedding generation using fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model, and MCP server integration for tool exposure.
