The MCP server is currently configured and running from:
- **Location**: `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/mcp-server/server.js`
- **Config**: `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.mcp.json`
- **Process**: Running (verified with pgrep)

This is a plugin subdirectory structure, not the main project root. The main project root at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/` doesn't have a `scripts/` directory yet - indicating that `npm run build` output structure may differ from expected or build artifacts are being placed in the plugin directory.
