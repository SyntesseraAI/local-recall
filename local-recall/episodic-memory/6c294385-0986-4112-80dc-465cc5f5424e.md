The memory extractor in `memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. It uses a carefully crafted prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides Claude to identify:

- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root causes
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

The extractor filters out generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and sensitive data. This approach ensures extracted memories are specific, actionable, and long-term useful for future AI assistants.
