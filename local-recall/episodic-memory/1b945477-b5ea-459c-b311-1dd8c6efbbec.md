DO extract: architectural decisions with reasoning, bug fixes with root cause analysis, codebase-specific patterns and conventions, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, and performance optimizations. DO NOT extract: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, trivial information, sensitive data, or quick-to-become-outdated information.
