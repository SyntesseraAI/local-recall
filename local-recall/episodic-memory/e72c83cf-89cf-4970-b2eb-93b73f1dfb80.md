The transcript-condenser.ts module handles condensing Claude Code session transcripts into compact summaries for memory extraction. It uses the Claude API (claude-3-5-sonnet model) to intelligently compress transcripts while preserving key information about user interactions, code changes, and decisions made during the session. This is part of the memory extraction pipeline that helps future sessions understand context and decisions from past work.
