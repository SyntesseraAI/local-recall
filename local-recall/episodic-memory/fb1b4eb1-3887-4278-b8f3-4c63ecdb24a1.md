To enable the MCP server for memory tools in Claude Code, it must be configured in `.claude/settings.json` under `mcpServers`. The server should reference the built script at `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/dist/mcp-server/server.js` and set `LOCAL_RECALL_DIR` environment variable to point to the local-recall directory.
