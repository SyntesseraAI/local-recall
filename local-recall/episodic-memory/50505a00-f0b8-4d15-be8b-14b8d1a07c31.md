The system implements transcript condensing as a preprocessing step before memory extraction. This condenses transcripts into key events (User requests, Assistant responses, Tool invocations, Results) to reduce token usage when sending to Claude for memory extraction. This pattern improves efficiency when processing large transcripts.
