Each memory file is stored as markdown with YAML frontmatter containing: id (UUID), subject (brief description), keywords (array), applies_to (scope), occurred_at (ISO-8601), and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix). The actual memory content goes in the markdown body. Memory files are version-controlled in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory and are atomic (one concept per file).
