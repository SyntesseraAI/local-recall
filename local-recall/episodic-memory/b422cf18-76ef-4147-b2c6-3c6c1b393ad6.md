# Transcript JSON Lines Format

Each line in a `.jsonl` transcript file is a JSON object representing an event in the conversation.

## Event Types

- **User messages**: `{"type": "user", "content": "..."}`
- **Assistant messages**: `{"type": "assistant", "content": "..."}`
- **Tool calls**: `{"type": "tool_call", "tool_name": "...", "parameters": {...}}`
- **Tool results**: `{"type": "tool_result", "tool_name": "...", "result": "..."}`

## Important for Memory Extraction

When processing transcripts for memory extraction:
- Parse as JSON Lines (one object per line)
- Process events in order to understand context
- Extract memories based on what was learned, solved, or decided
- Include relevant file paths, function names, and specific details
- Use appropriate scope (global, file:path, or area:name)
