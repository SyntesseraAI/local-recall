The memory extractor analyzes transcripts in a condensed event format with entries like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]`. This structured format helps the Claude Haiku model understand what happened during a session. The extraction process uses this format to identify sessions where valuable memories can be extracted, focusing on what was learned, what is now known, what is specific to the codebase, and what problems were solved.
