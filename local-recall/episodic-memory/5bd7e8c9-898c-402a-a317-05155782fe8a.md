Memory extraction should identify: architectural decisions and reasoning, bug fixes and root causes, code patterns specific to the project, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, and performance optimizations. Should NOT extract: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, trivial information, sensitive data, or quickly-outdated information.
