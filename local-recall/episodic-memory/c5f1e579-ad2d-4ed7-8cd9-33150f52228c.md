Local Recall uses BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) which is cached in `local_cache/`. First run downloads model (30-60 seconds). If tokenizer error occurs (incomplete/corrupted cache), delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` directory to force re-download on next run. Model cache is gitignored.
