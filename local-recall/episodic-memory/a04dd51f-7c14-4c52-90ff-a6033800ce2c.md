Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files stored locally in the repository. It provides semantic search via vector embeddings, hooks for Claude Code integration (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit), and an MCP server for memory tools (create, get, search, list, index_rebuild).
