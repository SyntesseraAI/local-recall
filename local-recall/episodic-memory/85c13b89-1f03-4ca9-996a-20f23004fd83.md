## Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The project implements transcript condensing to improve memory extraction efficiency:

- **Raw transcripts**: Can be very long with many granular events
- **Condensed format**: Summarizes related events (e.g., 'Tool: Read, Tool: Edit, Result: OK' becomes a single condensed event)
- **Benefits**: Makes memory extraction more efficient and focused on meaningful insights
- **Implementation**: The transcript collector should condense transcripts before passing them to Claude for memory extraction
- **Use case**: MCP server daemon processes transcripts and extracts memories from the condensed version

This approach reduces token usage and improves the quality of extracted memories by focusing on actual work done rather than verbose event logs.
