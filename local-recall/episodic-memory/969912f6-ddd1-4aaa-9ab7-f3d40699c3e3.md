# Transcript Condensation Process

The transcript condensation process in this project extracts valuable events from raw transcripts while removing verbose details. The condensed format includes:

- `[User]` - User questions and requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This condensed format is designed for memory extraction, making it easier to identify what was learned, what problems were solved, and what patterns were applied during the session.

The condensation removes unnecessary dialogue while preserving actionable information about technical decisions, code changes, and discovered patterns.
