The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) to process session transcripts. It sends transcripts to Claude with a system prompt that defines memory extraction rules, then parses the response to create structured memory objects. The extraction is idempotent - calling `createMemory()` multiple times with the same transcript content won't create duplicates due to content hash checking.
