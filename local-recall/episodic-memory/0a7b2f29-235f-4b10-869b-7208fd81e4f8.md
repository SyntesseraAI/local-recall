Local Recall uses the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (via fastembed library) for semantic search across memories. This enables finding relevant memories based on semantic similarity rather than just keyword matching. The embedding model is cached in `local_cache/` directory (~133MB) and downloads automatically on first run. This approach provides better relevance when searching memories compared to pure keyword-based search.
