The MCP server includes a background daemon that:
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/)
- Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
- Runs on a 5-minute interval

Note: The Stop hook is currently disabled in favor of this asynchronous background processing.
