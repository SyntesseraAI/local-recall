The hook system receives the user's working directory via the `cwd` parameter in the JSON input. This allows hooks to operate on the correct project directory even when the local-recall plugin is installed globally or in a different location. The SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks should use this `cwd` to read memories and build the index relative to the user's project, not the plugin installation directory.
