Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use.

**First run consideration**: Initial startup may take 30-60 seconds while the model downloads. Subsequent runs load from cache.

**Troubleshooting**: If you see "Tokenizer file not found" error, the cache is corrupted - remove `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and it will re-download.

Search results use cosine distance similarity with scores 0.0-1.0, rounded to 2 decimals, with recency tie-breaking.
