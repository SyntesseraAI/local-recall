# Memory Extraction Architecture

Local-recall uses a background daemon (part of the MCP server) that:
1. Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache every 5 minutes
2. Processes transcripts using Claude to identify valuable memories
3. Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
4. Creates or updates memories based on extracted content
5. Handles deduplication to avoid creating duplicate memories

This asynchronous approach allows the system to learn from every session without blocking the user's workflow.
