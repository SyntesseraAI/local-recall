The Stop hook is currently disabled. Memory extraction is instead handled by the MCP server daemon which:
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
- Processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes
- Uses `claude -p` to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
