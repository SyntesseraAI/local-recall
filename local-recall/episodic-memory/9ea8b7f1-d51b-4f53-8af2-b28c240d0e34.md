The vector store (`src/core/vector-store.ts`) uses `better-sqlite3` with the `sqlite-vec` extension for vector similarity search. Uses `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for embeddings (~133MB). Scoring uses cosine distance (0.0 to 1.0 range, rounded to 2 decimal places). Results ranked by similarity score descending, with recency (`occurred_at`) as tie-breaker for equal scores.
