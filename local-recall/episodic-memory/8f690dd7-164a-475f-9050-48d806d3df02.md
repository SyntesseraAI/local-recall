The `isSyntheticFile()` utility function exists in transcript-collector and can identify synthetic transcripts by their file paths. This function should be used BEFORE file operations (copying, processing) rather than after, to avoid wasted I/O and processing on files that will be discarded.

When syncing or processing transcripts from any source, check `isSyntheticFile()` before:
- Copying files
- Creating memories
- Processing transcripts

This prevents cascading cleanup operations and keeps the system efficient.
