# FastEmbed Model Cache

Local Recall uses the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for embeddings (~133MB).

## Cache Location

The model is cached at `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` and includes:
- Model weights
- Tokenizer configuration (tokenizer.json)
- Vocabulary files

## Known Issues

1. **Corrupted Cache**: If the download is interrupted, files may be incomplete
   - Error: "Tokenizer file not found at local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json"
   - Solution: Delete the entire `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` directory
   - The model will re-download automatically on next run

2. **First Run Performance**: Initial startup takes 30-60 seconds while downloading the model
   - This only happens once due to caching
   - Subsequent runs load from the local cache instantly

3. **Disk Space**: Requires ~133MB for the model plus additional space for the vectorstore
