# Transcript Structure for Memory Extraction

For effective memory extraction, transcripts must contain structured information about Claude's reasoning and responses.

## Required Elements

The transcript should capture:
- **User prompts**: What the user asked
- **Claude's thoughts/reasoning**: How Claude approached the problem
- **Claude's responses**: What Claude produced
- **Tool invocations**: What tools were used and results
- **Timestamps**: When events occurred

## Importance for Memory Extraction

The memory extraction process uses these structured elements to identify:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions
- Solutions to specific problems
- Performance considerations

Without clear separation between user input, assistant reasoning, and results, memory extraction becomes less accurate.
