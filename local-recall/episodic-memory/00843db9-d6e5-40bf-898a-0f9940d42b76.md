The MCP server runs a background daemon that syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, processes them using 'claude -p' to extract memories, tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection, and deletes/recreates memories when transcripts change. This runs every 5 minutes. The Stop hook is currently disabled in favor of this async daemon approach.
