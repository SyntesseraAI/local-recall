The vector store uses `better-sqlite3` with the `sqlite-vec` extension for efficient similarity search. Embeddings are generated with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model. Search results use cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0), rounded to 2 decimal places. When scores are equal, recency (occurred_at) acts as a tie-breaker, favoring more recent memories.
