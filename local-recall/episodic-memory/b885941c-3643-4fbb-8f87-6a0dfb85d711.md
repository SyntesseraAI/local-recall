Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files stored in local-recall/episodic-memory/. The system uses fastembed (BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic search with SQLite vector storage. All memories are version-controlled git files with YAML frontmatter metadata including id, subject, keywords, applies_to scope, occurred_at timestamp, and content_hash for deduplication.
