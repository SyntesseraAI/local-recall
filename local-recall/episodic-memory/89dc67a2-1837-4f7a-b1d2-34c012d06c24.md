Memory extraction logic is defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This module contains the prompts and instructions used by the memory extractor to analyze transcripts and determine what information should be stored as memories. Separating prompts into a dedicated module allows for easier maintenance and iteration on extraction rules.
