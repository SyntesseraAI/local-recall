The Local Recall system has three hooks that work together:

1. **SessionStart** - Loads 5 most recent episodic memories at session start (verified: 8 memories loaded)
2. **UserPromptSubmit** - Searches and injects relevant episodic and thinking memories before Claude processes prompts
3. **Stop** - Fires at session end, processes the transcript, and creates new memories automatically (verified in recall.log)

This creates a complete cycle: memories loaded → memories searched → new memories created. The system is fully operational and requires no additional fixes.
