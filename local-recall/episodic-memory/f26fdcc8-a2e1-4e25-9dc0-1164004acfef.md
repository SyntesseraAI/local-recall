Local Recall uses BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) for semantic search. First startup may take 30-60 seconds while model downloads to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`. Subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file is missing or corrupted (Error: Tokenizer file not found), remove the corrupted cache directory and re-run to automatically re-download.
