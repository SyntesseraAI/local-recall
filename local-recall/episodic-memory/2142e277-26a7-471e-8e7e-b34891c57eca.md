Vector store implementation uses better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for semantic search. Uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for embeddings. Cosine distance similarity scoring ranges 0.0-1.0, rounded to 2 decimals. Results ranked by score descending with recency tie-breaker using occurred_at timestamp. Model auto-downloads to local_cache/ on first use (30-60 seconds).
