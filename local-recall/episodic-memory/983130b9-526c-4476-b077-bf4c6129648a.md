Local Recall uses fastembed with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search embeddings (~133MB). The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use.

**Performance Characteristics:**
- First run: 30-60 seconds (initial download)
- Subsequent runs: Load from cache (fast)
- If tokenizer.json not found, remove corrupted cache and it will re-download automatically

This is why vector store is not used in SessionStart hook - initialization would be slow on every session start. Instead, UserPromptSubmit hook does lazy initialization with caching.
