Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter. It uses vector embeddings (fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic search, SQLite for storage, and provides both Claude Code hooks and MCP server integration for memory access.
