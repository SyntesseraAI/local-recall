# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:

- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcript file: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/index.jsonl`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as newline-delimited JSON (JSONL), where each line is a complete JSON event object containing:
- Message content from both user and assistant
- Tool invocations and results
- Metadata about the conversation

This information is critical for the transcript-collector and memory extraction systems, as they need to locate and parse these files to extract memories from completed sessions.
