# Transcript Condensing

When processing transcripts for memory extraction, condensing is an important optimization technique.

## Why Condense

- Transcripts can become very long and expensive to process with LLMs
- Condensing reduces token usage while retaining important information
- Improves response quality by removing noise and redundancy

## Implementation

The project has implemented transcript condensing as part of the memory extraction pipeline to make LLM processing more efficient.

## Considerations

- Preserve important context and decisions
- Remove verbose debugging output
- Keep specific details like file paths and function names
- Maintain chronological order of events
