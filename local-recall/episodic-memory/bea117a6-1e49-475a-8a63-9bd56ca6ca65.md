The memory-extractor.ts module uses the Claude API (Anthropic SDK) with streaming enabled for processing transcripts and extracting memories. This approach allows for efficient handling of potentially large transcript data by streaming the response rather than waiting for the full completion.

Key implementation details:
- Uses `client.messages.stream()` for streaming responses
- Processes transcript data through a structured prompt system
- Handles token counting and message formatting
- Integrates with the memory creation system for storing extracted memories
