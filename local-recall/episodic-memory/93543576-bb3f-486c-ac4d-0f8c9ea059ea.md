Memory markdown files in local-recall/episodic-memory/ are intentionally version-controlled in git for sharing across team members. However, local-recall/memory.sqlite and recall.log are gitignored as they are auto-generated. The .gitignore file is auto-managed by the system. This separation allows team collaboration on memories while avoiding database conflicts.
