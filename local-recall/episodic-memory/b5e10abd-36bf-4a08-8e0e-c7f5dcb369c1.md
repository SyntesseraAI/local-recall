Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. The project enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files. Key directories: `src/core/` for memory management, `src/hooks/` for Claude Code hooks, `src/mcp-server/` for MCP implementation, and `local-recall/episodic-memory/` for storing individual memory markdown files.
