The memory-extractor module uses the Anthropic Claude API client to extract memories from transcripts. It implements streaming responses for efficient processing of large transcripts. The module handles transcript condensing and memory generation through API calls, with specific prompts defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts.
