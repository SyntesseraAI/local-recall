Claude Code stores transcript files in `~/.claude/projects/` with subdirectories that use path-encoded project paths. The directory name format appears to be the full filesystem path encoded (hyphens replacing slashes). Transcripts are stored as JSONL files within these project directories. This is important for the MCP server's background daemon which needs to locate and process transcripts for memory extraction.
