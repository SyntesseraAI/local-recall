The memory extractor module (src/core/memory-extractor.ts) uses Claude's API to intelligently extract memories from transcripts. It employs a structured prompt that guides Claude to identify significant events, decisions, and learnings. The extraction process involves:

1. Processing transcript content through Claude Haiku
2. Using a detailed system prompt to identify memory-worthy content
3. Returning structured memory objects with metadata
4. Filtering out trivial or temporary information

The prompt engineering approach ensures extracted memories are:
- Specific and actionable
- Properly scoped (global, file, or area-specific)
- Tagged with appropriate keywords for later searching
- Focused on lasting knowledge rather than temporary debugging steps
