Development guidelines:
- All new features must have corresponding unit tests in tests/unit/
- Integration tests go in tests/integration/
- Documentation must be placed in docs/ folder
- Update existing docs when modifying functionality
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases
- Use npm scripts: build, dev (watch mode), test, lint, mcp:start
