Memory extraction instructions and prompts are centralized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This file contains the prompt definitions that guide Claude Haiku in extracting valuable memories from transcripts.

This separation allows:
- Easy updates to extraction criteria without changing the extractor logic
- Consistent prompting across extraction sessions
- Clear documentation of what constitutes valuable memories for the system
