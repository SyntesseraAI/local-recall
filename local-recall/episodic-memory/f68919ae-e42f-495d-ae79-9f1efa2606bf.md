The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model invoked via stdio with streaming enabled. The system sends prompts via stdin and processes the model's response line-by-line. This approach allows for real-time memory generation from transcripts without loading entire responses into memory at once.
