# Memory Extraction Granularity

When extracting memories from session transcripts, each memory should focus on a single concept or discovery. This improves searchability and reusability.

## Example

Instead of creating one large memory that includes multiple facts:
- ❌ "Transcript location, format, and processing details"

Create separate memories for each piece of information:
- ✅ "Claude project transcripts are stored at ~/.claude/projects/"
- ✅ "Transcripts use JSON Lines format with .jsonl extension"
- ✅ "Memory extraction happens via background daemon every 5 minutes"

## Benefits

- **Better search**: Each memory can be found with specific keywords
- **Reusability**: A memory about transcript format can be relevant in multiple contexts
- **Clarity**: Focused memories are easier to understand and apply
- **Maintenance**: Updates to one concept don't affect unrelated information
