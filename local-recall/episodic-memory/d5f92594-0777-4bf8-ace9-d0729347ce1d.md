# Transcript Collector Requirements

The transcript collector needs to:

1. Scan the `~/.claude/projects/` directory to find all project folders
2. Filter for folders matching the current working directory (with path conversion)
3. Read all `.jsonl` files from the `transcripts/` subdirectory
4. Process each transcript to extract memories

## Implementation Considerations

- Multiple transcript files may exist for a single project
- Transcripts are in JSONL format (one JSON object per line)
- The path conversion logic (slashes to dashes) is essential for matching projects
- Need to handle cases where the transcripts directory doesn't exist yet
