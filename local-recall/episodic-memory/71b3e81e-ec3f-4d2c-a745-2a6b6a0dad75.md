The thinking memory storage has been migrated to use JSONL format with padded 6-digit suffixes. Files are named as `thinking-000001.jsonl`, `thinking-000002.jsonl`, etc., not a single `thinking.jsonl` file.

If a bare `thinking.jsonl` file exists, it's likely a remnant from an older storage format and should be deleted as part of the migration cleanup.

Relevant files:
- `src/core/thinking-jsonl-store.ts` - Handles the JSONL storage with padded filenames
- `src/core/migration.ts` - Handles migration between old and new storage formats

This pattern prevents any single file from becoming too large and allows for better file organization.
