# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with the naming pattern:
- `<timestamp>-<some-id>.jsonl`
- Example: `1733055936-01JCN0PNV0WqXX0000000001.jsonl`

Each line in the JSONL file is a complete JSON object representing a turn in the conversation (either user message or assistant response).

## Important Notes

- The transcript path is passed to hooks via stdin as JSON
- Absolute paths with slashes are replaced by dashes for the folder name
- This location is used by the background daemon for transcript processing
- The MCP server reads from this location when syncing transcripts
