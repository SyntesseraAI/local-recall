# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files:
- File name format: `<session-id>.jsonl`
- Each line is a JSON object representing a single event/message
- Fields include: `type`, `timestamp`, `role` (user/assistant), `content`

## Key Details

- The `~/.claude/projects/` directory is created and managed by Claude Code
- Each project's transcripts are isolated in their own directory
- Transcripts persist across sessions for the same project
