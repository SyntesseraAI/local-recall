# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory:
- The path is URL-encoded (spaces become %20, slashes become %2F)
- For example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `%2FUsers%2Fjoe%2FCode%2FSyntessera%2Flocal-recall`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in: `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/transcripts/`

Each transcript file:
- Is named with a timestamp (e.g., `2025-12-01T15-30-45-123Z.jsonl`)
- Contains one JSON object per line
- Each line represents a transcript event (user message, assistant response, tool call, etc.)

## Accessing Transcripts Programmatically

When implementing transcript collection:
1. Read the `cwd` from the hook context
2. URL-encode the path: use `encodeURIComponent()` for each path segment, then join with encoded slashes
3. Construct the path: `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/transcripts/`
4. Read all `.jsonl` files from this directory
5. Parse each line as JSON to reconstruct the transcript

This is how the local-recall MCP daemon accesses transcripts for memory extraction.
