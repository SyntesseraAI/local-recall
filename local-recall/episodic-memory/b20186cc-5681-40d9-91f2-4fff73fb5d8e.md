The memory extraction system is a critical component of Local Recall's transcript processing pipeline:

1. Transcripts are collected from Claude's cache
2. The memory extractor analyzes these transcripts using Claude's API
3. Extracted memories are validated and deduplicated
4. Memories are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` as markdown files
5. The index is rebuilt to include new memories in search

This pipeline runs as a background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously, enabling Local Recall to automatically learn from coding sessions without manual intervention.
