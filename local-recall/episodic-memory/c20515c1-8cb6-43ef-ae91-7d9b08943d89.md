The memory extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` is a critical component that guides Claude in analyzing transcripts to identify valuable memories. The prompt should:

- Define clear criteria for what constitutes a valuable memory
- Guide the model to extract specific, actionable information
- Ensure memories follow the project's format (YAML frontmatter + markdown)
- Filter out trivial or temporary information
- Focus on architectural decisions, patterns, solutions, and learnings

The quality of extracted memories depends heavily on this prompt's clarity and specificity. Future improvements to memory extraction should prioritize refining this prompt.
