# Session ID in Transcript Events

When parsing Claude Code transcript JSONL files, session metadata is available in the transcript events.

## Known Information

Session IDs appear to be included in the transcript data, allowing the transcript collector to:
1. Identify which session a transcript belongs to
2. Track multiple sessions in the same project
3. Link transcripts to specific session contexts

## Implementation Consideration

The exact field name and structure for session ID in the JSONL events needs verification by examining actual transcript files. The transcript collector should parse these events to extract the session identifier.
