The memory extraction system processes condensed transcripts that are broken down into events:
- `[User]` - User requests/questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude responses/explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations with their names
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool invocations

This event-based format allows for more efficient analysis than full transcripts and helps extract meaningful memories from session activities.
