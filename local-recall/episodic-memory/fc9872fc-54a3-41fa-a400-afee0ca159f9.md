The memory extraction system uses the Anthropic SDK to call Claude's API (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 model) for analyzing session transcripts. The system uses streaming responses and processes condensed transcripts that are already formatted as events (User, Assistant, Tool events). The extraction happens asynchronously via the MCP server daemon.
