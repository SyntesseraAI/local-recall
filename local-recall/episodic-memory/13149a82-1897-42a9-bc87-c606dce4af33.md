The memory extraction system in Local Recall uses Claude Haiku model to process transcripts and generate memories. It uses two-phase extraction:

1. **Keyword Extraction**: Initial pass to identify relevant keywords from transcript content
2. **Memory Generation**: Uses structured prompts (defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) to generate full memories with subject, keywords, and content

This approach allows for intelligent parsing of session transcripts to identify what knowledge should be persisted for future sessions.
