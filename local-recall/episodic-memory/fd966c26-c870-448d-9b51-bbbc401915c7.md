# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) where each line is a complete JSON object representing a transcript event.

## Implementation Details

The `transcript-collector.ts` module handles reading and parsing these transcripts. When collecting transcripts:
1. Construct the path by replacing slashes with dashes in the working directory
2. Read the `.jsonl` files from the transcripts directory
3. Parse each line as a separate JSON object
4. Process the events for memory extraction

## Relevance

This is crucial for the Stop hook and MCP server background daemon which need to locate and process transcripts to extract memories from AI-human interactions.
