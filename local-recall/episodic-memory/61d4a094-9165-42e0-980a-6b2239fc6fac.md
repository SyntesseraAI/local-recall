The session transcript provided appears to be incomplete or truncated. It only contains a partial message from the user indicating a 5-hour limit and reset time. There is no meaningful session activity, tool invocations, or code changes to analyze for memory extraction.

To properly extract memories:
- A complete transcript with actual user requests and assistant responses is needed
- Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.) should be visible
- Code changes or discoveries should be documented
- Project context and outcomes should be clear
