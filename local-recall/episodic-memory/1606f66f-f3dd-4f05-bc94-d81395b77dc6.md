Development requirements when working on Local Recall:

**Testing**:
- All new features require corresponding unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests go in `tests/integration/`
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases

**Documentation**:
- Documentation must be placed in `docs/` folder
- Update existing docs when modifying functionality
- CLAUDE.md serves as the main project documentation

This ensures code quality and helps future maintainers understand the system.
