# Transcript Event Structure

Each event in a Claude transcript `.jsonl` file contains:

- `model` - The Claude model used (e.g., "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")
- `stop_reason` - Why the response ended (e.g., "end_turn")
- `input_tokens` - Token count for the request
- `output_tokens` - Token count for the response
- `created_at` - ISO-8601 timestamp of when the event occurred
- Content fields vary by event type (messages, tool calls, etc.)

## Usage in Memory Extraction

This metadata is essential for:
- Determining which Claude model generated the conversation (for context)
- Tracking token usage and cost
- Sorting memories by temporal order (`occurred_at` field)
- Deduplicating memories based on timestamp patterns
- Understanding the conversation flow and decision-making context
