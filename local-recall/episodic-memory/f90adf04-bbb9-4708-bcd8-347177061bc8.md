The memory extraction system uses the RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction) algorithm to identify important phrases from transcripts. It filters keywords using POS (Part-of-Speech) tagging to prioritize nouns, verbs, and adjectives while excluding less meaningful words. This ensures extracted keywords are semantically relevant and useful for searching memories.
