The memory extraction prompts are defined in a separate file (memory-extraction.ts) rather than embedded in the extractor logic. This centralization allows for:

- Easy modification and improvement of extraction criteria
- Version control of prompt changes
- Consistent prompt structure across the codebase
- Separation of concerns between extraction logic and prompt design

The prompts guide Claude to extract memories based on:
1. What was learned
2. What is now known
3. What is specific to the codebase
4. What problems were solved

Following these categories helps ensure memories are relevant and actionable.
