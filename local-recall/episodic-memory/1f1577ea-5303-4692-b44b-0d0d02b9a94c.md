Several feature directions were identified as potential next work:

1. **CLI Tools** - Add `init`, `search`, `list`, `create` commands for direct memory management
2. **Memory Deduplication** - Detect and merge similar memories to reduce redundancy
3. **Memory Decay/Pruning** - Archive stale memories automatically over time
4. **Smarter Retrieval** - Context-aware memory loading based on current files being edited
5. **Improved Stop Hook** - Better automatic memory extraction from transcripts
6. **Live Testing** - Install plugin in real project to validate functionality

These represent potential optimization and feature expansion areas once core functionality is stable.
