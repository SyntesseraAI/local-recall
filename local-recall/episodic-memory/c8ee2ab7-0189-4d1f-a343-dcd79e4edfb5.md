# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The memory extraction process uses a special condensed format with `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` markers to identify sections that should be analyzed.

## Condensed Format

Transcripts are condensed into events with the following structure:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool calls

## Purpose

This structure helps identify:
- What was learned during the session
- Problems that were solved
- Codebase-specific knowledge and patterns
- Configuration and architectural decisions

The condensing process is implemented in the `transcript-collector.ts` module and reduces verbose transcripts into actionable segments for memory creation.
