# User Coding Style Preferences

The user prioritizes:
- **Minimal, focused implementations** - Only add what's explicitly requested or clearly necessary
- **Avoiding over-engineering** - Don't add extra features, refactoring, or "improvements" beyond the scope
- **Trusting existing code** - Don't add unnecessary error handling or validation for scenarios that can't happen
- **Simplicity over abstraction** - Three similar lines are better than premature abstractions
- **Efficiency in communication** - Short, concise responses and focused problem-solving

## Application

When working on this codebase:
- Don't add docstrings or comments to unchanged code
- Don't create helper utilities for one-time operations
- Don't design for hypothetical future requirements
- Focus on solving the immediate problem
- Clean up completely (don't keep unused `_vars` or `// removed` comments)
