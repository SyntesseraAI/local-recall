When extracting memories, prioritize specificity with file paths and function names, conciseness with one concept per memory, and actionability for future assistants. Use appropriate scope: `global` for architecture-wide knowledge, `file:<path>` for file-specific info, and `area:<name>` for component-related memories. Memories should help avoid mistakes or work more efficiently without including sensitive data or trivial information.
