Three hooks are configured via `.claude/settings.json`:

1. **SessionStart**: Loads 5 most recent memories (not using vector store to avoid slow initialization)
2. **UserPromptSubmit**: Performs semantic search using vector embeddings before Claude processes the prompt
3. **Stop**: Currently disabled - memory extraction handled asynchronously by MCP server daemon (every 5 minutes)

Hooks receive JSON input and output memory content to stdout for injection into Claude's context.
