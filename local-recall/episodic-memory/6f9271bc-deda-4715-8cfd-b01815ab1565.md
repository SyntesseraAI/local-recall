The `ensureGitignore()` function only created the gitignore file if it didn't exist, so existing files were never updated with new patterns. Since the gitignore is auto-generated, it should always be written to ensure new users get the correct patterns (e.g., memory.sqlite exclusion). Changed to unconditionally write the file every time.
