The BGE-small-en-v1.5 model is asymmetric, providing optimized embedding functions for different use cases. Passages (memories) are embedded using `passageEmbed()` which optimizes the embedding for being stored and retrieved, while queries are embedded using `queryEmbed()` which optimizes for matching against stored passages. This approach improves both the quality of memory representation and the quality of search results.
