## Memory File Structure and Extraction

Each memory file contains:

### Metadata (YAML frontmatter)
- `id`: Unique UUID identifier
- `subject`: One-line brief description (max 200 chars)
- `keywords`: Array of searchable keywords (lowercase, 1-10 items, specific)
- `applies_to`: Scope indicator:
  - `global` - Applies to entire codebase
  - `file:<path>` - Specific to one file
  - `area:<name>` - Related to a component/area
- `occurred_at`: ISO-8601 timestamp when event occurred
- `content_hash`: SHA-256 prefix (16 chars) of content for deduplication

### Content
- Detailed markdown content below the frontmatter
- Should explain the discovery, decision, or solution
- Include file paths, function names, and concrete details

### What Makes a Good Memory
- **Specific**: Includes file paths, function names, line numbers
- **Actionable**: Helps future assistants avoid mistakes or work efficiently
- **Focused**: One concept per memory
- **Not generic**: Not something Claude already knows
- **Not trivial**: Actually useful for future work

Memories should capture architectural decisions, bug fixes with root cause analysis, code patterns specific to the project, configuration quirks, and important component relationships.
