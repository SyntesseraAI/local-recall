The memory extraction system reads transcripts, condenses them, extracts keywords using Claude Haiku, and creates memory files with appropriate metadata (subject, keywords, applies_to scope, occurred_at, content_hash). The system is idempotent - duplicate memories are detected using occurred_at and content_hash to prevent duplicates.
