All development must follow these requirements:

- **Unit Tests**: Place in `tests/unit/` for isolated component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Place in `tests/integration/` for cross-component testing
- **Documentation**: Place in `docs/` folder
- **Coverage**: Tests must cover both happy paths and edge cases
- **Updates**: Modify existing documentation when changing functionality

Run tests with `npm test` (all), `npm run test:unit` (unit only), or `npm run test:integration` (integration only). The project enforces these standards to maintain code quality and maintainability.
