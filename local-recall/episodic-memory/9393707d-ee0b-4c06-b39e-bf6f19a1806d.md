# Claude Project Transcripts Storage

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name uses the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes and spaces replaced by underscores:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files where each line is a separate event:
- User messages
- Assistant responses
- Tool invocations
- Tool results

This is used by the MCP server daemon to process and extract memories asynchronously.
