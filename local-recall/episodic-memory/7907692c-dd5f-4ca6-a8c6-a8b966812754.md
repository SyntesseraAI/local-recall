When extracting memories, follow these guidelines:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Outdated information

Use appropriate scope: `global` for codebase-wide, `file:<path>` for file-specific, `area:<name>` for component-related.
