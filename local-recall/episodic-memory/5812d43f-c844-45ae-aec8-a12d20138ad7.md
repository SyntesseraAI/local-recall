The memory extraction system uses `claude -p --model haiku` to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. It uses a dedicated system prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and processes the transcript through the prompt to generate structured memories. The extraction is done asynchronously and can be called with a transcript path.
