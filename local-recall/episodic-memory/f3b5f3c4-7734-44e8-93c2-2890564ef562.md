The memory extraction process has well-defined guidelines:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

This filtering ensures memories remain actionable and long-lived.
