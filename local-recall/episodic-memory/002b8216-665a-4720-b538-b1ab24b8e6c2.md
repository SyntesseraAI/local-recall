Local Recall integrates with Claude Code through hooks configured in `hooks.json`:
- **SessionStart**: Loads 5 most recent memories at session start (full reload, avoids slow vector store init)
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Performs semantic search using vector embeddings when user submits a prompt
- **Stop**: Currently disabled; memory extraction is handled by MCP server daemon (runs every 5 minutes)

Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json` and receive JSON input via stdin.
