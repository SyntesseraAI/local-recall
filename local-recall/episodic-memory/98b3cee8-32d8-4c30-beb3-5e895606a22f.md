The Local Recall system includes a memory extraction component that analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to identify valuable memories for future assistants. This meta-process helps the system continuously improve by capturing:

- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations and optimizations

The extraction process filters out generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and trivial information, focusing only on actionable insights that help future work on the codebase.
