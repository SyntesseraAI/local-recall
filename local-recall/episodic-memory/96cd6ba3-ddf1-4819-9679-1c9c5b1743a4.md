# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Slashes (`/`) are replaced with dashes (`-`)
- The leading dash is removed
- Result: `~/.claude/projects/<project-name>/transcripts/`

Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## Transcript Files

Transcript files are JSONL format (one JSON object per line), stored in `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`.

This is important for the transcript-collector to locate and process transcripts for memory extraction.
