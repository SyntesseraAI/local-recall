The extraction prompt logic is separated from the memory-extractor.ts implementation into a dedicated prompts file. This separation allows:

1. Easy updates to extraction instructions without modifying core logic
2. Clear documentation of what constitutes valuable memories
3. Ability to version and test prompt variations independently
4. Better code organization and maintainability

The prompt provides structured guidelines about what to extract and what to avoid, including specific guidance about scope (global, file-specific, area-specific) and memory quality standards.
