Transcripts are condensed before being sent to the memory extraction process. This preprocessing step improves efficiency by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed by the Claude API while preserving the essential information needed for memory extraction.

This approach:
- Reduces API token usage and costs
- Speeds up memory extraction processing
- Maintains relevant information while removing noise
- Is part of the standard transcript processing pipeline
