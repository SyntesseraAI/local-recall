Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files stored locally in the repository. All memories are version-controllable and shareable among team members. The system uses a plugin architecture with hooks for SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, and Stop events, plus an MCP server for tool exposure.
