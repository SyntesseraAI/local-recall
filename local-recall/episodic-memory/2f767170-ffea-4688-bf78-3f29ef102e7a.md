Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system that allows Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions. It stores structured memories as versioned markdown files in local-recall/episodic-memory/ with YAML frontmatter metadata. The system includes hooks for SessionStart (load recent memories), UserPromptSubmit (semantic search), and a background MCP daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes to extract memories.
