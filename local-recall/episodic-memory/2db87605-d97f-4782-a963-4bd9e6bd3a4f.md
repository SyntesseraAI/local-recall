The SessionStart hook avoids lazy initialization of the vector store to prevent slow startup times. Instead, it:

1. Loads all memories from disk via `MemoryManager.listMemories()`
2. Returns the 5 most recent memories sorted by `occurred_at`
3. Outputs memory content to stdout (injected into Claude's context)

This is a full reload (not incremental) approach optimized for fast session initialization.
