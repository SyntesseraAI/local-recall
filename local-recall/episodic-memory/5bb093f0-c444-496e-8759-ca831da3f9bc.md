Claude stores transcript .jsonl files directly in ~/.claude/projects/<project-name>/ directory, not in a transcripts/ subfolder. The listSourceTranscripts method should look for *.jsonl files directly in the project directory. This was discovered when debugging why the transcript collector found 230 transcripts after fixing the path lookup logic.
