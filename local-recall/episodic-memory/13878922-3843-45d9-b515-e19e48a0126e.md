# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

Each transcript is stored as a JSONL file with a timestamp-based filename.

## Relevance

This is important for the transcript-collector component which needs to read and parse Claude's project transcripts to extract memories. The path conversion is critical for locating the correct transcript files.
