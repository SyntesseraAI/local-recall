Memory extraction uses a centralized prompt template defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts. This prompt:

- Provides instructions for extracting memories from transcripts
- Includes guidelines for determining keywords, subjects, and scope
- Handles transcript consolidation and memory creation
- Is imported and used by memory-extractor.ts for consistent behavior

Keeping the prompt centralized allows easy updates to extraction logic without modifying the extractor code.
