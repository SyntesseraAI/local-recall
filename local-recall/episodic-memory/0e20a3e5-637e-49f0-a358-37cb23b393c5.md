The memory extraction process analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to identify valuable learnings that help future AI assistants. Key principles:

- Extract architectural decisions and reasoning
- Include specific file paths and function names
- Focus on codebase-specific patterns and conventions
- Document bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Use appropriate scope (global, file:<path>, area:<name>)
- Avoid generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, or sensitive data

This enables knowledge accumulation across sessions and improves future assistant effectiveness on the codebase.
