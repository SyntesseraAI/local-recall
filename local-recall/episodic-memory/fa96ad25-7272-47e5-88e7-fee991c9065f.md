The system includes transcript condensing functionality that converts verbose Claude Code session transcripts into a compact event-based format:

- `[User]` events capture user requests
- `[Assistant]` events capture Claude's responses
- `[Tool: Name]` events capture tool invocations
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` events capture outcomes

This condensed format:
1. Reduces storage and processing overhead
2. Makes transcripts easier for Claude to analyze for memory extraction
3. Focuses on actionable information rather than verbose conversations
4. Improves efficiency of memory-based context injection

Implementation uses transcript-collector module to handle the condensing process.
