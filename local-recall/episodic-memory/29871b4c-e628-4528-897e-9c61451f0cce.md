# Memory Extraction from Transcripts

Memory extraction from transcripts works by processing the full transcript content directly.

## Process

1. Transcripts are decoded from BASE64 format (handled by transcript-collector)
2. Full decoded content is passed to the memory extraction process
3. No separate compression/condensation layer is needed - the full transcript context is available
4. Claude processes the transcript to extract relevant memories

## Key Insight

The transcript-condenser utility mentioned in the architecture documentation is separate and may be used for other purposes, but the core memory extraction workflow uses the full transcript content directly for better context and accuracy.
