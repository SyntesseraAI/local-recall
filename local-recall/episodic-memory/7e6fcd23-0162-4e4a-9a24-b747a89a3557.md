Implemented transcript condensing to improve memory extraction quality and performance. The system now uses `claude -p --model haiku` to summarize long transcripts into condensed versions before memory extraction. This reduces noise, improves relevance of extracted memories, and handles edge cases where transcripts are too long for the MCP server to process efficiently.
