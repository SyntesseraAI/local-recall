# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with `.jsonl` extension, where each line is a complete JSON object representing an event in the conversation.

## Relevance to Local Recall

The MCP server daemon needs to sync and process transcripts from this location to extract memories for the local-recall project.
