Standardized string quotes throughout the codebase to use single quotes and improved logging consistency in the user-prompt-submit hook. This includes better formatting of log messages and consistent use of quotes in hook implementations. The user-prompt-submit hook is responsible for searching memories based on user prompts before Claude processes them.
