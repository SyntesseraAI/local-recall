The memory extraction logic relies on a dedicated prompts module (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) that contains the system prompt instructing Claude on how to extract memories. This separation of concerns keeps extraction instructions separate from the extraction logic, making prompts easier to iterate on and test.
