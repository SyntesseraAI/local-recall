The memory extraction process uses Claude Haiku (via `claude -p` command) to intelligently extract keywords and generate memory content from transcripts. The system uses a multi-step prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides the model to identify key concepts and create concise, actionable memory entries. This approach is more flexible than regex-based parsing and can handle complex, context-dependent content.
