# MCP Server Background Processing

The MCP server runs a background daemon that:
1. Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
2. Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
3. Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
4. Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
5. Runs every 5 minutes

This is why the Stop hook is currently disabled - memory extraction happens asynchronously via the MCP daemon instead of synchronously during session stop.
