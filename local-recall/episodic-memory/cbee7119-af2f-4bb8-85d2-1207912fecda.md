Local Recall is a persistent memory layer for Claude Code and other AI tools that enables storing and retrieving contextual information about codebases across sessions. All memories are stored locally as markdown files with YAML frontmatter, making them version-controllable and shareable.

**Key Architecture Components:**
- Memory Manager: CRD operations for memory files (no update - idempotent)
- Vector Store: SQLite-backed with fastembed embeddings for semantic search
- Claude Code Integration: Three hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop)
- MCP Server: Exposes memory tools to compatible clients

**Memory File Format:**
Markdown with YAML frontmatter containing: id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash

**Hooks:**
- SessionStart: Loads 5 most recent memories
- UserPromptSubmit: Performs semantic search based on user prompt
- Stop: Disabled - MCP server processes transcripts every 5 minutes instead
