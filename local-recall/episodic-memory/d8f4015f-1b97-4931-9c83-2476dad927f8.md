# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with names like `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.jsonl` where the timestamp is the session start time.

Each line in the JSONL file is a JSON object representing an event in the session:
- User messages
- Assistant responses
- Tool invocations
- Transcript metadata

## Usage Context

The `transcript-collector` module needs to read these transcripts to extract memories. This location is critical for the MCP daemon background task that syncs transcripts every 5 minutes.

## Important Notes

- Transcripts are stored in the Claude cache directory, not in the project repo
- The path format is consistent across all projects on a given machine
- This information is essential for implementing transcript syncing in the memory extraction process
