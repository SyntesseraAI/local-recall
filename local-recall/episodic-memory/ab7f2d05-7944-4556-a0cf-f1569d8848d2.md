The project migrated from storing vector indexes as JSON files (`orama-episodic-index.json`, `orama-thinking-index.json`) to using SQLite with vector embeddings. The new `src/core/vector-store.ts` uses SQLite with a vector search extension for semantic similarity searches. Index files are no longer used; instead, data is persisted in a SQLite database with separate tables for memories and embeddings.
