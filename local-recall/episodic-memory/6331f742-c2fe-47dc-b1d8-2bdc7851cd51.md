# Transcript Condensing Process

Transcript condensing is a preprocessing step that simplifies raw transcripts before memory extraction.

## Purpose

Condensing transforms verbose transcripts into a compact format that:
- Removes unnecessary detail and noise
- Preserves essential information about what happened
- Makes transcripts suitable for memory extraction
- Reduces input size for Claude's memory extraction model

## Process Flow

1. Read raw transcript files (JSONL format)
2. Condense/simplify the transcript
3. Pass condensed transcript to memory extraction logic

## Implementation Details

The transcript condensing functionality is implemented in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`.

## Usage in Memory Extraction

When extracting memories from a transcript:
1. Load the transcript from `~/.claude/projects/<project-name>/transcripts/`
2. Condense it using the transcript-collector module
3. Pass condensed output to memory extraction

This preprocessing step is important for efficiency and quality of memory extraction.
