Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`. All memories are version-controlled in git, allowing them to be shared among team members. The system provides a persistent memory layer for codebase context and project-specific information.
