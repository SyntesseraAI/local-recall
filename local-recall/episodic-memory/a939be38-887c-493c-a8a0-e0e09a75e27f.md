The `processed-log.json` file (or `.jsonl` variant) is critical for the transcript processing pipeline. It tracks:

1. Which transcripts have already been processed
2. Content hashes to detect when transcripts change
3. Prevents duplicate memory extraction from the same transcript

This file should be added to `.gitignore` to prevent:
- Merge conflicts when multiple sessions process transcripts
- False change detection from processing state updates
- Git bloat from frequent updates

The processed-log is used by the MCP server daemon (runs every 5 minutes) to determine which transcripts need processing.
