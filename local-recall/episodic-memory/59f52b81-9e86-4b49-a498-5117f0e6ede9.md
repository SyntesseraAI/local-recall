The session-start hook doesn't need explicit .gitignore creation logic because IndexManager handles it automatically. When the hook calls `searchEngine.getRelevantForSession()` during session initialization, it triggers `indexManager.getIndex()` which ensures the .gitignore file exists. This is a clean separation of concerns where the index manager owns responsibility for maintaining the directory structure and configuration files needed for the memory system to function.
