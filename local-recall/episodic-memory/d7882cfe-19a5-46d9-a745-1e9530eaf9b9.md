# Embedding Model Configuration

Local Recall uses **BGE-small-en-v1.5** from the `fastembed` library for semantic search.

## Model Details

- **Model ID**: `bge-small-en-v1.5`
- **Size**: ~133MB
- **Library**: `fastembed` (pure Python implementation)
- **Cache Location**: `local_cache/` directory

## First Run Behavior

- Initial startup: 30-60 seconds (model download)
- Subsequent runs: Fast (loads from cache)
- Model is automatically downloaded on first use

## Cache Management

If the embedding model cache becomes corrupted:
1. Remove: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*`
2. The model will re-download automatically on next run

This model was chosen for its balance of performance and model size, making it suitable for local development and deployment.
