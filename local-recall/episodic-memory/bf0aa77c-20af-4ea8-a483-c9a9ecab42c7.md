The `stripMarkdownCodeBlocks()` method in memory-extractor.ts is used to clean transcript text by removing markdown code blocks. This is a utility function that processes text during transcript analysis for memory extraction, indicating that transcripts may contain markdown-formatted code blocks that need to be handled carefully when extracting memories.
