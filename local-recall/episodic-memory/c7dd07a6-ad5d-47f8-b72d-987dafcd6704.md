Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/<project-id>/transcripts/` on macOS. These transcripts are cached locally and can be synced by the MCP server or local-recall daemon for memory extraction and processing. The project ID is a unique identifier generated by Claude for each project.
