The memory extraction pipeline includes a transcript condensing step before processing. This suggests:

- Raw transcripts are condensed into events before being sent to Claude for analysis
- Condensing likely reduces token usage and focuses on relevant information
- The condensed format includes [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], and [Result] event types
- This preprocessing helps extract more meaningful memories from lengthy session transcripts
