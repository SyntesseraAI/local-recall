# Claude Project Transcripts Storage

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Structure

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes, prefixed with `project-`. For example:
- Project path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder name: `project-users-joe-code-syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/project-users-joe-code-syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory. Each line is a JSON object representing a single message or event in the conversation.

## Key Paths

- Claude cache: `~/.claude/`
- Projects directory: `~/.claude/projects/`
- Transcripts for a project: `~/.claude/projects/project-<encoded-path>/transcripts/`

This information is useful for the MCP server daemon that needs to sync transcripts and process them for memory extraction.
