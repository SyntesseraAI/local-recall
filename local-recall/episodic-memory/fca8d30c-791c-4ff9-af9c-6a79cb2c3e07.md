# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) files, with each line being a separate JSON object representing a tool use, tool result, or assistant message.

## Key Details

- The folder structure uses dashes to replace all slashes in the absolute path
- Multiple transcripts can exist for the same project (one per session)
- Transcripts include both user interactions and tool invocations
- The format is JSONL (one JSON object per line) rather than a single JSON file
