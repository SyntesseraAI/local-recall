When running local-recall in a new repository, transcripts may not be found. Added INFO-level logging to `transcript-collector.ts` to show:

1. When starting the search for Claude project transcripts
2. The project path being searched
3. The Claude projects directory location (~/.claude/projects)
4. The expected folder name based on the path
5. Whether the directory exists
6. How many transcripts were discovered
7. Sync summary showing created/updated/deleted transcript counts

This helps users debug why transcripts aren't being copied in new repos. The logs are written to `local-recall/recall.log` at INFO level and above.

Key logging points added:
- `findSourceTranscripts()` method: logs search paths and directory existence checks
- `syncTranscripts()` method: logs sync results and summary statistics

This is critical for troubleshooting transcript collection issues in new project setups.
