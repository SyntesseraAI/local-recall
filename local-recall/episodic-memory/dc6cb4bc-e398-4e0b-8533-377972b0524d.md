Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use. First run may take 30-60 seconds while the model downloads, but subsequent runs load from cache. If the tokenizer file is not found error occurs, it indicates corrupted cache and can be fixed by removing `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to allow re-download on next run.
