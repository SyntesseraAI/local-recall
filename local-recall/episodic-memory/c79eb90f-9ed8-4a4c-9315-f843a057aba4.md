# Keywords Extraction as Part of Memory Workflow

The user is working with transcript analysis as part of the memory extraction system. They're testing or implementing keyword extraction from condensed transcripts.

## Key Insight
The workflow involves:
1. Getting a condensed transcript
2. Extracting keywords from the transcript text
3. Using those keywords for memory search and memory creation

This suggests the memory extraction pipeline should handle both:
- Automatic keyword extraction from user prompts (already in user-prompt-submit hook)
- Keyword extraction from session transcripts (for memory creation from completed sessions)

Both should return clean JSON arrays of keywords for downstream processing.
