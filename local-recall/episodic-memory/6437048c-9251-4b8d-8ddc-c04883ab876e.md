# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

Work started on implementing transcript condensing to improve memory extraction efficiency.

## Context

Raw transcripts from Claude Code contain verbose event logs that include:
- Full tool invocation details
- Complete command outputs
- Long assistant explanations

This leads to:
- Higher token usage when processing transcripts
- Less efficient memory extraction
- Larger prompt sizes when sending to Claude for analysis

## Solution

Implementing a condense step in `transcript-collector.ts` that:
1. Parses raw transcript JSONL events
2. Summarizes verbose events (keeping key information)
3. Reduces output size while preserving semantic content
4. Passes condensed transcript to memory extraction pipeline

## Implementation Details

The condenser should maintain:
- User intents and requests
- Tool names and results (condensed outputs)
- Key decisions and learnings
- Error messages and resolutions

Remove or abbreviate:
- Full command outputs (keep only status)
- Verbose explanations (keep summaries)
- Intermediate debugging steps
- Repetitive information
