# Condensed Transcript Format for Memory Extraction

The memory extraction process uses a standardized, condensed transcript format to make analysis more efficient.

## Event Types

- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool calls

## Purpose

This structured format helps identify:
- What was learned during the session
- Problems that were solved
- Code patterns discovered
- Architecture decisions made
- User preferences

## Usage in local-recall

The condensed format is used by:
1. The MCP server daemon when processing transcripts
2. The memory extraction analysis phase (marked by `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]`)
3. Tools that parse and analyze session history

This format balances detail with efficiency, making it suitable for both human review and AI analysis.
