Added comprehensive tests for field name normalization in the memory extractor test suite (lines 224-277). Test cases cover:

1. Alternative field names (summary, title, tags, scope, description, body)
2. Mixed valid and invalid field names in same memory object
3. Normalized fields pass Zod validation after normalization
4. Original fields remain if no alternatives present

Tests ensure the normalization logic handles Claude's field name variations gracefully. All 228 tests pass.
