# Current Refactoring Status

The local-recall project is currently on an active refactoring branch: `claude/refactor-memory-collection-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`

The refactoring includes:
- Changes to memory collection system
- Standardization of string quotes and logging consistency
- Renaming of memories directory from `memories` to `episodic-memory`
- Transcript condensing for memory extraction
- Various core module improvements

## Key Changes
- Deletion of `src/core/index.ts` (file was deleted in refactoring)
- Addition of new modules: `src/core/embedding.ts` and `src/core/vector-store.ts`
- Multiple modifications to core memory management files

When working on this branch or merging to main, be aware these significant changes are in progress.
