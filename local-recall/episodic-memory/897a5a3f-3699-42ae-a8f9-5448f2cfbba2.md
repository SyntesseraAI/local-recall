Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. On first run, the model automatically downloads and caches in `local_cache/`. Subsequent runs load from cache. If a 'Tokenizer file not found' error occurs, remove `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to force re-download.
