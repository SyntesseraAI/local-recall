Memory extraction from transcripts is handled asynchronously by the MCP server daemon which runs every 5 minutes, not by the Stop hook. The daemon:
1. Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/)
2. Processes transcripts using claude -p to extract memories
3. Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
4. Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change

The Stop hook is currently disabled.
