Claude Code stores project transcript files in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The project folder naming convention uses URL-encoded paths: `/Users/joe/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/` for the local-recall project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`.

Transcript files are JSONL format (`.jsonl` extension) and are organized by session. This location is critical for the MCP server's background daemon that syncs and processes transcripts asynchronously.
