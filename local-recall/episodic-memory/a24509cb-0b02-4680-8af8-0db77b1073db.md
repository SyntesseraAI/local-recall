# Claude Code Transcript Format

Claude Code stores transcripts as JSONL (JSON Lines) format, with each line representing a discrete event.

## Event Types

Transcripts contain various event types:
- User messages/prompts
- Assistant responses
- Tool invocations (e.g., Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep)
- Tool results (success/error outcomes)
- Session metadata (session_id, timestamps)

Each line is a separate JSON object that can be independently parsed and processed.
