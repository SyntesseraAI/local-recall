Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. Memory files are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` with YAML frontmatter containing: id (UUID), subject, keywords, applies_to (scope), occurred_at (ISO-8601), and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix). The applies_to field can be 'global', 'file:<path>', or 'area:<name>' to scope memories. Memory files are version-controlled in git.
