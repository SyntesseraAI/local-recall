The extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` defines clear guidelines for what should and should not be extracted:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations and optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

Memories must use appropriate scope (`global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`) and be specific, concise, and actionable.
