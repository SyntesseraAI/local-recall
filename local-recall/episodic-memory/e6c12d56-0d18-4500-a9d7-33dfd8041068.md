Memory extraction logic is guided by a structured prompt system stored in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts. This centralized approach allows for easy maintenance and iteration on the extraction criteria without modifying the core extractor logic. The prompt likely specifies what constitutes a valuable memory and how to format the output JSON.
