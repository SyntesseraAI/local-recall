Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools via MCP to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. All memories are stored locally in the repository (version-controlled) in local-recall/episodic-memory/ directory. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings (fastembed, BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic search. Key components include memory manager (CRUD ops), vector store (semantic search), and MCP server for tool exposure.
