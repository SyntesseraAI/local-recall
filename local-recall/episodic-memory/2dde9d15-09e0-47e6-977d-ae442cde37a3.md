The project build and test suite are functional and passing after the thinking memory enhancements:

- `npm run build` compiles TypeScript successfully
- `npm test` runs the test suite with all tests passing
- Changes made to thinking extractor, user-prompt-submit-thinking hook, config, and types did not introduce regressions

This validates that the token-based retrieval and combined thought+output features are working correctly.
