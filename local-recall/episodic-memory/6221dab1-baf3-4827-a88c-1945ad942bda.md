Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system that allows Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. All memories are stored locally in the repository making them version-controllable and shareable. The system includes hooks for SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, and Stop events, plus an MCP server for exposing memory tools.
