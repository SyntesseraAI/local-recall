The memory extraction process uses the Claude API (via Anthropic SDK) to analyze transcripts and generate structured memories. The extraction is controlled by a detailed system prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides Claude on what constitutes valuable memories and how to format them. This ensures consistent, high-quality memory extraction across sessions.
