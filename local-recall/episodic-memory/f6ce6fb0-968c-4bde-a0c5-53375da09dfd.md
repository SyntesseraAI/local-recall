# Keyword Extraction for Memory Search

## Importance in Local Recall System

Keywords are critical metadata for memory search because they:
1. Support semantic similarity search through vector embeddings
2. Help AI assistants understand the memory's scope and application
3. Enable better ranking and filtering of search results
4. Improve discoverability of related memories

## Best Practices for Keywords

- Use 1-10 specific, lowercase keywords per memory
- Keywords should represent the core concepts and context
- Include technical terms, function names, file paths when relevant
- Use consistent terminology across related memories
- Keywords feed into the embedding model for semantic search

## When Extracting Keywords

- Focus on the most important aspects of the memory
- Include domain-specific terminology
- Add actionable terms that future assistants might search for
- Avoid generic keywords that appear in many memories
