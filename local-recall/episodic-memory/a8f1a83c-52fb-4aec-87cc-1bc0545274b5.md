# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:

- Path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `users-joe-code-syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/users-joe-code-syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line) where each line represents a message or tool invocation in the conversation.

## Key Fields in Transcripts

Each line typically contains:
- `role` - Either 'user' or 'assistant'
- `content` - The message text or tool call details
- `timestamp` - When the event occurred

This format is useful for analyzing conversation history and extracting memories about what was discussed and decided during sessions.
