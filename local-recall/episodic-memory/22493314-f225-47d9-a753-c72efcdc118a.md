# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is created by taking the absolute working directory path and replacing slashes with dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- The transcript files are stored in `~/.claude/projects/{converted-path}/transcripts/`
- Transcript files are named with ISO 8601 timestamps and have `.jsonl` extension

This path conversion is important for the transcript-collector to correctly locate and process Claude's session transcripts.
