Local Recall integrates with Claude Code through hooks configured in `hooks.json`. Three hook types exist: SessionStart (loads 5 most recent memories on session begin), UserPromptSubmit (performs semantic search on user prompts), and Stop (disabled, replaced by MCP server daemon). Hooks are shell commands that receive JSON input via stdin and output memory content to stdout.
