The memory extraction system processes transcripts in a condensed format with structured event markers:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude responses or explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool executions

This condensed format allows the extraction system to efficiently analyze session activity and identify valuable memories.
