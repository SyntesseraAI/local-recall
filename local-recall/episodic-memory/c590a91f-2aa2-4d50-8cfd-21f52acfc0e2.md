The memory extraction system in memory-extractor.ts uses the Claude API with streaming enabled to process transcripts efficiently. Streaming allows for better token management and real-time processing of memory extraction results. The system leverages prompt templates from memory-extraction.ts to guide Claude in extracting structured memories from transcripts.
