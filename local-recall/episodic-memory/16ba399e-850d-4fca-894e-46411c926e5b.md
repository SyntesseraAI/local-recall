The MemoryExtractor class in src/core/memory-extractor.ts (lines 1-478) handles the core logic of extracting memories from session transcripts. It uses the Claude API to analyze transcript content and extract structured memories. Key responsibilities include:

- Processing transcript files and extracting relevant memories
- Using Claude's language understanding to identify key concepts and learnings
- Creating properly formatted memory objects with metadata
- Handling batch processing of transcripts

The extractor integrates with the memory creation system to persist extracted memories as markdown files in the episodic-memory directory.
