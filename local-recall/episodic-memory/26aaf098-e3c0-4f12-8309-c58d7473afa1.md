# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Naming Convention

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path by replacing path separators with underscores and removing special characters. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`
- Transcripts stored in: `~/.claude/projects/Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) with naming pattern `transcript-<timestamp>.jsonl`.

This is important for the MCP server and transcript collector functionality, as they need to locate and process these transcript files to extract memories.
