Added test suite for field name normalization in memory extractor (lines 129-276). Tests cover:

1. Basic field name aliases (title→subject, tags→keywords, scope→applies_to, body→content)
2. Mixed aliases in single memory object
3. Nested memories array with aliases
4. Partial field normalization (some fields present, others absent)
5. Graceful handling of null/undefined values after normalization

These tests ensure the normalization logic correctly handles various Claude response formats without losing data or causing validation failures. All 228 tests pass.
