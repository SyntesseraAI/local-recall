# Fuzzy Search Threshold

## Configuration

The fuzzy search threshold is set to **0.6** by default (60% match confidence).

This means keywords must match at least 60% to be considered a match in `searchByKeywords()`.

## Behavior

- **Score >= 0.6**: Keyword is included in search results
- **Score < 0.6**: Keyword is filtered out

## Location

Configurable via environment variable or `.local-recall.json` file in the `fuzzyThreshold` setting.

## Relevance

This is important for tuning search precision vs recall. Lower threshold = more matches but potentially noisier. Higher threshold = fewer matches but more relevant.
