The memory extraction prompt in memory-extraction.ts uses Claude's structured output feature to enforce a specific JSON schema for extracted memories. The prompt instructs Claude to extract memories as an array of objects with fields: subject, keywords, applies_to, and content. This ensures consistent, parseable memory objects that can be directly processed by the memory creation system.
