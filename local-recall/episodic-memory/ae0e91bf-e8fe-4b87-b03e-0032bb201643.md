Local Recall is a local markdown-powered memory system that allows Claude Code and other AI tools (via MCP) to retain information and context across sessions. Memories are stored as structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory and are version-controlled in git. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings for semantic search using the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model via fastembed library.
