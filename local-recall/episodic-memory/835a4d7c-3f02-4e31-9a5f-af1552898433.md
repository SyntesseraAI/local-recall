# Transcript Condensing Format

When condensing transcripts for memory extraction analysis, use the following event format:

- `[User]` - What the user asked or requested
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude said or explained
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This condensed format provides enough context for the memory extraction process while remaining concise and focused on the relevant interactions and outcomes.
