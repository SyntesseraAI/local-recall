The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Anthropic Claude API (via @anthropic-ai/sdk) to process session transcripts. It sends condensed transcripts to Claude for analysis to extract valuable memories. The extractor handles:
- Reading and condensing transcripts from Claude's cache
- Calling Claude API with structured prompts to extract memories
- Creating memory files with extracted metadata
- Managing API errors and retries

Key file: `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` contains the prompt used for memory extraction.
