The memory extraction logic uses a dedicated prompt file at `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that contains the instructions for Claude Haiku to extract memories. This separation allows the extraction logic to be maintained independently from the extraction mechanism.

The prompt file contains detailed guidelines for what constitutes a valid memory, how to scope memories appropriately, and what should or should not be extracted from transcripts.
