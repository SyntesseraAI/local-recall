Project has explicit development requirements:

- All new features must have corresponding unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests go in `tests/integration/`
- Documentation must be placed in `docs/` folder
- Update existing docs when modifying functionality
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases

Build and test scripts:
- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript
- `npm test` - Run all tests
- `npm run test:unit` - Unit tests only
- `npm run test:integration` - Integration tests
- `npm run lint` - Lint code
- `npm run dev` - Watch mode
- `npm run mcp:start` - Start MCP server
