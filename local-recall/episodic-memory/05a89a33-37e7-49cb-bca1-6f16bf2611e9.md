# Memory Extraction Guidelines

## What to Extract

- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to this project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations or optimizations

## What NOT to Extract

- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Key Principles

- Be specific: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- Be concise: One concept per memory
- Be actionable: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work efficiently
- Use appropriate scope: `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`
