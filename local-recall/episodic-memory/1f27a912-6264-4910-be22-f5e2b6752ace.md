The project implements semantic search capabilities using the fastembed library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model. This model is approximately 133MB and is automatically downloaded and cached in `local_cache/` on first use. The vector store implementation allows for semantic similarity searching in addition to keyword-based fuzzy search, enabling more intelligent memory retrieval based on meaning rather than just keyword matching.
