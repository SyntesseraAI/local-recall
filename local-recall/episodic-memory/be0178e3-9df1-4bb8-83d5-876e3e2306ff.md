The VectorStore implements semantic search with specific scoring behavior:

- **Score Range**: 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (identical)
- **Scoring Method**: Cosine distance similarity
- **Score Precision**: Rounded to 2 decimal places (e.g., 0.65)
- **Primary Sort**: Results sorted by similarity score descending
- **Tie-Breaker**: When scores are equal, more recent memories (`occurred_at`) are ranked first

This ensures that semantically similar memories are surfaced first, with recency as a secondary ranking factor for equally relevant memories.
