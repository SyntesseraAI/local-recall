Based on the extraction guidelines in memory-extractor.ts, the system prioritizes extracting:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

The system explicitly excludes generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, sensitive data, and quickly-outdating information.
