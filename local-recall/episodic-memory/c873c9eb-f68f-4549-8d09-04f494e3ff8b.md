# Memory Extraction Guidelines

## What to Extract

Focus on information that will help future AI assistants:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations

## What NOT to Extract

- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that will become outdated quickly

## Memory Requirements

Memories must be:
- **Specific**: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- **Concise**: One concept or discovery per memory
- **Actionable**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work efficiently
- **Properly scoped**: Use `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>` appropriately
