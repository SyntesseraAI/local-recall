The 'applies_to' field in memory files determines scope: 'global' for codebase-wide knowledge, 'file:<path>' for file-specific details, and 'area:<name>' for component-based memories. This scoping mechanism allows memories to be precisely targeted, improving relevance when memories are retrieved during future sessions. The system uses this scope information to filter and prioritize memories based on current context.
