# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by underscores and a suffix added.

For example:
- Working dir: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder name: `_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall_01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall_01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with names like `transcript_2024-12-01_10-30-45.jsonl`.

Each line is a JSON object representing a single event in the transcript, including tool invocations and results.
