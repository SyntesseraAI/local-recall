The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. It sends transcripts to Claude with a structured prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides the model to identify and extract memories with specific fields (subject, keywords, applies_to, content). This is used by the MCP server daemon to asynchronously process transcripts every 5 minutes.
