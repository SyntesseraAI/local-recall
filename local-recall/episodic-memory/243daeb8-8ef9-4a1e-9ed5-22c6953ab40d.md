# TypeScript Configuration for local-recall

The project uses TypeScript 5.9+ with specific configuration requirements:

## Key tsconfig.json Settings

- **Module Resolution**: Should support both CommonJS and ES modules
- **Output Target**: ES2020 or higher for modern async/await support
- **Build Output**: Compiled JavaScript goes to `dist/` directory
- **Type Declarations**: Should generate `*.d.ts` files for published packages

## Build Process

- `npm run build` compiles TypeScript to `dist/`
- Scripts are bundled from `src/` to `scripts/` for plugin execution
- Both hook scripts and MCP server are bundled as standalone JavaScript files

## Development

- `npm run dev` runs TypeScript in watch mode during development
- Source files use `.ts` extension
- Tests use `.test.ts` extension
- Output artifacts should be committed to `scripts/` but not source TypeScript files
