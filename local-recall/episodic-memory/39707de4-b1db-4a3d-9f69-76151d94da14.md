The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude Haiku model to process transcripts and extract valuable memories. This is part of the MCP server's background daemon that asynchronously processes transcripts every 5 minutes.

The extraction leverages the prompt defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide the model in identifying and structuring memories from the transcript content.
