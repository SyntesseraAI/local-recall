The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API (Anthropic SDK) with streaming to process transcripts. It streams the response from Claude to extract memories efficiently without waiting for the full response. The extraction prompt is defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`.
