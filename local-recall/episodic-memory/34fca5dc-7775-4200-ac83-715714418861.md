Added two environment variables to control memory systems:

- `LOCAL_RECALL_EPISODIC_ENABLED` (default: `false`) - Controls episodic memory search, session-start retrieval, and extraction/processing
- `LOCAL_RECALL_THINKING_ENABLED` (default: `true`) - Controls thinking memory search and extraction/processing

These flags were added to:
- `src/core/types.ts` - Config interface (lines 118-119)
- `src/utils/config.ts` - Environment variable parsing (lines 56-61)
- All hooks and MCP server were updated to check these flags before enabling/disabling features
