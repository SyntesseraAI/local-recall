Transcripts are condensed into events:
- `[User]` - User queries and requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool outcomes

This condensed format is used for memory extraction prompts and is more efficient than raw transcripts for analysis.
