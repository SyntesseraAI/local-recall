## Discovery
When analyzing transcripts to filter for thinking content, thinking blocks in Claude transcripts are structured as JSON content blocks with a `"type":"thinking"` field.

## Details
- Transcripts contain content arrays with multiple blocks
- Each block is a JSON object with properties including `type`
- Thinking blocks specifically have `type: "thinking"`
- This is consistent with how the thinking-extractor.ts identifies and processes thinking blocks
- Non-thinking transcripts (like Haiku models) will have no blocks with `type: "thinking"`

## Usage
This pattern is used throughout the codebase to:
- Identify whether a transcript contains thinking
- Extract thinking blocks from transcripts
- Filter transcripts during sync and cleanup operations
