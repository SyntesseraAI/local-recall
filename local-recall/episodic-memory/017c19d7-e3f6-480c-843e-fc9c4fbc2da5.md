The SessionStart hook (`src/hooks/session-start.ts`) is triggered when a Claude Code session begins. It loads the 5 most recent memories by `occurred_at` timestamp sorted in reverse order.

**Important**: This hook does NOT use the vector store. Full disk-based loading is used instead to avoid slow initialization times on every session start. This is a performance optimization - the vector store is only initialized lazily in the UserPromptSubmit hook.
