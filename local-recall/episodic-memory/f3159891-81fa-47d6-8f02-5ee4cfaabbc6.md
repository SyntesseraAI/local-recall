The memory extraction system follows a two-phase approach:
1. **Condensing Phase**: Raw transcripts are condensed to remove verbosity while preserving key events and decisions
2. **Extraction Phase**: Condensed transcript is fed to Claude Haiku with a structured prompt to identify and extract actionable memories

This separation of concerns improves both performance and memory quality by focusing extraction on distilled, relevant content.
