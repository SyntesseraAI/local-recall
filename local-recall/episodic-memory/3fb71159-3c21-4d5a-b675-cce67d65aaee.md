# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by hyphens and a hash appended for uniqueness. For example:

- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with timestamps:
- Filename format: `transcript_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jsonl`
- Each line is a JSON object representing a transcript event
- Transcripts include user prompts, assistant responses, and tool invocations

This path convention is important for the transcript-collector feature which needs to locate and parse project transcripts.
