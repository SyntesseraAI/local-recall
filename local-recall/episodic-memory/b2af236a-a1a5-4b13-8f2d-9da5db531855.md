The core memory system is split into several components in `src/core/`:
- `memory.ts`: CRD operations (Create, Read, Delete - no update as memories are idempotent)
- `vector-store.ts`: SQLite + sqlite-vec extension for semantic similarity search using cosine distance (0.0-1.0 scores, rounded to 2 decimals)
- `embedding.ts`: Generates embeddings using fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model
- `search.ts`: Implements semantic search using the vector store
- `processed-log.ts`: Tracks which transcripts have been processed for change detection

Search results are ranked by cosine similarity score, with recent memories as tie-breakers when scores are equal.
