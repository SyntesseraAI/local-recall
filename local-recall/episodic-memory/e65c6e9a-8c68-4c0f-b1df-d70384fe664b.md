The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku model via `claude -p` command for processing transcripts. This choice is intentional for cost optimization - Haiku is significantly cheaper than larger models while still being capable of extracting meaningful memories from session transcripts. The extraction happens asynchronously in the MCP server daemon which processes transcripts every 5 minutes.
