The MCP server handles memory extraction and processing with the ability to disable either memory type:

- Episodic extraction can be disabled with `LOCAL_RECALL_EPISODIC_ENABLED`
- Thinking extraction can be disabled with `LOCAL_RECALL_THINKING_ENABLED`
- The background daemon respects these flags to avoid processing disabled memory types
- This allows users to opt-in/out of different memory systems without deleting existing memories
