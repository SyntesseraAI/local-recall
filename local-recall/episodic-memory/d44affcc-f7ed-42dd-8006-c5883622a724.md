The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku (via `claude -p --model haiku`) to analyze transcripts and extract memories. The extraction uses a detailed prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that instructs Claude to identify and structure memories from session transcripts. This approach ensures consistent, high-quality memory extraction across different sessions and contexts.
