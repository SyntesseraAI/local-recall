Local Recall uses `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. The model is cached in `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` directory. First initialization downloads the model (30-60 seconds), subsequent runs load from cache. Similarity scores range 0.0-1.0 using cosine distance, with recency as tie-breaker when scores are equal.
