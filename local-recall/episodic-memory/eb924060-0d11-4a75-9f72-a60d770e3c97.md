The memory extraction process condenses transcripts before sending them to Claude Haiku for analysis. Condensing:

- Reduces the volume of text sent to the API (saving tokens and costs)
- Preserves essential information about what happened
- Is performed before keyword extraction and memory generation
- Helps maintain focus on the most important parts of the session

This optimization is particularly important for long sessions where transcript content can be substantial.
