The extraction prompt template defines specific guidelines for what should and should not be extracted as memories. DO extract: architectural decisions, bug fixes with root cause, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, performance optimizations. DO NOT extract: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, sensitive data, or outdated information. This ensures extracted memories remain useful and relevant for future sessions.
