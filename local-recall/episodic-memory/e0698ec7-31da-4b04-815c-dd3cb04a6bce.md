When extracting memories from transcripts, follow this structure:
- Analyze what was learned, what is now known, and what problems were solved
- Return ONLY a valid JSON object with a "memories" array
- Each memory needs: subject (max 200 chars), keywords (1-10, lowercase), applies_to (scope), and content (markdown)
- Be specific with file paths and concrete details
- DO extract: architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships
- DO NOT extract: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging, obvious info, sensitive data, quick-to-become-outdated info
- If no valuable memories, return: { "memories": [] }
