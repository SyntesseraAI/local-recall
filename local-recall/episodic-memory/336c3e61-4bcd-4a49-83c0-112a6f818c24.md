Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files. Each memory file uses YAML frontmatter with fields like id (UUID), subject, keywords, applies_to (scope), occurred_at (ISO-8601), and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix). The system supports three scope types: global (entire codebase), file:<path> (specific files), and area:<name> (components/areas). All memories are version-controlled in git.
