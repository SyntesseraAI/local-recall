The SessionStart hook is designed for performance: it directly reads the 5 most recent memories from files by sorting on `occurred_at` rather than using vector search.

This is an intentional design choice to keep session startup fast without requiring embeddings or Orama index lookups. The hook:
1. Reads all memory files from disk
2. Sorts by `occurred_at` descending
3. Takes top 5
4. Outputs their content

This provides recent context without semantic search overhead.
