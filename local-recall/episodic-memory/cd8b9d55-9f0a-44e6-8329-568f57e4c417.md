Thinking memories store thought+output pairs extracted from Claude's internal reasoning blocks. Format:
- `## Thought` section contains internal reasoning
- `## Output` section contains the text response that followed

Thinking memories are retrieved based on semantic similarity (minimum threshold default 80%) and token budget (default 1000). They provide concrete examples of 'how I reasoned → what I produced' for similar tasks in future sessions.
