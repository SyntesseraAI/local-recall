The transcript parser expects events in a condensed format with specific markers:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool calls

This format is used for extracting memories from Claude Code sessions to help future AI assistants understand the codebase and session context.
