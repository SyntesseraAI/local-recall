The memory extraction process uses Claude Haiku via `claude -p --model haiku` to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories in JSON format. The extractor receives a condensed transcript with [User], [Assistant], [Tool], and [Result] events, along with project context including working directory. It analyzes what was learned, discovered problems solved, and codebase-specific knowledge to create structured memory objects with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content fields.
