Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search capabilities. The model is automatically downloaded and cached in `local_cache/` on first use. Initial startup may take 30-60 seconds while the model downloads. This is important for understanding performance on first run and the directory structure.
