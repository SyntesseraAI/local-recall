Claude stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` with a URL-encoded path pattern. The directory name is constructed from the project path: `/Users/joe/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/` contains session transcripts as JSONL files. Each line is a complete JSON object representing a single turn in the conversation.
