The memory extraction system in memory-extractor.ts uses Claude Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) to analyze transcripts and extract memories. It sends a prompt that instructs Claude to return structured JSON with memory objects containing: subject, keywords, applies_to, and content fields. The extractor parses the JSON response and validates each memory before storing. This approach allows intelligent identification of valuable patterns without manual configuration.
