The memory system prevents duplicate memories by tracking occurred_at timestamps and content_hash fields. When extracting memories from transcripts, the system checks if a memory with the same timestamp and content hash already exists before creating a new one. This ensures the memory store doesn't accumulate duplicates as transcripts are reprocessed.
