The IndexManager class and index.json file became redundant after migrating to SQLite with vector embeddings. IndexManager was used for keyword lookups and index refreshing, but SQLite + VectorStore now handles both. Removed: src/core/index.ts, src/core/vector-store-disk.ts, and index.test.ts. Updated imports in tools.ts, stop.ts, memory-extractor.ts, and index.ts. This cleanup reduces complexity and file I/O operations.
