# Current Development Focus

The user is working on a refactoring branch: `claude/refactor-memory-collection-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`

Recent commits indicate work on:
- Standardizing string quotes and improving logging consistency in user-prompt-submit hook
- Renaming memories directory from `memories` to `episodic-memory`
- Implementing transcript condensing for memory extraction
- Enhancing memory extraction and logging functionality
- Removing `created_at` field and sorting search results by `occurred_at`

This suggests active development on improving how memories are collected, condensed, and extracted from Claude Code transcripts.
