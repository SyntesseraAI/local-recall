When extracting or creating memories:
- Each memory should focus on ONE concept or discovery
- Avoid combining multiple unrelated ideas into a single memory
- Be specific with file paths, function names, and concrete details
- Include actionable information that helps avoid mistakes or improve efficiency
- Memories should remain relevant over time and not become outdated quickly
- Avoid storing generic programming knowledge already known to Claude
