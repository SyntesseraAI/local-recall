The memory extraction pipeline implements transcript condensing to reduce Claude API token usage. The transcript is condensed into a format with events like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, and `[Tool: Name]` before being sent to Claude for memory extraction. This significantly reduces the token count compared to sending raw transcripts, improving cost efficiency while preserving the essential information needed for memory extraction.
