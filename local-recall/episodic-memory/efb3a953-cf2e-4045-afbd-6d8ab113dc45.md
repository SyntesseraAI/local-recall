Local Recall uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The model (~133MB) automatically downloads to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use. Initial startup takes 30-60 seconds for model download. Subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file is corrupted, remove `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to re-download.
