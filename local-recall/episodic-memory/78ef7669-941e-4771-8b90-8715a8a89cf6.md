Vector search results in `src/core/vector-store.ts:200-270` are sorted by cosine distance similarity score (0.0 to 1.0 range). Scores are rounded to 2 decimal places (e.g., 0.65). When multiple results have identical rounded scores, they are secondarily sorted by `occurred_at` in descending order (newest first) to break ties and ensure recent memories are prioritized. This provides clean, predictable scoring and recency-based ranking for equivalent results.
