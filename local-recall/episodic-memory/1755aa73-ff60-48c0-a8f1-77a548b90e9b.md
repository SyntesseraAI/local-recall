Thinking memories capture Claude's internal reasoning paired with corresponding text outputs (tool-only responses are skipped). Format includes:
- Thought: Claude's reasoning block from the transcript
- Output: The text response that followed the thinking

When retrieved, these memories are injected as 'Previous Thoughts' showing concrete examples of similar reasoning patterns. Extraction runs with 20 parallel workers to handle large batches efficiently.
