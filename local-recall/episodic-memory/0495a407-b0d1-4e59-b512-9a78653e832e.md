The Stop hook is currently disabled. Memory extraction is handled by the MCP server daemon which processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. It syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection, and deletes/recreates memories when transcripts change.
