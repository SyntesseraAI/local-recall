The memory extractor not only calls Claude but also parses the returned JSON, validates the memory structure, and checks for duplicates using content hash comparison. This prevents storing identical memories multiple times. The extractor integrates with the memory management system to create deduplicated memories in the local-recall/episodic-memory/ directory.
