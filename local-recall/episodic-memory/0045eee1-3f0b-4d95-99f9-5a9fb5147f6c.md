# Transcript Condensing Strategy

When extracting memories from transcripts, tool invocations (Bash, Read, Edit, etc.) should be filtered out.

## Rationale

Tool invocations are implementation details that:
- Clutter the transcript with technical noise
- Are less relevant for memory extraction
- Focus on HOW something was done rather than WHAT was learned

## What to Keep

1. **User requests** - What the user asked
2. **Assistant explanations** - Key insights and findings
3. **Tool results** - Outcomes that led to insights
4. **Decisions made** - Architecture choices and solutions

## What to Filter

1. **Tool invocations** - The actual commands/parameters (Read file X, Edit Y, etc.)
2. **Intermediate steps** - Debugging attempts, trial-and-error
3. **Error messages** - Unless they led to important discoveries
4. **Transient logs** - Build output, test runs, etc.

## Implementation

The transcript should be pre-condensed before memory extraction to:
- Focus memory extraction on high-value content
- Reduce noise and improve memory quality
- Faster processing of transcripts

## Reference

See `src/core/transcript-collector.ts:80-120` for implementation details.
