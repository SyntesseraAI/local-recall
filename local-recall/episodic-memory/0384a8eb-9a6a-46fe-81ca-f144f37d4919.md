Memory extraction logic and prompts are centralized in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts. This module contains the Claude prompts used to extract memories from condensed transcripts, following the guidelines for what should and shouldn't be extracted (architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, conventions vs generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data).
