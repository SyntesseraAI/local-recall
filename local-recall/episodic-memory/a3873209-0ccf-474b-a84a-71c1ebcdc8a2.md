# Memory Extraction from Condensed Transcripts

The transcript-collector produces condensed transcripts with event-based structure:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

## Format

This condensed format is more suitable for memory extraction than raw JSONL because it:
- Removes noise and redundant conversation flow
- Highlights key actions and decisions
- Makes it easier to identify what was learned
- Reduces token usage for LLM-based extraction

The memory-extractor should be updated to handle this event-based format when processing transcripts.
