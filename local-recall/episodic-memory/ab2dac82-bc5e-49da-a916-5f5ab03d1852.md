Claude stores project transcript files in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project directories are encoded with the full path (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`). Each project has a unique JSON transcript file that tracks the conversation history.

This is important for:
- Understanding where Claude Code stores session data
- Building tools that need to access transcript history
- Implementing transcript-based memory extraction systems

The transcript file contains structured event data that can be parsed to extract memories and learn from past sessions.
