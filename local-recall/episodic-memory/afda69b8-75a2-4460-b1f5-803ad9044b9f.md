# Development Requirements

As documented in CLAUDE.md, this project has strict requirements for new features:

## Testing

- **All new features MUST have corresponding unit tests** in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests should be placed in `tests/integration/`
- Tests must cover both happy paths and edge cases
- Run tests with `npm test`

## Documentation

- Documentation must be placed in `docs/` folder
- Update existing docs when modifying functionality
- Keep documentation synchronized with code changes

## Implementation Process

1. Write feature code
2. Write comprehensive tests
3. Write/update documentation
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Commit with clear messages

## Importance

These requirements ensure code quality, maintainability, and help future AI assistants understand the codebase and features properly.
