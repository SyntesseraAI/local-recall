The memory extraction system is designed to capture valuable long-term knowledge that helps future AI assistants:

**DO Extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations and optimizations

**DO NOT Extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

This selective approach ensures the memory system contains high-value, durable knowledge that actually helps future work.
