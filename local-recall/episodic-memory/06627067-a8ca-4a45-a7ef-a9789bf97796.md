# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

Full transcripts can be very large and include noise. Before sending transcripts to Claude for memory extraction, they should be condensed.

## Why Condensing is Important

1. **Context length**: Full transcripts may exceed Claude's context window or incur unnecessary token costs
2. **Signal-to-noise ratio**: Transcripts include tool outputs, large code blocks, and other noise that doesn't contribute to memory
3. **Extraction quality**: Condensed transcripts focus Claude on the essential events and decisions

## Condensing Strategy

The transcript condenser should:
1. Extract key events:
   - User requests and questions
   - Assistant explanations and decisions
   - Tool invocations (name and purpose, not full output)
   - Results (success/failure, key insights)
2. Remove or summarize:
   - Large code block outputs
   - Verbose tool results
   - Repetitive actions
   - Intermediate debugging steps
3. Preserve:
   - The narrative flow
   - Important decisions and reasoning
   - File paths and specific changes
   - Error messages and resolutions

## Expected Condenser Output

A condensed transcript should be 10-30% of the original size while preserving enough information for Claude to extract meaningful memories.
