# Memory Extraction Process

The local-recall system automatically extracts memories from Claude Code session transcripts to build persistent knowledge. The process:

1. Analyzes condensed transcripts with [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], and [Result: OK/ERROR] markers
2. Identifies what was learned, discovered, and solved during the session
3. Creates structured memory objects with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and markdown content
4. Uses appropriate scope levels:
   - `global` for codebase-wide knowledge
   - `file:<path>` for file-specific information
   - `area:<name>` for component/area-specific knowledge

Memories should be specific, actionable, and avoid generic knowledge or temporary debugging steps. This allows future AI assistants to benefit from discoveries made in previous sessions.
