The extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` provides Claude Haiku with detailed instructions for converting transcript content into properly formatted memories. It specifies the YAML frontmatter structure (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash) and guides the model to extract relevant, actionable information. This prompt is critical for ensuring consistent memory quality and format.
