Memory extraction instructions are stored separately in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` as a dedicated prompt template file. This follows a separation of concerns pattern where the actual extraction logic is in `memory-extractor.ts` while the Claude prompt instructions are in the prompts directory. This makes it easier to modify extraction behavior without changing core implementation code.
