Technology stack includes TypeScript 5.9+, Node.js 18+, better-sqlite3 for SQLite database access, fastembed for generating embeddings, and sqlite-vec for vector similarity search. The embedding model (BGE-small-en-v1.5) is ~133MB and auto-downloads to local_cache/ on first run. If tokenizer file not found error occurs, delete the local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5* directory to force re-download.
