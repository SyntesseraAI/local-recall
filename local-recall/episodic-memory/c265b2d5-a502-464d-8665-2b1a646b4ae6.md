Local Recall uses three Claude Code hooks:

1. **SessionStart Hook** - Triggered when session begins, loads 5 most recent memories (sorted by `occurred_at`) and injects them into Claude's context
2. **UserPromptSubmit Hook** - Triggered before Claude processes a prompt, performs semantic search and injects matching memories
3. **Stop Hook** - Currently disabled; memory extraction is handled by MCP server daemon instead

Hooks are configured in `hooks.json` and execute as shell commands receiving JSON via stdin. Hooks receive `session_id`, `transcript_path`, and `cwd` as input.
