The memory-extractor.ts module uses Claude API (via Anthropic SDK) to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. It sends transcripts through a structured prompt template that guides Claude to identify learnings, discoveries, bug fixes, and architectural decisions. The extraction process returns an array of memory objects with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content fields.
