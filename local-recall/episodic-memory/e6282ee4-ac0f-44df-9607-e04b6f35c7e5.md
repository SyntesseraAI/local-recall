# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full transcript path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with the pattern: `{session_id}.jsonl`

Each line is a JSON object representing a single event in the transcript with fields like:
- `type` - Event type (e.g., "message", "tool_call", "tool_result")
- `timestamp` - When the event occurred
- Other fields depending on event type

## Usage in local-recall

The `transcript-collector.ts` uses this path structure to:
1. Calculate the project folder name from the working directory
2. Locate and read transcript JSONL files
3. Process transcripts to extract memories
4. Track processed transcripts by content hash to detect changes
