The embedding model is ~133MB and downloads to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` automatically on first use. This causes the first startup to take 30-60 seconds. If the cache is corrupted, delete the directory to force re-download. Common error: 'Tokenizer file not found' indicates incomplete cache that needs deletion.
