# Transcript Condensing Logic

The transcript condensing process filters out low-value content while preserving important information:

## Filtered Events (Removed)
- Tool invocations without meaningful output (e.g., empty Read results)
- Bash commands that don't produce actionable results
- Planning/thinking messages
- Repeated similar messages

## Preserved Events
- User requests and questions
- Assistant explanations and insights
- Tool calls with meaningful results
- Code changes and their rationale
- Errors and their resolutions
- Architectural decisions

This condensing helps focus memory extraction on genuinely valuable information.
