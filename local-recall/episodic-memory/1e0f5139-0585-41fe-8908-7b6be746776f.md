The transcript processing in local-recall expects a condensed format with clear event markers:

- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations with the tool name
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This structured format is critical for the memory-extractor to properly parse what happened during a session. The condensed format prevents the extractor from processing raw transcripts which would be too verbose and expensive to analyze.

Memory extraction should ignore temporary debugging steps and focus on learnings, architectural decisions, bug fixes, and code patterns that will be valuable to future assistants.
