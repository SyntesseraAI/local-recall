Claude Code hooks are defined in `hooks.json` and execute as shell commands that receive JSON input via stdin. SessionStart hook loads memory index and retrieves relevant memories. UserPromptSubmit hook extracts keywords from user prompt and searches for matching memories. Both hooks output memory content to stdout for injection into Claude's context.
