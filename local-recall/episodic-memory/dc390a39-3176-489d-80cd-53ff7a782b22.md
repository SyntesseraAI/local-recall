# Transcript File Format

Claude Code transcripts are stored in JSONL format (JSON Lines - one JSON object per line).

## Event Structure

Each line in a transcript file is a complete JSON object representing an event. Events have a consistent structure with:
- Type information (e.g., `type: "message"`, `type: "tool_call"`)
- Role information (e.g., `role: "user"`, `role: "assistant"`)
- Content and metadata appropriate to the event type

## Parsing Approach

When reading transcript files:
1. Read the file line by line
2. Parse each line as a separate JSON object
3. Do not attempt to parse the entire file as a single JSON array

This format allows for streaming processing and efficient handling of large transcripts.
