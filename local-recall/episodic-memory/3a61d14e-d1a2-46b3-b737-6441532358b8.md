The project uses `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The model is approximately 133MB and downloads automatically to `local_cache/` on first use.

**Performance Note:**
- First run takes 30-60 seconds while model downloads
- Subsequent runs load from cache (fast)
- Model cache stored in `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`

**Troubleshooting:**
If 'Tokenizer file not found' error occurs, the cache is corrupted. Delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and model will re-download on next run.
