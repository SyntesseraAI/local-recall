The memory extraction process uses Claude Haiku model to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. A detailed system prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` guides the analysis with specific guidelines for what should and shouldn't be extracted. The process returns structured JSON with a memories array containing subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and markdown content for each memory.
