# Memory Extraction Model Selection

The memory extractor should explicitly specify using `claude-haiku` model for extracting memories from transcripts.

This decision is based on:
- **Performance**: Haiku is fast and suitable for batch processing transcripts
- **Cost**: Cheaper than larger models for the straightforward task of memory extraction
- **Capability**: Haiku has sufficient capability for identifying valuable memories from transcripts

The model should be specified in the Claude API call when processing transcripts during memory extraction.
