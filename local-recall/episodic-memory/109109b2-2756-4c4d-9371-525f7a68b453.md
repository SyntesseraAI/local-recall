# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with forward slashes replaced by hyphens. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcript files are stored in JSONL format within the project folder:
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`
- Format: Each line is a JSON object representing a single event
- File naming: Multiple transcript files may exist (e.g., `transcript_1.jsonl`, `transcript_2.jsonl`)

## Important for Transcript Collector

The transcript collector needs to:
1. Convert the working directory path to the Claude project folder name
2. Locate the correct project folder under `~/.claude/projects/`
3. Read all `.jsonl` files from the `transcripts/` subdirectory
4. Parse each line as a separate JSON object (not parse the entire file as one JSON object)

This path conversion is critical for the MCP server's background daemon to correctly sync and process transcripts.
