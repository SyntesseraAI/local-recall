Memory extraction enforces strict guidelines:

**Scope Types:**
- `global` - applies to entire codebase
- `file:<path>` - specific to a file
- `area:<name>` - related to a component/area

**What to Extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**What NOT to Extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data (keys, passwords)
- Quickly-outdated information

Each memory must be concise, actionable, and include 1-10 searchable keywords in lowercase.
