# Local-Recall Memory Extraction Process

The local-recall system extracts memories from Claude Code session transcripts by:

1. Analyzing what was learned, discovered, and solved
2. Creating structured memory objects with:
   - `subject`: One-line brief description (max 200 chars)
   - `keywords`: Array of 1-10 searchable keywords
   - `applies_to`: Scope (global, file:<path>, or area:<name>)
   - `content`: Detailed markdown content

3. Using appropriate scope:
   - `global` for codebase-wide knowledge
   - `file:<path>` for file-specific information
   - `area:<name>` for component/area-specific info

4. Returning ONLY raw JSON with no markdown formatting or code blocks

Should extract architecture decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and user preferences. Should NOT extract generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, or trivial information.
