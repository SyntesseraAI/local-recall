The MCP server includes a background daemon that:
1. Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/)
2. Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
3. Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
4. Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
5. Runs every 5 minutes

The Stop hook is currently disabled, with memory extraction handled by this daemon instead.
