Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS. The project folder name is derived from the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example, `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`. Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory within each project folder.
