The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to analyze transcripts and identify valuable memories. It sends transcripts to Claude with a specialized extraction prompt that guides the model to identify:
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root causes
- Code patterns and conventions
- Configuration quirks
- User preferences
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

The extraction prompt is defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and includes detailed guidelines about what to extract vs what to skip.
