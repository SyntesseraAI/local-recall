# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

When extracting memories from Claude Code session transcripts (JSONL format), it's useful to condense the full transcript into a more manageable summary format:

## Condensed Format

- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses or explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool calls

## Why Condense

1. Reduces context size for memory extraction
2. Focuses on actionable information
3. Removes verbose output and redundant details
4. Makes it easier to identify key decisions and learnings

## Implementation Approach

When processing transcripts:
1. Parse the JSONL file line by line
2. Group messages by role (user/assistant)
3. Extract tool invocations separately
4. Summarize tool results briefly
5. Format as condensed text for analysis

This technique has been implemented in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` for the memory extraction pipeline.
