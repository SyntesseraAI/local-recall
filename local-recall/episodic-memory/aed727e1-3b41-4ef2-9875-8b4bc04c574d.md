Claude Code stores transcript files in the local-recall/transcripts/ directory. These are:
- Auto-generated by Claude during sessions
- Should NOT be committed to git
- Used by the MCP daemon for memory extraction
- Processed and tracked via processed-log.json

The transcripts/ directory must always be in the .gitignore file created in local-recall/
