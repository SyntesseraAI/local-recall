# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Replace slashes (`/`) with dashes (`-`)
- Remove leading slashes
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## Transcript Files

Transcript files are stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) format within the project folder:
- Located at: `~/.claude/projects/{project-folder-name}/transcripts/`
- Each line is a complete JSON object representing a transcript event
- Files may be compressed or stored in other formats

## Relevance to local-recall

The transcript-collector feature in local-recall needs to:
1. Construct the correct project folder path from `cwd` by replacing `/` with `-`
2. Read transcript files from `~/.claude/projects/{transformed-path}/transcripts/`
3. Parse `.jsonl` format to extract individual transcript events
4. Track processed transcripts by content hash to detect changes
