The SessionStart hook is triggered when Claude Code begins a session. It:
1. Loads all memories from disk via MemoryManager.listMemories()
2. Returns the 5 most recent memories (sorted by occurred_at)
3. Outputs memory content to stdout (injected into Claude's context)

Important: This is a full reload that does NOT use the vector store to avoid slow initialization on every session start. Only the UserPromptSubmit hook uses the vector store for semantic search.
