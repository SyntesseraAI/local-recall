The memory-extraction.ts file contains prompt templates that guide the memory extraction process. These prompts are used by the memory extractor to analyze session transcripts and determine what information should be preserved as memories. The prompts provide context about what makes a valuable memory and guide the extraction of actionable, specific information that will help future AI assistants working on the codebase.
