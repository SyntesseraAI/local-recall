Claude stores projects in `~/.claude/projects/` with a naming convention that encodes the project path by replacing `/` with `-`. The directory name matches the full absolute path to the project with dashes instead of slashes. Project session files have UUIDs and use `.jsonl` format for transcripts. This is used by the MCP server daemon to locate and sync transcripts for memory extraction.
