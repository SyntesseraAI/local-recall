Local Recall is a sophisticated memory system that enables Claude Code and other AI tools (via MCP) to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. The system stores memories locally within the repository as version-controlled markdown files with YAML frontmatter, using SQLite for vector embeddings to enable semantic search.

Key capabilities:
- Store and retrieve contextual information about the codebase
- Share knowledge across different coding sessions
- Semantic search using vector embeddings (BGE-small-en-v1.5 model)
- Support for multiple scopes (global, file-specific, area-specific)
- Integration with Claude Code via hooks and MCP server
- Background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously
