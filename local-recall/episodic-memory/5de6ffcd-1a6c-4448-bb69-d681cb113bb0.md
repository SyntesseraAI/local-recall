# Memory Extraction with Claude API

## Approach

Instead of simple regex-based or rule-based memory extraction, the system uses Claude API to intelligently extract memories from condensed transcripts.

## Benefits

- **Context-aware**: Claude understands the full context of what happened
- **Intelligent filtering**: Automatically distinguishes useful memories from noise
- **Natural language**: Works with any type of transcript content
- **Semantic understanding**: Extracts meaningful relationships and decisions

## Implementation Details

- Located in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts`
- Uses Claude's language understanding capabilities
- Takes condensed transcripts as input
- Outputs structured memory objects ready for storage

## Integration

This is used by the MCP server's memory extraction daemon to process new session transcripts and automatically create memories from them.
