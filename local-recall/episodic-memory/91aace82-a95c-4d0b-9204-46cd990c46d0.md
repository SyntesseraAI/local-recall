Both the session-start and user-prompt-submit hooks receive JSON input via stdin that includes:
- `session_id`: Identifier for the current session
- `transcript_path`: Path to the session transcript
- `cwd`: Current working directory (allows hooks to operate on the user's project, not the plugin directory)
- `prompt`: The user's submitted prompt (user-prompt-submit only)

The `cwd` parameter is crucial because the plugin runs from its own directory but needs to access memories stored relative to the user's project.
