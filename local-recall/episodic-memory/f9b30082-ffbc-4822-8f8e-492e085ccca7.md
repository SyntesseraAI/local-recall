# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full transcript path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format, one event per line).

## Relevance

This is critical for the transcript collector feature in local-recall, which needs to locate and process Claude Code session transcripts to extract memories automatically.
