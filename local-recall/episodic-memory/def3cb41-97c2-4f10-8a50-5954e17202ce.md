Memory files stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/*.md` are intentionally tracked in git version control. They are NOT gitignored. This allows team members to share memories and context across the codebase. Only `local-recall/index.json` (generated index) and `local-recall/recall.log` (debug logs) are gitignored. Memory files should be treated as important project artifacts that improve over time.
