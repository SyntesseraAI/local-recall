# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute file path using a deterministic encoding:
- Forward slashes `/` are converted to underscores `_`
- The root `/` becomes the first character
- Examples:
  - `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`
  - `/path/to/project` → `_path_to_project`

## Transcript Structure

Inside each project folder:
- Transcripts are stored as JSON files
- File naming follows the pattern `transcript_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`
- Each transcript contains the session's conversation history

## Relevance to Memory Extraction

This is critical for the transcript-collector component because it needs to:
1. Determine the correct path to the user's project based on `cwd`
2. Locate and sync transcripts from Claude's cache into the local-recall system
3. Process transcripts for memory extraction via the MCP server daemon
