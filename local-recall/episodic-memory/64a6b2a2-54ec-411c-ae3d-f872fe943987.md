# Transcript File Format

Claude Code transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) format, where each line is a separate JSON object.

## Structure

Each line in a transcript file is a JSON object with at minimum:
- `type`: String indicating the event type (e.g., "message", "tool_call", etc.)
- `content`: The actual content or data of the event
- Additional fields may include metadata about the event

## Parsing Approach

When processing transcript files:
1. Read the file line by line
2. Parse each line as separate JSON (not as a single JSON array)
3. Filter and process events based on their `type` field
4. Extract relevant information from the `content` field

## Important Notes

- Do NOT try to parse the entire file as a single JSON object
- Handle line-by-line parsing to avoid memory issues with large transcripts
- The `transcript.ts` utility should implement proper JSONL parsing
- This format allows for streaming/incremental processing of transcripts
