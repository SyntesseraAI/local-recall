The memory extraction system in memory-extractor.ts uses Claude Haiku API to process transcripts and generate structured memories. It leverages a carefully crafted prompt (from src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) that guides the model to extract specific, actionable memories about code changes, architectural decisions, and discovered patterns. The system uses role-based prompting to ensure consistent, high-quality memory generation across sessions.
