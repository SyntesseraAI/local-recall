The extraction process uses two distinct prompt files:

1. **System Prompt** - Defines Claude's role and guidelines for memory extraction
2. **User Prompt** - Contains instructions applied to each transcript

This separation allows:
- Reusable system instructions across all extraction runs
- Flexible user prompts that can be customized per transcript
- Clear distinction between general rules and specific input

The prompts guide Claude to extract memories with proper scope (global, file:path, area:name), keywords, and structured content.
