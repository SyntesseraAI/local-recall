The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku to process transcripts and generate memories. It employs a structured prompt system defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides the model to extract valuable memories in a consistent format. The extraction process is designed to identify architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and project-specific conventions from session transcripts.
