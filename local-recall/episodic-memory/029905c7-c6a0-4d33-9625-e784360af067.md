The MCP server process is running from:
- Location: `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/mcp-server/server.js`
- Config: `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.mcp.json`
- PID: 4524 (as of last check)

The main project root at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/` doesn't have a built `dist/` or `scripts/` directory yet. The plugin subdirectory is the active MCP server location.
