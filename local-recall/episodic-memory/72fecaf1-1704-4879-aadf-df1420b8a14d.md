# Transcript JSONL Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files where each line is a complete JSON object representing an event.

## Event Structure

Each line contains a JSON object with:
- `type`: The event type (e.g., "user_message", "assistant_response", "tool_invocation")
- `content`: The event content (varies by type)
- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp of when the event occurred
- Other metadata fields depending on event type

## Event Types

Common event types include:
- `user_message`: User input to Claude
- `assistant_response`: Claude's response
- `tool_invocation`: Claude invoking a tool (Read, Edit, Bash, etc.)
- `tool_result`: Result of a tool invocation

## Parsing Considerations

When parsing JSONL:
1. Read the file line by line
2. Parse each line as JSON independently
3. Handle malformed lines gracefully
4. Filter and process events based on type

This format allows for streaming processing and easy incremental updates.
