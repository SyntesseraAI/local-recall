The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API with streaming to analyze session transcripts. It sends the transcript content through Claude (via `anthropic` client) and streams the response to extract valuable memories. The extractor is designed to process transcripts asynchronously and identify patterns, decisions, and insights that should be persisted for future sessions.
