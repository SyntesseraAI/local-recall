The memory extraction system is implemented as part of the MCP server daemon which runs in the background. Rather than extracting memories synchronously via the Stop hook, the daemon periodically scans for new/modified transcripts and processes them asynchronously. This approach prevents blocking Claude Code and allows continuous memory collection without impacting the user experience. The daemon tracks processed transcripts to avoid re-processing unchanged content.
