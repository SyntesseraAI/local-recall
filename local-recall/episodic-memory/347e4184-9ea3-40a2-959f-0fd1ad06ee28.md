The MCP server includes a background daemon that syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`) and processes them using `claude -p` to extract memories. The daemon tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection and deletes/recreates memories when transcripts change. It runs every 5 minutes asynchronously. The Stop hook is currently disabled in favor of this asynchronous approach.
