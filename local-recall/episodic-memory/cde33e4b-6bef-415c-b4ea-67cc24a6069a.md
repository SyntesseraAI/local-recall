The memory extraction prompt (memory-extraction.ts) provides Claude with:
- Comprehensive guidelines for what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns)
- Clear guidelines for what NOT to extract (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data)
- Structured output format requirements (JSON with memories array)
- Project context about working directory and transcript format
- Scope guidelines for applying memories (global, file:<path>, area:<name>)

The prompt emphasizes:
- Being specific with file paths and function names
- Being concise (one concept per memory)
- Being actionable for future sessions
- Avoiding outdated or generic information
