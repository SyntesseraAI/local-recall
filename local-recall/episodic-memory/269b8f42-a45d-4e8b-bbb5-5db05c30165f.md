Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows multiple AI agents to store and retrieve contextual information about codebases. All memories are stored locally within the repository as markdown files with YAML frontmatter, making them version-controllable and shareable among team members.

Key features:
- Semantic search using vector embeddings (BGE-small-en-v1.5 model via fastembed)
- SQLite-backed vector store for efficient similarity search
- Claude Code hook integration (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit)
- MCP server for memory tool exposure
- Asynchronous transcript processing every 5 minutes
