Local Recall uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. Model is automatically downloaded to local_cache/ on first use. First startup takes 30-60 seconds while model downloads. Subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file corruption occurs, delete local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5* and model will re-download.
