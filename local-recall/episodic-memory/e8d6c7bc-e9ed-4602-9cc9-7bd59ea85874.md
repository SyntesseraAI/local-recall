The memory manager prevents duplicates using a combination of:
- `occurred_at`: ISO-8601 timestamp of when the original event occurred
- `content_hash`: SHA-256 hash prefix (16 chars) of the memory content

The `findDuplicate(occurredAt, contentHash)` function checks for existing memories with matching timestamps and content hashes. This allows tracking when the same event was recorded multiple times and prevent duplicate memories in the system.
