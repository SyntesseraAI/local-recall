# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`:
- Each line is a separate JSON object representing a transcript event
- Filenames follow pattern: `<timestamp>.jsonl` (e.g., `1733093164.jsonl`)
- Events include timestamps and message content

## Implications for Memory Extraction

The transcript-collector needs to:
1. Handle the path transformation (slashes to dashes) to locate transcripts
2. Parse JSONL format (one JSON object per line)
3. Extract individual events from transcript files
4. Track which transcripts have been processed to avoid duplicates
