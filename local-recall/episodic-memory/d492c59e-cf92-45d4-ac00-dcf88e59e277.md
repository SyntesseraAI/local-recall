The memory extraction system processes transcripts in a condensed format with events marked as:
- `[User]` - User requests and questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude explanations and responses
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This structured format helps Claude understand the context and flow of what happened during the session, enabling more accurate memory extraction.
