Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system that enables Claude Code and other AI tools (via MCP) to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. All memories are stored locally within the repository and are version-controllable. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings (fastembed BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic search capability.
