The file `local-recall/orama-episodic-index.json` is a generated vector index file that should be gitignored. It's created automatically when memories are added to the vector store. Similarly, `local-recall/orama-thinking-index.json` is the thinking memory index. These are not manually edited and are regenerated as needed.
