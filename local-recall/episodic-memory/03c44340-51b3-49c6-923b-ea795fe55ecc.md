Local Recall enables persistent memory across Claude Code sessions through structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Uses SQLite with vector embeddings (fastembed BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic search. Memories stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory as version-controlled markdown files. Vector database in `memory.sqlite` is gitignored and auto-generated.
