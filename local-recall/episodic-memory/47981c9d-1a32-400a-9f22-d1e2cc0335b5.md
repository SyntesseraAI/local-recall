Based on the CLAUDE.md requirements and the user's active development of this system, new memories should be created with clear, specific content. All new features must have corresponding unit tests in `tests/unit/` and integration tests in `tests/integration/`. Documentation must be placed in the `docs/` folder and should be updated when modifying functionality.
