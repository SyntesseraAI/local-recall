The memory extraction process can receive transcripts that contain nested `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` markers. This appears to be how the system handles recursive or chained memory extraction requests. The outer marker indicates the memory extraction task, and inner markers indicate previous extraction contexts or additional instructions.

This is important for understanding how the transcript is structured when analyzing it - multiple levels of LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL sections may appear, representing different stages of the extraction process.
