The memory-extractor.ts module is responsible for analyzing transcripts and creating memories from Claude's interactions. It processes condensed transcript events to extract valuable information that future AI assistants can use. The module integrates with the memory creation system to store extracted memories with proper metadata including subject, keywords, scope, and content hash for deduplication.
