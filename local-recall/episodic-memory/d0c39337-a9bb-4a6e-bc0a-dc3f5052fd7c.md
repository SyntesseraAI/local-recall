The memory-extractor.ts module contains the MemoryExtractor class that processes Claude transcripts to extract valuable memories. Key responsibilities:

- Condenses transcripts using Claude Haiku to reduce verbosity while preserving essential information
- Extracts structured memories from condensed transcripts with metadata (subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash)
- Validates extracted memories for completeness and quality
- Handles deduplication by checking for existing memories with same occurred_at and content_hash
- Returns extracted memories in a structured format ready for storage

The module exports a MemoryExtractor class with methods for processing transcripts and extracting memories.
