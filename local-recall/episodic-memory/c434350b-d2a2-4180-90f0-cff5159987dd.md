The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku (via the `claude -p --model haiku` command) to extract keywords from transcript content. This is part of the MCP server's background daemon which processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. The extracted keywords are used to automatically create memories from session transcripts.
