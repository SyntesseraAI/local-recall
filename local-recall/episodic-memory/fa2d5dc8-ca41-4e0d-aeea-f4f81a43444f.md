Memory extraction is a critical component of Local Recall that analyzes session transcripts to automatically create memories. This allows the system to learn from each session and help future assistants working on the codebase. The extraction process is designed to identify architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and other valuable insights from session activities.
