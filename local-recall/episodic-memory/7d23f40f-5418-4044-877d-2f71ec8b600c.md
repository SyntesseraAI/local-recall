Memory files are stored as structured markdown with YAML frontmatter containing:
- id: UUID
- subject: Brief one-line description (max 200 chars)
- keywords: Array of searchable keywords (lowercase, specific)
- applies_to: Scope (global, file:<path>, or area:<name>)
- content: Detailed memory in markdown format
- occurred_at: ISO-8601 timestamp
- content_hash: SHA-256 hash prefix for deduplication

Memories are atomic (one concept per memory) and version-controlled in the episodic-memory directory.
