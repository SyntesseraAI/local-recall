Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. Memory files are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory as markdown files with YAML frontmatter. The index.json is auto-generated and gitignored. Memory files themselves ARE version-controlled and tracked in git. The project root is the plugin root for Claude Code integration.
