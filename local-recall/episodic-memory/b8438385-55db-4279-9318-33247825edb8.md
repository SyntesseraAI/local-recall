# Stop Hook Disabled

The Stop hook is currently **disabled** in the Local Recall project. Memory extraction is handled asynchronously by the MCP server daemon instead of at session end.

## Rationale

- **Non-blocking**: Asynchronous processing prevents delays when ending Claude Code sessions
- **Reliable**: Background daemon ensures transcripts are processed even if Stop hook fails
- **Flexible**: 5-minute polling interval allows batch processing of multiple session transcripts

## Related Configuration

See `hooks.json` and MCP server documentation for details on the daemon implementation.
