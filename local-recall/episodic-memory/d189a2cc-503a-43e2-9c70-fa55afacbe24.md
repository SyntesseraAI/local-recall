# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

Large transcript files can cause performance issues and memory extraction complexity. The system implements transcript condensing to optimize memory extraction.

## Problem

- Transcript files grow over time and can become very large
- Processing entire transcripts repeatedly is inefficient
- Duplicate memories can be created from the same content

## Solution

Transcript condensing extracts key information:
- Removes redundant or verbose content
- Reduces file size while preserving semantic meaning
- Improves efficiency of memory extraction process

## Implementation

- Condensing logic was added to the memory extraction pipeline
- Uses content-based deduplication (content_hash field) to prevent duplicate memories
- The `occurred_at` timestamp is used for change detection

## Impact

- Reduces processing time for memory extraction
- Prevents memory duplication from repeated transcript processing
- Improves overall system performance with large transcript histories
