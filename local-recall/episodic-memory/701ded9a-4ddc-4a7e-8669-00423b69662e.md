# Embedding Model Caching

Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search.

## Download Behavior

- The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use
- First run may take 30-60 seconds while the model downloads
- Subsequent runs load from the cached model
- If the cache becomes corrupted, remove `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and let it re-download

This is important to document for new users who may experience slow initial startup times.
