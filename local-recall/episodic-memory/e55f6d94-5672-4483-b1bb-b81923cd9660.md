Claude stores project transcripts in ~/.claude/projects/<hashed-path>/transcripts/. The local-recall transcript collector finds the correct project folder by:

1. **Primary approach**: Hash the working directory path and look for a matching folder in ~/.claude/projects/
2. **Fallback**: Scan all directories in ~/.claude/projects/ and check if any contain transcripts with the current cwd in their metadata
3. **Last resort**: Check for directories ending with expected cwd pattern

This multi-level approach ensures transcripts are found even if Claude's hashing algorithm isn't exactly replicated.
