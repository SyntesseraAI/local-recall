Local Recall uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. Model is cached in `local_cache/` directory on first download (30-60 seconds). Subsequent runs load from cache. Common issue: 'Tokenizer file not found' error indicates corrupted cache from interrupted download - fix by removing `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` directory to trigger re-download.
