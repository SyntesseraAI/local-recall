The local-recall project implements transcript condensing as part of the memory extraction process. This feature reduces transcript size by removing redundant information while preserving essential context needed for memory creation.

This helps:
- Reduce API costs when sending transcripts to Claude for analysis
- Focus memory extraction on meaningful interactions
- Improve extraction quality by removing noise

The implementation is part of the core memory-extractor module and is used by hooks when processing session transcripts.
