Memory extraction instructions are centralized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This file contains the detailed prompt that tells Claude Haiku how to analyze transcripts and identify valuable memories to extract. The prompt includes guidelines for what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks) and what NOT to extract (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data).
