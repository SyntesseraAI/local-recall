The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API with streaming enabled for efficient processing of transcripts. It processes condensed transcript events and extracts memories using a specialized prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. The system handles both happy paths and error cases gracefully.
