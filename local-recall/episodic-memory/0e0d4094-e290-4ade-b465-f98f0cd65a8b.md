# Local Recall Plugin Installation

## Status
The local-recall project was successfully installed as a Claude Code plugin using the `/plugin` command. This makes the memory tools available within Claude Code without requiring manual configuration of the MCP server.

## Impact
- The plugin is now available in Claude Code
- Claude Code needs to be restarted to load the new plugin
- This integration enables the memory extraction and retrieval features to work seamlessly within the Claude Code environment
