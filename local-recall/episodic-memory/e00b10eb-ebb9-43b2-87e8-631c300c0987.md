Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system stored in /Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall. Memory files are stored in local-recall/episodic-memory/ as markdown files with YAML frontmatter containing: id (UUID), subject, keywords (array), applies_to (scope), occurred_at (ISO-8601), and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix). Memory files are version-controlled in git. The index (local-recall/index.json) is gitignored and auto-generated. Three main hooks handle integration: SessionStart (loads memory index), UserPromptSubmit (searches memories), and Stop (parses transcripts). MCP server exposes memory tools for any compatible client.
