# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The memory extraction process uses transcript condensing to improve efficiency and reduce noise when extracting memories from Claude Code sessions.

## Implementation Location

See `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` for the implementation of transcript condensing logic.

## Purpose

Transcript condensing:
- Reduces the amount of raw data sent to the Claude model for analysis
- Focuses on meaningful interactions and decisions
- Improves the quality of extracted memories by filtering out noise
- Makes the extraction process more efficient

## Notes

- This was a recent feature addition (based on commit history)
- Condensing happens before memory extraction
- The condensed transcript format is still in JSONL or similar structured format
