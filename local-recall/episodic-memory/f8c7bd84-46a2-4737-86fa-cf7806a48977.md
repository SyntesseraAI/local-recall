Investigation of 69,308 transcript entries found 14 messages with multiple thinking blocks. All cases were duplicate thinking blocks caused by streaming artifacts, not true interleaved thinking (thinking → tool_use → thinking patterns). Verified with content hashing - 100% of cases had identical thinking block content across multiple entries within the same message.
