Both MemoryManager (src/core/memory.ts) and IndexManager manage .gitignore creation in local-recall/. The IndexManager was creating it, but MemoryManager should also ensure it exists since MemoryManager may be invoked before IndexManager runs. This is a coordination pattern to ensure critical files are created early regardless of execution order.

Key insight: When multiple managers handle file initialization, each should be responsible for ensuring the files they depend on exist, rather than relying on initialization order.
