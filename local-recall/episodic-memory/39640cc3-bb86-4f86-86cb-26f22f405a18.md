# Session Start Memory Loading

The SessionStart hook performs a **full reload** of all memories, not a delta:

**Process**:
1. Creates a fresh `MemoryManager` instance
2. Calls `listMemories()` to load all memories from disk
3. Sorts by `occurred_at` descending (newest first)
4. Takes the 5 most recent memories
5. Returns them as context to inject into Claude's session

**Key Points**:
- Not incremental - always loads all memories then filters to top 5
- Each session starts fresh with the most recent context
- No tracking of what was shown in previous sessions
- Simple and reliable, no complex delta logic needed
