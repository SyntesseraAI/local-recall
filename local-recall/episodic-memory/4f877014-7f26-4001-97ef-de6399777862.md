A transcript condensing feature was implemented to reduce JSONL file sizes while preserving essential information for memory extraction.

The condenser extracts:
- User prompts and assistant responses
- Tool invocations and their results
- Error messages and exceptions

It removes:
- Tool output/results that are lengthy
- Repetitive metadata
- Non-essential debugging information

This reduces file sizes from megabytes to kilobytes while maintaining enough context for the MCP server to extract meaningful memories. The condensed format is easier to parse and process for memory generation.
