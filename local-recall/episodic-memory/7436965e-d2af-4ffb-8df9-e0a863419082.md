The vector store is backed by better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings are generated using fastembed library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). Cosine distance similarity scores range from 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (identical), rounded to 2 decimal places. Results are sorted by score descending with recency tie-breaker (more recent memories ranked first when scores are equal).
