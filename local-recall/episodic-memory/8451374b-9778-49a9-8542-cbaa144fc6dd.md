Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files stored in the local-recall/ directory. Each memory file has YAML frontmatter with fields: id (UUID), subject (brief description), keywords (array), applies_to (scope), occurred_at (timestamp), content_hash (SHA-256). Memory files are version-controlled and shareable. The system uses FastEmbed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search via SQLite vector store.
