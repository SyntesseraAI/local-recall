Local Recall integrates with Claude Code via three hooks: SessionStart (loads 5 most recent memories on session begin), UserPromptSubmit (semantic search on user prompt before processing), and Stop (disabled - memory extraction now handled by MCP server daemon). Hooks are configured in .claude/settings.json and receive JSON input via stdin.
