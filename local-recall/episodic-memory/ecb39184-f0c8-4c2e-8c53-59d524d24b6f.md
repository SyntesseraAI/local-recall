Local Recall uses FastEmbed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model for semantic search. Model automatically downloads to local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/ on first run (takes 30-60 seconds), then loaded from cache on subsequent runs. If tokenizer file not found error occurs (corrupted cache from interrupted download), remove local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5* directory - model will re-download automatically.
