# Memory Extraction Keyword Analysis

The transcript analysis for memory extraction uses Claude Haiku (via `claude -p --model haiku`) to semantically analyze user prompts and extract relevant keywords.

## Implementation Details

- The `claude -p` command is used to run Claude in a programmatic mode
- Haiku model is chosen for speed and efficiency
- Keywords are extracted based on semantic understanding of what the user was trying to accomplish
- This is more effective than simple keyword matching because it understands context and intent
- The extracted keywords are then used to search the memory index for relevant past experiences
