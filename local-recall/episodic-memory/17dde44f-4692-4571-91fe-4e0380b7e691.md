Memory deduplication uses a combination of: occurred_at (ISO-8601 timestamp from original event for sorting/deduplication) and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix of content). The MemoryManager.findDuplicate() method checks for existing duplicates before creating new memories. When scores are equal in search results, more recent memories are ranked first as a tie-breaker.
