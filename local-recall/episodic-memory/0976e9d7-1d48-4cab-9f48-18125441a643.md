# Transcript Condensing

Transcripts can be condensed to reduce size and improve processing efficiency.

## What Gets Condensed

- Multiple consecutive tool invocations (e.g., Read, Grep, Bash commands) are aggregated
- Tool results and errors are grouped together
- Reduces transcript size while preserving important information

## Benefits

- Smaller transcripts sent to Claude for memory extraction
- Faster processing of transcripts
- Reduces token usage when using `claude -p` to extract memories
- Still retains all critical information needed for memory extraction

## Implementation

Transcript condensing is implemented in the transcript utilities and used by the MCP server daemon when processing transcripts for memory extraction.
