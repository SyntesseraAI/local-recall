The Local Recall system uses the MCP server daemon to process transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. The Stop hook is disabled, and instead memory extraction happens in the background via `transcript-condenser.ts` and `memory-extractor.ts`. This allows for non-blocking memory creation from session transcripts.
