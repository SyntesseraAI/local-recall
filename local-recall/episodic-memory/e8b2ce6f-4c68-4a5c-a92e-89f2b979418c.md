# Transcript Collector Error Handling

The transcript-collector may encounter file not found errors when:
- Claude Code hasn't created transcripts yet
- The project folder path doesn't match expected format
- Transcripts were deleted or moved

## Solution

When a transcript file is not found, the collector should:
1. Log the error with sufficient detail for debugging
2. Continue processing (don't crash)
3. Return an empty array or null rather than throwing
4. Provide helpful context in the error message (e.g., searched path)

## Implementation Note

This is especially important during initial testing when Claude Code sessions may not have generated transcripts yet. The collector should be resilient to missing files.
