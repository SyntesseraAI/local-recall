Local Recall implements semantic search using the fastembed library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use and cached for subsequent runs. First startup may take 30-60 seconds while the model downloads. This provides vector-based similarity search capabilities in addition to fuzzy keyword matching for finding relevant memories.
