Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows AI agents to store and retrieve contextual information about codebases across sessions. Key characteristics:

- All memories stored locally in markdown format with YAML frontmatter in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
- Memories are version-controlled and shareable among team members
- Integrated with Claude Code via hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop)
- Provides MCP server for any MCP-compatible client
- Uses BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model for semantic search (~133MB, cached locally)
- Index stored at `local-recall/index.json` (gitignored, auto-generated)
