Local Recall integrates with Claude Code via hooks:
- **SessionStart**: Loads 5 most recent memories on session start (full reload, avoids slow vector store init)
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Performs semantic search using vector embeddings on user prompts
- **Stop**: Currently disabled; memory extraction is handled by MCP server daemon

Hooks are configured in `hooks.json` and execute as shell commands receiving JSON via stdin, outputting memory content to stdout for context injection.
