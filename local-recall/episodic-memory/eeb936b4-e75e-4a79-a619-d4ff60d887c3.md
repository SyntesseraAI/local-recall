# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts stored at: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format), not standard JSON. Each line is a separate JSON object representing an event in the transcript.

## Implications for Memory Extraction

When building the transcript collector, parsing logic must:
1. Replace slashes with dashes when constructing the project folder path
2. Read `.jsonl` files line-by-line as separate JSON objects
3. Handle the case where a project folder doesn't exist yet (first transcript hasn't been created)

This is important for the MCP server's background daemon that syncs transcripts and extracts memories.
