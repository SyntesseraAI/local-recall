A local HTTP daemon approach (embedding server built into MCP server) won't work for multiple Claude instances because each instance would still create its own daemon process, leading to multiple ONNX loads and the same mutex issues.

The fundamental requirement: multiple Claude instances running simultaneously need either (1) a true shared singleton daemon like Ollama that runs outside of Claude, or (2) pure-JavaScript libraries that don't have ONNX concurrency limitations.
