The memory extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` provides detailed guidelines for what should and shouldn't be extracted:

**Extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**Don't Extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Quick-to-become-outdated information

Memories must have proper scoping: `global` (entire codebase), `file:<path>` (specific files), or `area:<name>` (component areas).
