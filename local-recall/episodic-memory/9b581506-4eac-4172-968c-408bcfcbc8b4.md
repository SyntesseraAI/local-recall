# Embedding Model for Semantic Search

Local Recall uses `fastembed` with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search capabilities.

## Model Details

- **Library**: fastembed (Rust-based, efficient)
- **Model**: BGE-small-en-v1.5
- **Size**: ~133MB
- **Cache Location**: `local_cache/` directory
- **First Run**: 30-60 seconds (one-time model download)
- **Subsequent Runs**: Loads from cache

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter tokenizer file not found errors:
1. Remove corrupted cache: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*`
2. The model will re-download automatically on next run

This model provides semantic understanding beyond keyword matching for better memory retrieval.
