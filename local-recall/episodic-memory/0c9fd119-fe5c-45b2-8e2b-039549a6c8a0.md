Memories use an `applies_to` field to determine scope:
- `global` - Applies to the entire codebase (architecture, conventions)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component/area (e.g., `area:authentication`)

Proper scoping ensures memories are retrieved in relevant contexts and helps future assistants find applicable information quickly.
