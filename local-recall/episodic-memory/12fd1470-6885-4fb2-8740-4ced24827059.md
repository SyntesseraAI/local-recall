The `.gitignore` file created in the `local-recall` folder needs to exclude:
- `transcripts/` - Claude's cached transcripts that shouldn't be version controlled
- `processed-log.json` - Log file tracking processed transcripts for the daemon

These are auto-generated files that are maintained by the system and not user-editable. The gitignore template is maintained in two places:
1. `src/core/index.ts` - generateGitignore() function
2. `src/core/memory.ts` - gitignore template definition

Both must be kept in sync when updating the template.
