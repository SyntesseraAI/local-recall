Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows Claude Code and other AI tools to store and retrieve contextual information about codebases across sessions. All memories are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory and are version-controlled in git. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings (BGE-small-en-v1.5 model via fastembed) for semantic search.
