Memory extraction is a key component of the local-recall system's transcript processing pipeline. The MCP server daemon processes transcripts asynchronously (every 5 minutes) to extract memories using the memory-extractor module. This enables:

- Automatic capture of insights from Claude Code sessions
- Asynchronous processing to avoid blocking other operations
- Deduplication using content hashes to prevent duplicate memories
- Change detection to update memories when transcripts are modified

Memories extracted from transcripts help future sessions retrieve relevant context automatically.
