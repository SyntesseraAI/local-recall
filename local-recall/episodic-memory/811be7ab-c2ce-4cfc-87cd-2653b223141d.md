Memories use three scope levels to indicate their applicability:

1. **global** - Applies to the entire codebase (architecture, conventions, project-wide preferences)
2. **file:<path>** - Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
3. **area:<name>** - Related to a component or logical area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

Proper scope selection ensures that memories are retrieved in relevant contexts. For example, a memory about transcript parsing would use `area:transcript-processing` while a memory about coding style would use `global`.
