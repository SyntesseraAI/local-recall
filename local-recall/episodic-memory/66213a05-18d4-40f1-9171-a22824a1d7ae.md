The project root is the plugin root. Hooks configured in hooks.json use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} to reference scripts relative to plugin installation. Hooks receive `cwd` via stdin to operate on the user's project directory. This allows the plugin to work correctly when installed in different locations.
