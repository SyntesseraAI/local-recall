The vector store (src/core/vector-store.ts) uses better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for semantic search. Similarity scores use cosine distance (0.0-1.0 range, rounded to 2 decimal places). When scores are equal, memories with more recent `occurred_at` timestamps are ranked first (recency tie-breaker).
