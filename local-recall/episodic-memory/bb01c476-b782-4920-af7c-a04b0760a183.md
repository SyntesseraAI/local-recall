The memory extraction prompt (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) provides detailed guidelines for extracting memories:

- **DO extract**: Architectural decisions, bug fixes with root cause analysis, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, performance optimizations
- **DO NOT extract**: Generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, sensitive data, outdated information
- Returns memories in structured JSON format with subject (max 200 chars), keywords (1-10 lowercase), applies_to scope, and markdown content
- Specifies scope types: `global` (entire codebase), `file:<path>` (specific file), `area:<name>` (component/area)
- Memories should be specific with file paths/function names, concise (one concept per memory), and actionable
