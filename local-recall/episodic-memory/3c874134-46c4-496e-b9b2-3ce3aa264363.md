# TranscriptCollector Directory Validation

When collecting transcripts from Claude's cache, the `TranscriptCollector` must handle the case where the transcript directory does not exist (e.g., on first run or in new projects).

## Current Issue

The implementation should gracefully handle missing directories instead of throwing errors. This is important for:
- First-run scenarios where transcripts haven't been created yet
- New project setups
- Different OS configurations

## Recommendation

Add validation in `transcript-collector.ts` to check if the directory exists before attempting to read it, and return an empty array or handle appropriately when transcripts are not found.
