Transcripts are condensed into an event-based format before memory extraction. This condensed format uses markers like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]` to represent session activities. This format is more efficient for the AI to analyze and extract memories from, reducing token usage while maintaining important context about what happened in the session.
