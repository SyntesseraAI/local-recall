# Memory Extraction Guidelines for Local Recall

## What to Extract

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the codebase
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Scope Guidelines

- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area

## Memory Quality Standards

- Be specific: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- Be concise: Focus on one concept per memory
- Be actionable: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work efficiently
- Use appropriate scope based on applicability
