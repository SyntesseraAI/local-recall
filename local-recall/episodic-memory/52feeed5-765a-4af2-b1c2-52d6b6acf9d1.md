# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Naming Convention

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by hyphens and prefixed with a hash. This makes transcript collection important for the memory extraction feature.

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) with entries for each message in the conversation.

## Relevance to Local Recall

Understanding this structure is critical for the MCP server's background daemon which syncs transcripts from Claude's cache to process memories asynchronously.
