Claude stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project directories are named with URL-encoded paths matching the repo folder name. Example: `/Users/joe/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

This is used by the Local Recall MCP server daemon to sync transcripts and extract memories asynchronously every 5 minutes.
