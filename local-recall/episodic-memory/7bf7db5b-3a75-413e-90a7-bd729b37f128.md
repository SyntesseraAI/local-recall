When extracting memories from session transcripts:

**What to extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations

**What NOT to extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

**Scope guidelines:**
- `global` - Entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`)

Each memory should be specific, concise, and actionable with file paths and concrete details.
