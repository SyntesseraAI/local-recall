Memory extraction prompts are stored in a dedicated `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` module rather than being hardcoded in the extractor logic. This separation allows for easier prompt iteration and updates without modifying the core extraction logic, following a clean architecture pattern for prompt management.
