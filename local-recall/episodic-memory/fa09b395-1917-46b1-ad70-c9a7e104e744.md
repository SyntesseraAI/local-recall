Previously, transcripts were processed sequentially in a `for` loop within `processAllTranscripts` (lines 413-415 of memory-extractor.ts). This was a bottleneck when dealing with many transcripts. The implementation now uses a semaphore-based concurrent approach that processes multiple transcripts in parallel (default 10) while still respecting resource limits. This significantly improves throughput for bulk transcript processing.
