The local-recall project uses the official Anthropic SDK (likely @anthropic-ai/sdk or similar) for making API calls to Claude models. This is used in the memory extraction pipeline to analyze transcripts and generate memory metadata. The SDK provides:

- Type-safe API client
- Structured request/response handling
- Error handling and retries
- Support for different Claude models

This is a core dependency for the memory extraction functionality.
