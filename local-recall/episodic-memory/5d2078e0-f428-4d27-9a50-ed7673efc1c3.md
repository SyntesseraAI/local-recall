# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder name: `_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line):
- Session transcripts end with `.jsonl`
- Each line contains a transcript event with timestamp, type, and content
- Files are named with timestamps and session identifiers

## Accessing Transcripts

When processing transcripts in the memory extraction system:
1. Get the project path from Claude Code's context
2. Convert absolute path to project folder name (replace `/` with `_`)
3. Look in `~/.claude/projects/{project_folder}/transcripts/`
4. Read JSONL files sequentially

## Usage in Local Recall

The `transcript-collector` module uses this path to:
- Access Claude's cached transcripts
- Extract memories from completed sessions
- Track processed transcripts to avoid re-processing
- Sync transcript data with the memory index
