The project architecture includes: src/core/memory.ts for CRUD operations (no update - memories are idempotent), src/core/vector-store.ts using better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for semantic search, src/core/search.ts for search implementation, and other core services for embedding, transcript collection, and memory extraction.
