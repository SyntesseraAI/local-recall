# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`
- Transcripts location: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line). Each line contains a transcript event with the format shown in transcript-collector.ts.

## Key Discovery

This path conversion is critical for the transcript collector to locate and process transcripts from Claude Code sessions. The conversion must handle:
- Converting absolute filesystem paths to folder names
- Replacing forward slashes with dashes
- Properly constructing the full path to the transcripts directory

Without proper path conversion, the MCP server cannot find transcripts to process.
