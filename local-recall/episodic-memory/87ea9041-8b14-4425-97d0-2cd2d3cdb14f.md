The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to process transcripts and extract valuable memories. It uses a structured extraction prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide the model in identifying and formatting memories. This approach enables automated knowledge capture from session transcripts.
