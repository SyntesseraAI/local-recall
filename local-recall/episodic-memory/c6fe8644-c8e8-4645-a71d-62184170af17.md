# Memory Extraction Trigger

Based on the CLAUDE.md documentation and project architecture, memory extraction is NOT automatically triggered by the Stop hook. Instead:

1. The Stop hook is currently disabled
2. Memory extraction can be triggered manually through:
   - User requests to save memories
   - MCP server tools (`memory_create` tool)
   - Direct file manipulation

3. The transcript-collector should process transcripts:
   - From `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
   - Extract memories when explicitly triggered
   - Store in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`

This differs from the original design in CLAUDE.md which mentions a background daemon processing transcripts every 5 minutes.
