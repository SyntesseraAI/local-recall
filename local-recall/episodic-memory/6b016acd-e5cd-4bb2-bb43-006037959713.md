Transcript condensing using Claude Haiku is a preprocessing step that improves the quality of memory extraction. By condensing verbose transcripts into focused summaries, the semantic analysis becomes more accurate and extracts more meaningful memories. This is more efficient than analyzing full transcripts and reduces token usage.
