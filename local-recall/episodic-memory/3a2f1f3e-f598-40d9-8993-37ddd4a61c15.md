# Embedding and Vector Store Implementation

New modules are being developed to enhance memory search capabilities:

## Files Created
- `src/core/embedding.ts` - Handles text embedding using BGE-small-en-v1.5 model
- `src/core/vector-store.ts` - Manages semantic vector storage and retrieval

## Purpose

These modules enable semantic search in addition to keyword-based search, allowing the system to find contextually relevant memories even when exact keywords don't match.

## Integration

These will be integrated with the search module (`src/core/search.ts`) to provide comprehensive memory retrieval capabilities.
