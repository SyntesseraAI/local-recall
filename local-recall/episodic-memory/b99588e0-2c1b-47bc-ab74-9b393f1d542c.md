# Transcript Condensing Logic

The transcript condensing process extracts memories from Claude Code transcripts by:

1. **Parsing JSONL format**: Reads transcript entries line-by-line from `transcripts.jsonl`
2. **Extracting interactions**: Identifies user messages, assistant responses, and tool invocations
3. **Creating event format**: Converts to standardized format:
   - `[User]` - User's question or request
   - `[Assistant]` - Claude's explanation or response
   - `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, etc.)
   - `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool execution

This condensed format feeds into memory extraction to identify what was learned during the session.
