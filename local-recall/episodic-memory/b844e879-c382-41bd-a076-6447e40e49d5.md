Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The project folder name is derived from the working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes, prefixed with a dash.

Example: Working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` maps to `~/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in a `transcripts/` subdirectory within each project folder.
