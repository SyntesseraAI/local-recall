The vector store is SQLite-backed using better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings are generated using fastembed with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model. Search results use cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0-1.0 range, rounded to 2 decimal places), sorted descending. When scores are equal, memories are ranked by recency (occurred_at) as a tie-breaker. The store supports add, remove, search, and sync operations to keep it aligned with file-based memories.
