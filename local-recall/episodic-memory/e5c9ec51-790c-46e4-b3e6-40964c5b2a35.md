When extracting memories from transcripts, focus on:
- **Learned knowledge**: New insights and understanding gained
- **Codebase facts**: Important architecture, conventions, patterns
- **Problems solved**: Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- **Be specific**: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- **Be concise**: One concept per memory
- **Avoid**: Generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data, obvious facts
