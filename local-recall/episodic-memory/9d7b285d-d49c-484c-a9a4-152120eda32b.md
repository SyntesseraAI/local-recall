# Memory Extraction with Claude Haiku

The Local Recall system uses Claude Haiku as the LLM for extracting keywords from session transcripts.

## Process

1. Transcripts are collected from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
2. Transcript content is sent to Claude Haiku for processing
3. Haiku extracts relevant keywords from the transcript
4. Keywords are used to match against memory index for deduplication
5. New memories are created only if they don't already exist

## Implementation Details

- Uses `claude -p --model haiku` command for keyword extraction
- Processes entire transcripts to identify key concepts and discoveries
- Keywords help with fuzzy matching and memory deduplication
- The MCP server daemon runs this process every 5 minutes

## Rationale

- Haiku is efficient and cost-effective for keyword extraction
- Fast turnaround supports background processing
- Keeps memory creation independent of main Claude session
