# Memory Extraction Guidelines

## What to Extract

Focus on extracting:
- **Architectural decisions** and their reasoning
- **Bug fixes** with root cause analysis
- **Code patterns** specific to the project
- **Configuration quirks** and gotchas
- **User preferences** discovered during sessions
- **Component relationships** and dependencies
- **Performance considerations** and optimizations

## What NOT to Extract

Avoid extracting:
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Memory Characteristics

Extracted memories should be:
- **Specific**: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- **Concise**: Focus on one concept per memory
- **Actionable**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently

## Scope Guidelines

- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`)

## Output Format

Memories are stored as JSON with:
- `subject`: Brief one-line description (max 200 chars)
- `keywords`: Array of 1-10 searchable keywords (lowercase, specific)
- `applies_to`: Scope string
- `content`: Detailed markdown content
