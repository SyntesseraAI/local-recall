Embedding model details:
- Model: BGE-small-en-v1.5 (~133MB)
- Library: fastembed
- Cache location: `local_cache/` (auto-downloaded on first use)
- First run takes 30-60 seconds for download, then cached
- Configuration via environment variables or `.local-recall.json`

Common issue: Corrupted cache causes 'Tokenizer file not found' error. Fix: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to re-download.
