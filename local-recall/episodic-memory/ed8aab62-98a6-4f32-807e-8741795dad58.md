# User Preference: Absolute Paths for Memory Collection

When implementing transcript collection and memory extraction, use absolute paths instead of relative paths. This avoids issues with working directory changes and makes the system more robust.

## Context

The user emphasized using absolute paths when developing the transcript-collector and related memory extraction functionality. This is important for reliability when the MCP server or hooks might be running in different contexts.
