The memory-extractor.ts module implements a complete pipeline: it parses transcripts to extract events, generates keywords using Claude Haiku, creates memory objects with proper metadata (id, subject, content_hash), and checks for duplicates before storage. This multi-stage approach ensures quality and prevents redundant memories.
