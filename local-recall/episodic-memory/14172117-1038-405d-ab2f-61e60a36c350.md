The transcript condensing feature was successfully implemented to compress conversation transcripts for memory extraction. The condensing process:

- Condenses multi-line events like tool results into single-line format
- Preserves the event structure: `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, `[Result: OK/ERROR]`
- Uses string replacement to remove newlines within event content
- Maintains readability while reducing token count for memory extraction

This allows the transcript-to-memory extraction process (handled by transcript collector) to work with a more compact format suitable for Claude's prompt injection.
