Local Recall uses SQLite with sqlite-vec extension for vector embeddings. The BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) from fastembed is used for semantic search. Model is cached in `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`. Embeddings are lazy-initialized for performance - not used during SessionStart hook to avoid slow initialization on every session start.
