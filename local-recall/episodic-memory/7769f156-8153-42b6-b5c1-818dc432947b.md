Claude Code hooks are configured in hooks.json and use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` to reference scripts relative to the plugin installation directory. This allows hooks to work regardless of where the plugin is installed.

The hooks also receive `cwd` via stdin JSON input to operate on the user's project directory.
