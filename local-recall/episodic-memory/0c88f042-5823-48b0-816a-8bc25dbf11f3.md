The local-recall system maintains a searchable index at local-recall/index.json (gitignored) that caches all memory keywords for fast lookup. The index must be rebuilt when memories are added or deleted. The SessionStart hook loads this index to enable rapid keyword-based memory retrieval during new sessions.
