During the migration from sqlite-vec/fastembed to pure-JavaScript Orama, the HTTP daemon server (`src/mcp-server/http-server.ts`) was removed. This daemon architecture was designed to serialize access to native modules by having hooks call HTTP endpoints instead of loading native modules directly. The daemon approach would be ideal but was deleted during the refactor, necessitating the file-lock workaround instead.
