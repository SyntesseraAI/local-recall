The Stop hook is not being triggered in the VS Code extension, which prevents automatic memory creation. The memory creation logic is implemented in `src/hooks/stop.ts:77-108` which parses transcripts and creates memories, but this hook never fires in VS Code. This differs from Claude Code CLI which supports the Stop hook. As a workaround, memories can be created using MCP tools directly via `episodic_create` or the background daemon can process transcripts asynchronously.
