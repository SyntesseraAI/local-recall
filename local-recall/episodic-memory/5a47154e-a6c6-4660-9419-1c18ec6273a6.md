The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to process transcripts and extract memories. The system prompt is defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and guides the extraction process. Key files:
- `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` - Main extraction logic
- `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` - System prompt definition

This approach allows flexible, AI-powered memory extraction from session transcripts.
