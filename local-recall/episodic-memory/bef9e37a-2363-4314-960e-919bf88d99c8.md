Local Recall uses fastembed with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The model automatically downloads to local_cache/ on first use (~133MB). Initial startup takes 30-60 seconds for the download, but subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer.json file not found error occurs, the cache is corrupted and should be removed to allow automatic re-download.
