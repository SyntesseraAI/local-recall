The extraction prompt defines clear DO and DO NOT extract guidelines: DO extract architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, and user preferences. DO NOT extract generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, or sensitive data. Memories must be specific with file paths and function names, concise (one concept each), and actionable.
