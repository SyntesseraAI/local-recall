The memory extraction process in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API (via `claude-sdk`) to process transcripts and extract memories. It uses a structured prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to ensure consistent YAML frontmatter formatting. The extraction is idempotent - duplicate memories are detected and skipped based on `occurred_at` timestamp and `content_hash`.
