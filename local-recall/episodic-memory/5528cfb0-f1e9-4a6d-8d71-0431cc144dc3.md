Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files stored locally in the repository. The system has two main integration points: Claude Code hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop) and an MCP server that exposes memory tools. The project is installed as a plugin in `.claude/settings.json` and provides semantic search through vector embeddings using the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model.
