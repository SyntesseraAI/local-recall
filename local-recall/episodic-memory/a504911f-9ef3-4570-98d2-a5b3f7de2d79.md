Memories are deduplicated using two fields: `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp) and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix of 16 chars). The `findDuplicate()` method in memory manager checks for existing memories with matching hash and timestamp. This prevents duplicate memories from being created from the same transcript event.
