The memory extraction system uses the Claude API (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 model) to intelligently parse transcripts and extract valuable memories. Key implementation details:

- Uses `Anthropic` client from @anthropic-ai/sdk
- Calls `messages.create()` with structured prompt for extraction
- Handles transcript condensing before processing
- Includes error handling and logging via logger utility
- Extracts memories with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content fields
- Deduplicates memories based on content hash and occurred_at timestamp
