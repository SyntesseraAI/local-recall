# Memory Extraction Guidelines

## What to Extract
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

## What NOT to Extract
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

This ensures memories remain valuable and relevant over time.
