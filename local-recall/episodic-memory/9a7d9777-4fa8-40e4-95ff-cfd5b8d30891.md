# User Request Pattern: Extract Keywords

The user requested extraction of keywords from the provided text with specific output requirements:

- Return ONLY the keywords as a JSON array of strings
- No explanation or additional text
- No markdown formatting or code blocks
- Just raw JSON array

This is a common instruction pattern for structured data extraction tasks where the user wants minimal overhead and direct output.
