The project implements transcript condensing as a pre-processing step before memory extraction. This optimization reduces the amount of transcript data sent to Claude, thereby reducing token usage and API costs while maintaining the essential information needed for memory extraction. The condensed transcript uses a specific format with event markers like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]` to structure the session flow concisely.
