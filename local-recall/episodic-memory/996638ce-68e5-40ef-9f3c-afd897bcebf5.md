The memory-extractor.ts module is responsible for processing transcripts and extracting valuable memories. It uses the Claude API to analyze transcript content and determine what should be saved as memories. The module handles transcript parsing, calls the memory creation API, and manages the lifecycle of memory extraction from raw transcript data.
