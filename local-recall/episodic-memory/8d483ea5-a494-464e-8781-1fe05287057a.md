The UserPromptSubmit hook should support independent configuration for episodic and thinking memory searches. Each memory type should have its own:
- Maximum tokens to inject (`episodicMaxTokens` vs `thinkingMaxTokens`)
- Minimum similarity threshold (`episodicMinSimilarity` vs `thinkingMinSimilarity`)
- Enable/disable flags (`episodicEnabled` vs `thinkingEnabled`)

This allows fine-tuning the balance between memory types based on user preferences and token budgets. The configuration should be read from the merged config object and passed to separate search operations for each memory type.
