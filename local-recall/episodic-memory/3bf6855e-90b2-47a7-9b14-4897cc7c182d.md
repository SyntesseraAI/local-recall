# Keyword Extraction from Text

The user demonstrated a pattern of using keyword extraction to analyze text content. This shows that the local-recall system intends to support automatic keyword extraction from various sources (transcripts, code, documentation).

## Implementation Pattern

The request format was:
1. Provide text content to analyze
2. Request extraction of keywords
3. Return results as a JSON array of strings

This matches the pattern used in the `user-prompt-submit` hook which calls `claude -p --model haiku` to extract keywords from user prompts for searching memories.

## Relevance

This confirms that keyword extraction is a core pattern in local-recall for making content searchable without requiring manual keyword curation.
