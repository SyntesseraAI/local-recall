Thinking memories have been enhanced to capture both Claude's internal reasoning (thought blocks) and the corresponding text response together. This provides concrete examples of 'how I reasoned → what I produced' for future sessions.

Implementation details:
- Extraction combines thinking blocks with their corresponding text output in a single memory
- Tool-only responses are skipped (only memories with text output are saved)
- Memory format uses markdown sections: `## Thought` and `## Output`
- Subject line is derived from the first sentence of the thinking block

Benefit: Future sessions can see examples of reasoning that led to specific outputs, helping shape how Claude approaches similar problems.
