Transcript condensing is a preprocessing step that converts detailed Claude transcripts into summarized events. This involves:
1. Parsing JSONL transcript format from Claude's cache
2. Extracting and summarizing key interactions ([User], [Assistant], [Tool], [Result])
3. Using Claude Haiku (`claude -p`) to generate concise event summaries
4. Creating a condensed transcript format suitable for memory extraction

This condensed format becomes input for the memory extraction process, making it easier to identify and extract valuable memories from lengthy transcripts.
