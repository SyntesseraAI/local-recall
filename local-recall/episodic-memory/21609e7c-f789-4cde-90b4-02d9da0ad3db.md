# Claude Code Transcript Storage Location

Claude Code stores session transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` with the following naming convention:

- Directory name: URL-encoded absolute path with dashes instead of slashes
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `%2FUsers%2Fjoe%2FCode%2FSyntessera%2Flocal-recall`
- Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line)
- Each transcript line contains event data like user prompts, assistant responses, and tool invocations

This is important for the transcript-collector utility which needs to locate and parse these files to extract memories.
