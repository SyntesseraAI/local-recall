Local Recall uses `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use (~133MB, takes 30-60 seconds). Subsequent runs load from cache.

Common issue: If tokenizer file not found error occurs, the cache may be corrupted (usually from interrupted download). Fix by removing `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` - model will re-download on next run.
