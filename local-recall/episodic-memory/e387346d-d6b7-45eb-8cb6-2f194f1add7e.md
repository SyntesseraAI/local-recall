The memory directory has been refactored to use `local-recall/episodic-memory/` instead of `local-recall/memories/`. This naming convention better reflects the type of memories being stored (episodic/event-based rather than semantic). All code paths that reference the old 'memories' directory must be updated to use 'episodic-memory'.
