Local Recall uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). First run downloads and caches model in `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`. Initial startup takes 30-60 seconds due to download. Subsequent runs load from cache.

Common issue: If tokenizer.json is missing, the cache is corrupted (usually from interrupted download). Solution: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to force re-download on next run.
