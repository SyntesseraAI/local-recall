Memory extraction prompt logic is centralized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This:
- Keeps prompt engineering separate from extraction logic
- Makes it easier to iterate on and improve extraction quality
- Allows reuse of prompts across different extraction scenarios
- Follows a modular architecture pattern used in the project
