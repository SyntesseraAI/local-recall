Memory creation is idempotent via findDuplicate() check using occurred_at and content_hash fields. If a memory with the same occurred_at and content_hash already exists, the create operation returns the existing memory instead of creating a duplicate. The content_hash is a SHA-256 prefix (16 chars) of the memory content, used to detect when identical memories are created.
