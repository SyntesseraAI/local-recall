## Context

The SessionStart hook loads recent memories to provide context at the beginning of a coding session.

## Implementation Detail

Rather than using the full vector store search (which requires Orama indexing), the SessionStart hook reads memory files directly from disk and sorts them by `occurred_at` timestamp to get the most recent memories. This is more efficient for this use case because:

1. **No indexing overhead**: The full vector store doesn't need to be loaded just to get recent memories
2. **Simple sorting**: File system metadata and frontmatter parsing are faster than semantic search
3. **Clear recency**: `occurred_at` timestamp provides deterministic ordering
4. **Limited scope**: SessionStart only needs the 5 most recent memories, not a full search

This approach trades semantic relevance (from vector search) for performance and simplicity when the goal is just providing recent context.

## Code Location

`src/hooks/session-start.ts` - Loads 5 most recent memories by `occurred_at` timestamp directly from files.
