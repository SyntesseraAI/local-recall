When extracting memories:
- Be specific with file paths, function names, and concrete details
- Focus on one concept per memory
- Ensure memories help future assistants avoid mistakes or work efficiently
- Use appropriate scope: `global` for architecture/conventions, `file:<path>` for specific files, `area:<name>` for components
- Extract architectural decisions, bug fixes with root cause analysis, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, and component relationships
- Skip generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, trivial info, sensitive data, and outdated information
