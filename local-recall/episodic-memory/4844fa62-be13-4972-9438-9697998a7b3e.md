The memory extraction system prompt in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts instructs Claude how to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. The prompt likely:

1. Defines what constitutes a valuable memory vs. noise
2. Specifies the Memory object structure (subject, keywords, applies_to, content)
3. Guides keyword selection for searchability
4. Explains scope determination (global vs file-specific vs area-specific)
5. Provides examples of good vs. bad memories
6. Instructs Claude to ignore sensitive data, generic knowledge, and temporary debugging

This prompt is critical for ensuring extracted memories are high-quality and useful to future AI assistants.
