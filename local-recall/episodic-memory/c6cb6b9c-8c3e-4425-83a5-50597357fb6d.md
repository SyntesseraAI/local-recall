# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Slashes (/) are replaced with dashes (-)
- The full path becomes the folder name under `~/.claude/projects/`
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → folder name with dashes

## Transcript Files

Transcript files are stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) format:
- One JSON object per line
- Each line represents a single message/event in the session
- Files accumulate as the session progresses
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`

## Key Details

- The full absolute path is used to identify projects
- This location is where Claude Code caches all session transcripts
- Transcripts are machine-readable JSON format for programmatic access
- Project folders must be accessed by full path, not just project name
