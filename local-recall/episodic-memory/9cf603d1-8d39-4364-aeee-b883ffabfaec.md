# Memory Extraction Process

Memory extraction requires careful planning and a multi-step approach:

1. **Understanding Requirements**: The process involves understanding what memories should be extracted and how to identify them
2. **Implementation Planning**: Before coding, plan the extraction strategy
3. **Iterative Development**: Build incrementally, testing each component

Avoid jumping directly into implementation without understanding the full scope and requirements first.
