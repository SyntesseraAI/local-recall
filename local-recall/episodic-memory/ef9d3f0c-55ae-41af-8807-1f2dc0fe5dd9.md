Memory extraction happens in two contexts:
1. MCP server daemon - runs asynchronously every 5 minutes to process transcripts
2. Stop hook - can be triggered manually for immediate extraction

The system reads session transcripts, sends them through Claude Haiku with the extraction prompt, and creates memory files from the results. This decoupled approach prevents blocking user sessions while ensuring transcripts are processed for memory creation.
