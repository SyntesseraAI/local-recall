The vector store (src/core/vector-store.ts) uses better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension for semantic similarity search. Embeddings are generated using fastembed with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). The database file (local-recall/memory.sqlite) is gitignored. Search results use cosine distance similarity scores (0.0-1.0 range), rounded to 2 decimal places. Results are sorted by score descending with recency tie-breaker (more recent `occurred_at` ranked first).
