# Transcript Condensing Feature

A new feature has been implemented to condense/preprocess transcripts before extracting memories from them.

## Purpose

The transcript condensing reduces noise and irrelevant information from raw Claude transcripts, making the memory extraction process more efficient and focused.

## Integration

The condensing logic is integrated into the MCP server's transcript processing pipeline:
1. Raw transcript is read from Claude's cache
2. Transcript is condensed using `condenseTranscript()`
3. Condensed transcript is sent to `claude -p` for memory extraction
4. Results are stored as memory files

## Implementation Location

Logic resides in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` - this is the central point for transcript handling in the MCP server.

## Benefit

By condensing transcripts before sending them to Claude Haiku for memory extraction, we reduce token usage and focus the model on extracting only the most valuable memories.
