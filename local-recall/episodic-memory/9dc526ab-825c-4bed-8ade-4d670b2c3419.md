The memory extraction process includes deduplication logic that prevents storing duplicate memories:

- Uses `occurredAt` timestamp to identify when a memory event occurred
- Generates `contentHash` (SHA-256 prefix) of the memory content for change detection
- Checks for existing duplicates before creating new memories
- Implements idempotent memory creation - creating the same memory multiple times returns the existing one

This ensures that re-processing transcripts or multiple sessions analyzing the same information don't create duplicate memories in the system.
