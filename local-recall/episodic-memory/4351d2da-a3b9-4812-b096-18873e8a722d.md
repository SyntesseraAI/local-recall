Each memory file has an 'applies_to' field that determines its scope:
- `global`: Applies to the entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>`: Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>`: Related to a component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

This scope helps future assistants quickly filter memories relevant to their current task.
