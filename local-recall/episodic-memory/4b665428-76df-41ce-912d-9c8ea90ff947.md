The memory extraction logic uses a dedicated prompt file (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) to configure how Claude Haiku analyzes transcripts. This prompt file contains the detailed instructions and guidelines for:
- What constitutes a valuable memory
- How to structure extracted memories
- What to include or exclude from memories
- How to determine appropriate scope (global, file, or area)

Keeping the prompt in a separate file allows for easy maintenance and iteration of extraction logic.
