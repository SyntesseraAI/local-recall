The memory extraction pipeline first condenses the transcript using Claude's API before extracting memories. This condensing step removes verbosity and focuses on actionable events (User requests, Assistant responses, Tool invocations, Results). The condensed output becomes the input for memory extraction, improving signal-to-noise ratio.
