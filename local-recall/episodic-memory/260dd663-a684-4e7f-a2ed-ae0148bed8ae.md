The memory extraction process uses a carefully structured prompt that guides Claude Haiku on what makes a valuable memory, when to extract memories, and how to properly scope them. The prompt includes guidelines on being specific, concise, and actionable, and distinguishes between what should and should not be extracted as memories.
