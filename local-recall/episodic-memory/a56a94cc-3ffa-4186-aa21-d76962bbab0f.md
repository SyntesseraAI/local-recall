# Keyword Extraction from User Input

The user-prompt-submit hook extracts keywords from user input to improve memory search relevance.

## Current Implementation

The system uses Claude Haiku via CLI (`claude -p --model haiku`) to:
1. Analyze the user's prompt
2. Extract semantically relevant keywords
3. Use those keywords to search the memory index

## Important Consideration

This approach requires Claude Haiku access and may not work in all environments where only the SDK is available. If implementing keyword extraction:
- Provide fallback to simple keyword regex extraction (nouns, verbs)
- Consider making semantic extraction optional
- The CLI approach (`claude -p`) is preferred for better semantic understanding but is environment-dependent

This is a key part of how memories are surfaced to Claude in context.
