# Memory Files and Version Control

Memory files (stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/*.md`) ARE version-controlled and committed to git.

## Key Points

- Memory markdown files are tracked in git and should be committed
- The `local-recall/index.json` file is gitignored and auto-generated
- The `local-recall/recall.log` file is gitignored
- This allows memories to be shared among team members and preserved over time
- Memories represent learnings from past sessions that are meant to persist
