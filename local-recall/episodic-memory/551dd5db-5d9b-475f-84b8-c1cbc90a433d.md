The local-recall project uses a transcript condensing system to extract memories from Claude Code session transcripts. The memory extraction process is handled by the MemoryExtractor class which processes transcripts using Claude's API to identify and extract valuable memories that should be preserved for future sessions.

Key components:
- `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` - Main memory extraction logic
- `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` - Prompts used for memory extraction

The system analyzes session transcripts to identify:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and solutions
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- Important relationships between components

Memories are stored with metadata including subject, keywords, scope (applies_to), and content hash for deduplication.
