# Memory Extraction Keyword Extraction Process

The memory extraction system uses `claude -p` (Claude CLI with prompt caching) to extract keywords from transcript content.

## Key Implementation Details

- Uses `claude -p --model haiku` for fast, cost-effective keyword extraction
- Leverages prompt caching to improve performance for repeated analysis
- Keywords are extracted from transcript events to identify relevant memory subjects
- The extraction process is designed to be fast and efficient, processing sessions asynchronously

## Why This Approach

- Claude's language understanding is more effective than simple regex or keyword frequency analysis
- Haiku model provides good performance with minimal latency and cost
- Prompt caching reduces repeated processing overhead
