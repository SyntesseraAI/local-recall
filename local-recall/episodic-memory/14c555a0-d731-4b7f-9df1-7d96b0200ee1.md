# User Communication Preferences

## Emoji Usage

- **Default**: Do NOT use emojis in responses
- **Exception**: Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests them in the current session
- **Rationale**: Claude Code outputs to CLI, which renders in monospace font. Emojis can clutter output and make it harder to read in terminal contexts.

## Application

This preference applies to all interactions with the user, including:
- Regular code assistance
- Test output and logging
- Documentation and comments
- Memory extraction and retrieval

## Note

This is different from the project's commit messages (which use emoji indicators like 🤖), but applies to interactive communication with the user.
