Removed `IndexManager` and `index.json` (keyword index) after migrating to SQLite with vector embeddings. The old index.json-based approach was completely replaced by VectorStore which:
- Stores all memory metadata in SQLite database
- Provides semantic search via embeddings
- Eliminates need for manual index rebuilds

**Removed files:** `src/core/index.ts`, `tests/unit/core/index.test.ts`

**Updated:** Removed IndexManager imports from `src/mcp-server/tools.ts`, `src/hooks/stop.ts`, `src/core/memory-extractor.ts`, `src/index.ts`, and removed `index_rebuild` MCP tool.

**Tests:** Updated integration and unit tests to use VectorStore instead of IndexManager.
