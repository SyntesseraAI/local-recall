Extract memories that are: specific (include file paths, function names, details), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes). Include architectural decisions, bug fixes with root cause analysis, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, and performance optimizations. Exclude generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, trivial information, and sensitive data.
