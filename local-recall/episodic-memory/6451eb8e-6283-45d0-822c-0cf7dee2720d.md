# User Preference: Automatic Memory Extraction

The user wants memories to be extracted automatically from session transcripts as they occur.

## Implementation

This is handled by the MCP server background daemon (running every 5 minutes):
1. Syncs transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
2. Processes transcripts using Claude Haiku to extract memories
3. Creates memory files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
4. Deduplicates based on timestamp and content hash

The Stop hook was intentionally disabled in favor of this background daemon approach for better reliability and decoupling.
