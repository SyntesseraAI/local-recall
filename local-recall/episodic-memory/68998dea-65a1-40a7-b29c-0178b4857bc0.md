# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path to the project directory, encoded to be filesystem-safe. This encoding replaces special characters with underscores or other safe equivalents.

## Transcript Files

Within each project folder, transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line).

## Transcript Structure

Each transcript entry contains:
- `role`: Either "user" or "assistant"
- `content`: The message text
- `timestamp`: ISO-8601 timestamp of when the message was sent
- Other metadata fields as needed

## Use in local-recall

The transcript-collector component reads from this location to extract memories and context. This is essential for the background daemon and transcript processing features.
