The codebase separates transcript collection (reading from Claude's project cache) from memory extraction (analyzing transcripts to create memories). This separation allows:

- Transcript collection to run independently and populate a queue or log
- Memory extraction to process collected transcripts asynchronously
- Different scaling characteristics for collection vs extraction
- Flexibility to change extraction logic without affecting collection

The memory-extractor.ts handles the analysis phase after transcripts are collected. The background daemon mentioned in CLAUDE.md runs every 5 minutes to process transcripts asynchronously, implementing an event-driven architecture for memory creation.
