Recent work has added transcript condensing functionality (see commit 8c4fbf5) to improve memory extraction. This is handled by the transcript collector (`src/core/transcript-collector.ts`) which condenses transcripts before they are processed by the memory extractor. This condensing step helps extract more relevant and actionable memories from Claude Code sessions.
