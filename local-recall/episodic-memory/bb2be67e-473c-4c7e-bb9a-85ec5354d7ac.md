When thinking memories are injected into context via the UserPromptSubmit hook, they appear under a "Local Recall: Previous Thoughts" heading with similarity scores. During testing, multiple thinking excerpts appeared with 67% similarity scores, which suggests:

1. The similarity threshold filtering is working (default 0.5 or 50%)
2. Multiple thinking excerpts can relate to the same task at similar relevance levels
3. The thinking memory retrieval successfully finds related past reasoning patterns

This validates that the thinking memory system is correctly matching user queries to previous thought+output pairs from past sessions.
