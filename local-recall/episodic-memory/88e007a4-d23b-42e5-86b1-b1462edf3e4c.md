Local Recall uses the fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The model (~133MB) is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use, taking 30-60 seconds. Subsequent runs load from cache. If the cache becomes corrupted (usually from interrupted downloads), remove `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to trigger re-download.
