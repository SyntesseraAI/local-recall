Memory extraction from transcripts is a critical workflow in local-recall. During sessions, transcripts are collected. After sessions end or at intervals, the MCP server daemon processes these transcripts using the memory-extractor to identify and create new memories automatically. This enables the system to learn and improve context over time without manual intervention.
