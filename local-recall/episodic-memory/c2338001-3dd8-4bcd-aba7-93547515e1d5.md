# Local Recall MCP Server Async Processing

The Local Recall MCP server implements a background daemon that:
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
- Processes transcripts asynchronously using `claude -p` to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
- **Runs every 5 minutes** to process new and modified transcripts

This means there is a ~5 minute delay between transcript generation and memory extraction. The Stop hook is currently disabled in favor of this async approach.
