# Embedding Model Setup

## Model Details

Local Recall uses `fastembed` library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search and vector storage.

## Caching Behavior

- Model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use
- First run takes 30-60 seconds while model downloads
- Subsequent runs load from cache for fast initialization
- Cache location: `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`

## Troubleshooting

If encountering "Tokenizer file not found" error, the cache is corrupted. Delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and the model will re-download automatically.
