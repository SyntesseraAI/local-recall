Data enters the SQLite vector store through three pathways:

1. **On Memory Creation** (immediate): When `MemoryManager.createMemory()` is called, the memory is written to disk as markdown, then immediately added to the vector store via `vectorStore.add(memory)`, generating an embedding and inserting into both `memories` and `memory_embeddings` tables.

2. **During MCP Server Startup** (src/mcp-server/server.ts:73): `vectorStore.sync(memories)` reconciles the vector store with all memories from disk, adding missing ones and removing deleted ones.

3. **Via Search Engine** (src/core/search.ts): When memories are retrieved via search, they interact with the vector store's index.
