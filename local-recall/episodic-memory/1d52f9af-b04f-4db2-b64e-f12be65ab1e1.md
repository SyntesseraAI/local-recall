The memory extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` contains guidelines that instruct Claude what types of information to extract as memories:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Outdated information

Memories must specify scope using `applies_to`: `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`
