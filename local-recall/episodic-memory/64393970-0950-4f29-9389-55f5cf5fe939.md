When extracting memories from transcripts, it's more efficient to condense the full transcript into key events first (User actions, Assistant responses, Tool invocations) rather than trying to process the raw JSON directly.

Condensed format example:
- `[User]` - What the user asked or requested
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude said or explained  
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This condensing step:
- Reduces the amount of data to analyze
- Preserves the essential narrative of what happened
- Makes it easier to identify important discoveries and decisions
- Focuses on outcomes rather than implementation details
