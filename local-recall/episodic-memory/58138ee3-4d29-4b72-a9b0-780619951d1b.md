When setting up local-recall in a new repository, the transcript collector's debug-level logging doesn't show by default. Added INFO-level logging to make the search process visible:

1. Log when starting the search with the project path
2. Show whether the Claude projects directory exists
3. Report the expected folder pattern (-path-to-your-project)
4. Show transcript search results (found count or not found)
5. Report sync summary with counts of added/removed/skipped transcripts

This helps users understand what's happening during initial setup and troubleshoot if transcripts aren't being copied over.
