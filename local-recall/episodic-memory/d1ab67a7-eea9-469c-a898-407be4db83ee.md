The memory extraction prompt is a structured prompt that guides Claude to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. It defines what constitutes a good memory (specific, actionable, codebase-specific) and what should be excluded (generic knowledge, temporary debugging). The prompt helps Claude identify architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and project-specific conventions from session transcripts.
