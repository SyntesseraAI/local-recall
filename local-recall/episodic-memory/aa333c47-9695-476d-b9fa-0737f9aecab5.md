Claude stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` with URL-encoded directory names. The naming convention uses the full path with hyphens replacing slashes. Example: `/Users/joe/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/` contains transcript files.

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory. Each line is a JSON object representing a message event.

This is important for tools that need to access or monitor Claude's transcript history for memory extraction or analysis.
