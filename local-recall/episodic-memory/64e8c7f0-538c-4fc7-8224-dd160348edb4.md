The memory extraction process involves Claude analyzing session transcripts to identify valuable insights. This is a recursive/meta pattern where the system asks Claude to extract memories from transcripts, which Claude does by analyzing conversation flow, tool usage, and outcomes. The extraction focuses on architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and configuration quirks specific to the codebase.
