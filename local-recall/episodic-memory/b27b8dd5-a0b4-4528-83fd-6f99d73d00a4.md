# Claude Project Transcripts Storage Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path of the project:
- Path separators (`/`) are replaced with underscores (`_`)
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`
- The transcripts are stored in a `transcripts/` subdirectory within the project folder
- Each transcript is a JSONL file containing session events

## Discovery Context

This was discovered while implementing the transcript collector feature for the local-recall memory extraction system. Understanding this path structure is crucial for:
- Building the MCP server daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes
- Syncing transcripts from Claude's cache into the local-recall system
- Implementing content hash tracking for change detection

## Implementation Relevance

In `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`, this knowledge is used to:
1. Construct the correct path to Claude's transcript cache
2. Monitor for new or changed transcript files
3. Extract session events for memory creation via the MCP server daemon
