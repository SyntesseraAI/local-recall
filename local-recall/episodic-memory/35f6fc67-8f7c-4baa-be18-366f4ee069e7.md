The memory extractor (`src/core/memory-extractor.ts`) is a critical component designed to run in the background MCP server daemon. It processes condensed transcripts periodically (every 5 minutes per existing design) to extract and create memories. The system uses content hashes for deduplication and manages memory lifecycle (create/update/delete) based on transcript changes.
