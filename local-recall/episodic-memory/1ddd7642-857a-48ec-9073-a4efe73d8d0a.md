# Project Status: Memory Collection Refactor

Current branch: `claude/refactor-memory-collection-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`

## Recent Changes

The project is undergoing significant refactoring:

1. **New files added**:
   - `src/core/embedding.ts` - Embedding model integration
   - `src/core/vector-store.ts` - Vector storage for semantic search
   - `local-recall/` directory for memory storage

2. **Deleted files**:
   - `src/core/index.ts` - Being replaced with embedding-based search
   - `tests/unit/core/index.test.ts` - Corresponding test file

3. **Modified files**: Core memory system files being updated to support new architecture

## Purpose

The refactor is adding semantic search capabilities through embeddings, moving beyond simple keyword-based search.
