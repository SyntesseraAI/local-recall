# Keyword Extraction with Haiku Model

The Local Recall system uses Claude's Haiku model for extracting keywords from user prompts and transcripts.

## Usage in Hooks

The `user-prompt-submit` hook uses `claude -p --model haiku` to extract keywords from the user's prompt before searching the memory index. This allows fuzzy matching against memories with relevant keywords.

## Why Haiku?

- Fast and efficient
- Suitable for simple keyword extraction tasks
- Lower cost than larger models
- Meets the latency requirements of Claude Code hooks (timeout is 30 seconds)

## Implementation Note

The hooks interact with Claude via the command line (`claude -p`) which pipes JSON input to Claude's stdin. This is the preferred method for hook implementations to maintain simplicity and avoid complex subprocess management.
