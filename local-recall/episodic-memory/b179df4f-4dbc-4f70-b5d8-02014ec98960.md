The memory storage folder should be named 'episodic-memory' rather than 'memories'. This naming is more descriptive and specific to the type of memories being stored. Updated across:
- Core code: `src/core/memory.ts` and `src/core/index.ts` (folder path definitions)
- Tests: `tests/unit/core/memory.test.ts`
- Documentation: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/mcp-server.md`, `docs/architecture.md`

Note: The JSON schema property name `"memories"` (in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts:53`) remains unchanged as it refers to the array structure in LLM responses, not the folder path.
