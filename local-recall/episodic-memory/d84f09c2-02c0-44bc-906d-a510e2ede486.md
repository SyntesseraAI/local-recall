Memory markdown files stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` are version-controlled and committed to git. This enables:
- Team collaboration on shared codebase knowledge
- Historical tracking of when memories were discovered
- Code review of memory extraction logic

The `.gitignore` in `local-recall/` excludes:
- `memory.sqlite` - Vector store database (auto-generated)
- `recall.log` - Debug log file
- `local_cache/` - Embedding model cache (133MB)

Only markdown memory files and configuration are tracked in version control.
