# Transcript Collection and Memory Extraction

The MCP server daemon (running every 5 minutes) processes Claude transcripts to extract memories:

1. Reads `.jsonl` transcript files from `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`
2. Uses transcript condensing to summarize conversation history efficiently
3. Extracts keywords and creates memory files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
4. Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
5. Recreates memories when transcripts change

Transcripts use a condensed format where tool invocations are abbreviated to `[Tool: Name]` to reduce token usage during memory extraction.
