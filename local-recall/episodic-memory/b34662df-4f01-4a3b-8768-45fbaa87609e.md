The MCP server includes a background daemon that:
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
- Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
- Runs every 5 minutes

This allows memories to be extracted without slowing down the main Claude Code interface.
