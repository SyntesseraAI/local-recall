# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

Transcript files are JSONL format with names like `transcript_20250101_120000.jsonl`.

## Key Implementation Details

- Transcripts are located in the `transcripts/` subdirectory of the project folder
- Each transcript is a separate JSONL file
- The path conversion replaces `/` with `-` in the directory path
- This location is used by the MCP server to sync and process transcripts

## Relevance

This is critical for the transcript-collector and memory extraction features, as the MCP server needs to know where to find Claude's transcripts to process them and extract memories.
