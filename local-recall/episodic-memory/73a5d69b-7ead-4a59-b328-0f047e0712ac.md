The MCP server runs a background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously. It syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/), uses claude -p to extract memories, tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection, and runs every 5 minutes. The Stop hook is disabled in favor of this daemon approach.
