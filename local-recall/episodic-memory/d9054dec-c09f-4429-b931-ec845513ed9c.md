The vector store (`src/core/vector-store.ts`) uses better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for semantic search. It generates embeddings using fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB, cached in local_cache/). Search results use cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0-1.0), rounded to 2 decimal places, sorted by score descending with recency as tie-breaker. The database file memory.sqlite is gitignored and auto-generated.
