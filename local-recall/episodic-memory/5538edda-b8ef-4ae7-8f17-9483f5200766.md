# Keyword Selection for Memory Extraction

## Key Principles

1. **Include specific technical terms**: Always include actual class names, function names, file paths, and technical concepts that appear in the content
2. **Include broader contextual terms**: Include higher-level concepts that describe what the memory is about
3. **Include variation keywords**: Include both specific and general forms (e.g., "bug", "bugfix", "fixing bugs")
4. **Favor specificity in a memory-rich context**: When there are many similar memories, use more specific keywords to aid discoverability
5. **Avoid overly generic keywords**: Don't use keywords like "code", "fix", or "implement" alone without context

## Example Pattern

For a memory about fixing a bug in the search module:
- DO include: "search", "query", "filtering", "bug", "fuzzy-search", "index"
- DON'T include: "code", "bug", "issue" (without context)

## Strategy

When extracting keywords:
1. Identify the specific technical domain (e.g., search, memory, hooks)
2. List concrete elements (function/class names, file paths)
3. Describe the problem/solution category
4. Include any relevant libraries or technologies mentioned
