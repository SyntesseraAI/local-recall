A search of the test suite revealed there are currently no dedicated tests for mutex errors or concurrent access patterns (no files matching tests/**/*mutex* or tests/**/*concurrent*). This is a test coverage gap that should be addressed, especially given the known mutex issue with sqlite-vec initialization in the MCP server.
