# Memory Extraction System

Local Recall has a system to extract and store valuable memories from Claude Code session transcripts for future use.

## Key Concepts

- **Memory Format**: Structured markdown with YAML frontmatter containing metadata
- **Deduplication**: Uses `occurred_at` timestamp and `content_hash` to avoid duplicate memories
- **Keyword-based Search**: Memories are indexed by keywords for fast retrieval
- **Scope-aware**: Memories can be global, file-specific (`file:<path>`), or area-specific (`area:<name>`)

## Extraction Guidelines

Best memories to extract:
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during work
- Component relationships and dependencies
- Performance considerations or optimizations

Memories to avoid:
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Trivial or obvious information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Quickly-outdated information
