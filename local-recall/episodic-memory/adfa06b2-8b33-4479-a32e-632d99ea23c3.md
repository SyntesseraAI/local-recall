The memory extraction system is implemented in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` and uses a two-step process:

1. **Transcript Condensing**: Long transcripts are condensed into condensed event format before being sent to Claude for analysis. This reduces token usage and focuses Claude on extracting structured memories.

2. **Claude-Powered Extraction**: The condensed transcript is sent to Claude API (using `claude-opus-4-20250514` model) with a custom extraction prompt defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`.

3. **Structured Output**: Claude returns an array of memory objects with `subject`, `keywords`, `applies_to`, and `content` fields that are directly used to create memories.

This approach allows intelligent memory extraction that understands context and relationships between events in the session.
