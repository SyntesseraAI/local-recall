Claude stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/<project-id>/` on disk. The project directory name is derived from the repository path (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`). Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files where each line is a complete JSON object representing a single event in the session.
