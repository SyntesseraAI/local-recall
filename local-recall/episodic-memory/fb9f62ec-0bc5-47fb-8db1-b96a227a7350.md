Memory files are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory as markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Each memory file contains metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash) in the frontmatter and the actual memory content in markdown below. This format is version-controlled and allows memories to be shared across team members.
