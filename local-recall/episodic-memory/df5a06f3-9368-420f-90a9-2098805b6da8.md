Memory extraction prompts are kept in a separate module (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) rather than hardcoded in the extractor. This allows for:
- Easy modification of extraction behavior
- Reuse of prompts across different tools
- Version control of prompt changes
- Better testing and iteration
