The `MemoryExtractor` class in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` provides the main interface for extracting memories from transcripts:

1. Takes a transcript path or content as input
2. Calls Claude Haiku with the extraction prompt
3. Parses the JSON response into memory objects
4. Validates each memory to ensure required fields are present
5. Checks for duplicate memories to avoid duplication
6. Persists valid memories using the memory manager
7. Returns an array of created memory IDs

The class is designed to be robust with error handling for malformed responses and validation failures.
