Memory extraction is not a simple pattern-matching task. The extractor must understand semantic relationships between user messages, assistant responses, and tool invocations to identify what was learned or discovered. This is why the transcript condensing feature was implemented - it provides semantic summaries to Claude for intelligent memory extraction. The extractor should use Claude's language understanding (via the `claude -p` command) to generate contextually relevant memories rather than attempting to parse transcripts programmatically.
