# Claude Project Transcripts Path Resolution

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory on macOS.

## Folder Naming Convention

The project folder name is **not** the project name but a **hash of the project path**. For example:
- Project path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/[hash]/transcripts/`

## Path to Hash Conversion

The hash is derived from the project's working directory path. This means:
1. The same project always maps to the same hash
2. Different paths to the same project would have different hashes
3. This is consistent across sessions

## Implementation Note

When implementing transcript collection (`transcript-collector.ts`), use the project's working directory to generate or look up the correct hash to find transcripts. The hash generation likely uses a simple algorithm (MD5, SHA1, or similar) on the absolute path.
