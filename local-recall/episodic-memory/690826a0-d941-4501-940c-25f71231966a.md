Three hooks are configured in `hooks.json`:

1. **SessionStart**: Triggered when session begins
   - Loads all memories from disk (full reload)
   - Returns 5 most recent memories sorted by occurred_at
   - Outputs memory content to stdout for context injection

2. **UserPromptSubmit**: Triggered when user submits a prompt
   - Initializes vector store with lazy loading
   - Performs semantic search using embeddings
   - Outputs matching memories for context injection

3. **Stop**: Currently disabled
   - Memory extraction handled by MCP server daemon instead
   - Daemon processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes
