# Memory Extraction from Transcripts

Memory extraction is the process of analyzing session transcripts to automatically identify and organize valuable information into structured memory files.

## How It Works

1. **Transcript Collection**: Session transcripts are captured in JSONL format in `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/transcripts/`
2. **Parsing**: Transcripts are parsed to extract conversation events
3. **Analysis**: Claude (via MCP server) analyzes the transcript to identify learnings and insights
4. **Structuring**: Extracted information is organized with metadata (keywords, scope, timestamps)
5. **Storage**: Structured data is saved as markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`

## Benefits

- Automatically captures knowledge from each session without manual effort
- Ensures memories are properly structured with metadata
- Enables cross-session learning and context preservation
- Creates searchable repository of project insights

## Implementation

- Done via background MCP server daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes
- Uses content hashes to avoid reprocessing unchanged transcripts
- Idempotent: reprocessing same transcript with same content produces same memories
