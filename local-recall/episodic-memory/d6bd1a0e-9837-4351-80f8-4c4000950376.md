Three hooks integrate Local Recall with Claude Code: SessionStart loads 5 most recent memories on session begin, UserPromptSubmit performs semantic search before Claude processes user input, and Stop hook (currently disabled) extracted memories from transcripts. Hooks are configured in hooks.json and configured in .claude/settings.json.
