Memory files are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory with filenames based on memory IDs (typically UUID.md). The index file (`local-recall/index.json`) is gitignored but episodic-memory/*.md files are version-controlled. The system scans this directory to build the keyword index for searching.
