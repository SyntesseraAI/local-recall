# String Quote Standardization and Logging

The codebase has been standardized to use consistent string quotes and improved logging.

## Changes Applied

- Standardized string quotes across the codebase (specific dialect to be followed: use double quotes for consistency)
- Improved logging consistency in the user-prompt-submit hook
- These changes were applied in commit `5d8310f`

## Relevance

When making changes to the codebase, maintain these standards:
- Use consistent quote style across all files
- Ensure logging statements follow the established pattern
- This improves code readability and maintainability
