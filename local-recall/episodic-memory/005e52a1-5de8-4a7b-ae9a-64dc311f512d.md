# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Normalization

The project folder name is created by:
1. Taking the absolute working directory path
2. Replacing `/` with `_` to create a safe folder name
3. Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`

This is important when locating transcript files for memory extraction in the MCP server and hooks.
