The vector store uses SQLite's `sqlite-vec` extension for efficient vector similarity search. During initialization via `vectorStore.initialize()`, the extension must be loaded before creating the embedding tables. The store maintains two main tables:

- `memories`: Stores memory metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash, content)
- `memory_embeddings`: Stores embeddings and their vector similarity indices

Embeddings are generated using the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model, which is cached in `local_cache/` after first download.
