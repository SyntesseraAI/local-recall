The memory extraction prompt in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts provides detailed instructions to Claude for analyzing transcripts. It specifies what should be extracted (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks) and what should NOT be extracted (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data). The prompt ensures memories are specific, concise, actionable, and appropriately scoped (global, file-specific, or area-specific).
