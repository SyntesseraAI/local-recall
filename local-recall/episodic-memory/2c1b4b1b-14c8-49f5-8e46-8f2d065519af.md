# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `projects/ca76f3aee01d6e9c/`
- The hash appears to be derived from the full path

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the project folder:
- Each line is a JSON object representing a transcript event
- Files are named with timestamps (e.g., `20250101_1234.jsonl`)
- Multiple transcript files can exist for different sessions

## Key Insight

When implementing transcript collection or processing features, use the project hash to locate the correct transcript directory for the user's current working directory. This is essential for the MCP server's background daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes.
