The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude's API (via `@anthropic-sdk/sdk`) to process transcripts and extract memories. It uses streaming (`stream()` method) to handle responses efficiently, and includes error handling for API failures. The extracted memories are validated and deduplicated before being stored.
