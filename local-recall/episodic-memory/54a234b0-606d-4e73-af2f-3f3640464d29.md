Thinking memories capture Claude's internal reasoning paired with outputs. They are extracted asynchronously by the MCP daemon from transcripts (20 parallel workers), separate from episodic memories. Stored as markdown with 'Thought' and 'Output' sections. Can be disabled/reset by deleting `thinking-processed-log.jsonl` and `orama-thinking-index.json` to reprocess from scratch.
