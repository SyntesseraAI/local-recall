# Embedding Model Auto-Download

The codebase uses `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic vector search.

## Key Characteristics

- Model size: ~133MB
- Auto-downloads on first use to `local_cache/` directory
- First startup may take 30-60 seconds (one-time only)
- Subsequent runs load from local cache immediately

## Error Handling

If tokenizer file is not found at `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json`, it indicates a corrupted/incomplete cache (usually from interrupted download).

Fix: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to force re-download on next run.

## Location

Implementation is in new files:
- `src/core/embedding.ts` - Embedding generation
- `src/core/vector-store.ts` - Vector storage and semantic search
