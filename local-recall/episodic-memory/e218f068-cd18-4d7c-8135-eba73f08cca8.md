# Claude Project Transcripts Storage

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Forward slashes `/` are converted to dashes `-`
- The full path is used (including leading dashes from the first slash)
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) within the project folder:
- Path: `~/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`
- Each line is a valid JSON object representing one message/event
- Files contain the conversation history with timestamps and metadata

## Important Details

- The path conversion is deterministic, allowing consistent location lookups
- This is the source data for the transcript-collector component
- Transcripts are stored locally and can be processed to extract memories
- The `.jsonl` format allows streaming/line-by-line processing
