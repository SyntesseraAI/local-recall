Thinking memories capture Claude's internal reasoning paired with its actual output. Each thinking memory file contains:
- YAML frontmatter with metadata (id, subject, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash)
- A `## Thought` section with Claude's reasoning/thinking block
- An `## Output` section with the text response that followed

This format allows future sessions to see concrete examples of 'how I reasoned → what I produced' for similar tasks. Tool-only responses are skipped during extraction.
