Recent commits show a migration from individual .md files to a JSONL format for memory storage. The orama-episodic-index.json and orama-thinking-index.json are gitignored files that auto-generate. Memory files are stored as markdown in episodic-memory/ and thinking-memory/ directories and are version-controlled. The index files are regenerated when needed and should never be manually edited.
