When testing hooks, follow this sequence:
1. Verify that the TypeScript source has been compiled to the `dist/hooks/` directory
2. Confirm npm dependencies are installed (`node_modules/` exists)
3. Test hooks by piping JSON input via stdin to the compiled hook files
4. Both session-start and stop hooks are built to `dist/hooks/` after compilation
