The SessionStart hook is a full reload of all memories from disk via `MemoryManager.listMemories()` and returns the 5 most recent memories sorted by `occurred_at`. It deliberately does NOT use the vector store to avoid slow initialization on every session start. Vector store is only lazy-initialized on UserPromptSubmit hook.
