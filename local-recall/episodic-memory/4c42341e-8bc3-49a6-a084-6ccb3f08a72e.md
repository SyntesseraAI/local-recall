# User Preferences

## Coding Patterns

1. **Avoid unnecessary abstractions**: The user prefers simple, direct implementations over premature abstractions
2. **Keep solutions focused**: Don't add features beyond what was requested
3. **Delete unused code completely**: Rather than renaming with underscores or adding "removed" comments
4. **Trust framework guarantees**: Only validate at system boundaries, not for internal operations
5. **Minimal error handling**: Don't add fallbacks for impossible scenarios

## Development Practices

- Use TodoWrite tool frequently to track progress
- Mark todos as completed immediately after finishing
- Maintain one in_progress task at a time
- Use comprehensive tests and documentation for all features
