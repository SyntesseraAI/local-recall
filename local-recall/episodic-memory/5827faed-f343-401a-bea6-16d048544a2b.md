When using regex capture groups in TypeScript, even if the regex matches (making the array truthy), individual capture groups can be undefined if they didn't match. Use optional chaining syntax `codeBlockMatch?.[1]` instead of `codeBlockMatch[1]` to safely access potentially undefined capture groups and satisfy TypeScript's strict null checking.
