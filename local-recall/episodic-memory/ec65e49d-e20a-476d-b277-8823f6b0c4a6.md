The Stop hook is currently disabled. Instead, the MCP server runs a background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. The daemon syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/), tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection, and recreates memories when transcripts change.
