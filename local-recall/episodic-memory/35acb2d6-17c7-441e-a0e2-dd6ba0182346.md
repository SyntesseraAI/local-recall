Local Recall has transitioned to using Orama (pure JavaScript vector database) for semantic search instead of previous embedding approaches. This is a key architectural decision that affects how memories are indexed and retrieved. Orama provides vector storage and similarity search with no native dependencies, making it ideal for Claude Code hooks which need to run in isolated processes.
