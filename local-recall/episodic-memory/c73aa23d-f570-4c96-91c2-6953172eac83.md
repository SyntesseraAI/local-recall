The local-recall project is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. Recent work involved migrating memory storage from individual files to JSONL format with multi-file support (episodic-000001.jsonl, thinking-000001.jsonl). The system uses Orama for vector search with Ollama embeddings (nomic-embed-text model, 768 dimensions).
