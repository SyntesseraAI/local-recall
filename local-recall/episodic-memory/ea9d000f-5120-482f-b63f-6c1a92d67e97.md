The Stop hook is not being triggered in the Claude Code VS Code extension, preventing the automatic memory creation pipeline from working. The Stop hook in `src/hooks/stop.ts:77-108` is responsible for parsing transcripts and creating memories, but it never fires in VS Code.

This is a limitation of the VS Code extension - it may not support the Stop hook event, or only supports it in limited circumstances.

**Evidence:**
- `local-recall/recall.log` shows SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks firing but no Stop hook entries
- Memory creation relies entirely on the Stop hook being triggered

**Workarounds:**
- Use MCP tools directly (e.g., `episodic_create`) to create memories manually
- Use the MCP daemon which processes transcripts asynchronously
- File memories directly if needed
