The local-recall system uses a memory extractor module to analyze session transcripts and automatically generate structured memories. This process involves:

1. **Transcript Processing**: Takes condensed transcript events and analyzes them
2. **Claude API Integration**: Uses Claude Haiku to understand context and extract meaningful insights
3. **Memory Generation**: Creates structured memory objects with metadata (subject, keywords, scope)
4. **Deduplication**: Checks for duplicate memories using content hash and occurred_at timestamp

This workflow enables automatic knowledge retention across sessions without manual memory creation.
