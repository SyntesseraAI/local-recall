# User Workflow Preference

User explicitly stated they prefer not to use interactive git commands like `git rebase -i` in their Claude Code workflow.

## Implementation Impact

When implementing git-based features or utilities in this codebase:
- Avoid suggesting or using interactive git commands
- Provide non-interactive alternatives
- Keep git operations scripted and automated
- This aligns with the Claude Code limitation where interactive input is not supported
