Both `src/core/memory.ts` and `src/core/index.ts` had identical gitignore creation logic. This was extracted into a shared utility function `ensureGitignore(baseDir)` in `src/utils/gitignore.ts`. Both files now import and call this function instead of duplicating the logic. This is a DRY principle application for file management utilities.
