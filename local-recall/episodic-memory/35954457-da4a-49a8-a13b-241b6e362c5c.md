# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line) with the naming convention `transcript-<timestamp>.jsonl`. Each JSON object represents a single turn in the conversation.

## Key Insight

The path format is deterministic and can be calculated from the working directory, which is useful for implementing transcript collection functionality that reads from Claude's transcript cache.
