The extraction prompt file defines how Claude should analyze transcripts and extract memories. It provides guidelines including: extracting specific architectural decisions, bug fixes with root causes, code patterns unique to the project, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, and performance considerations. It explicitly warns against extracting generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, or sensitive data. The prompt emphasizes specificity, conciseness, and actionability.
