Local Recall's memory extraction system processes Claude Code session transcripts to capture valuable knowledge. The system analyzes conversations to identify:

- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations and optimizations

Memories should be specific (with file paths and function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (helping future assistants avoid mistakes). The system uses scope indicators to categorize memories as `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>` to determine where the information applies.

Generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, and sensitive data should NOT be extracted as memories.
