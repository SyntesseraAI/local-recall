Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The project folder name is derived from the working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes, prefixed with a dash.

Example: Working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` maps to `~/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with the format `transcript-[number].jsonl` (e.g., `transcript-1.jsonl`, `transcript-2.jsonl`). Each line is a JSON object representing a single transcript event.

This is relevant for the transcript-collector in local-recall which needs to sync transcripts from Claude's cache directory.
