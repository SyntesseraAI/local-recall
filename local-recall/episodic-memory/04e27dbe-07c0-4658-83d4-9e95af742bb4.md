# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

When extracting memories from full transcripts, condensing is beneficial for efficiency.

## Why Condense

1. **Token efficiency**: Full transcripts can be very large, condensing reduces token usage when processing
2. **Focus**: Removes verbose exchanges and keeps only essential events
3. **Clarity**: Condensed format is easier for memory extraction algorithms to parse

## Condensing Strategy

Convert full transcript events into a simplified format:
- `[User]` - What the user asked or requested
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude said or explained  
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

## Implementation Details

See `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` for the implementation of transcript condensing logic. The condensing process:
1. Iterates through transcript turns
2. Filters for relevant events (user/assistant messages, tool calls)
3. Summarizes verbose content while preserving essential information
4. Outputs in the simplified format for memory extraction
