The memory-extractor.ts module uses the Anthropic Claude API to analyze transcripts and extract memories. It implements streaming responses for efficient processing of large transcripts. The extractor reads condensed transcript events and uses a structured prompt to identify valuable memories.

Key implementation details:
- Uses `Anthropic` client from the SDK
- Implements streaming with `stream()` method
- Processes transcript events in structured format
- Returns memories with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content
