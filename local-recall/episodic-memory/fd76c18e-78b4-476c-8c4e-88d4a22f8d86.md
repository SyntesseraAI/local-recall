# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

Project folders use the absolute working directory path with forward slashes as separators:
- Working dir: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/`
- Transcripts folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) where each line is a separate JSON object representing an event in the session.

## Relevance

This is critical for the local-recall MCP server which syncs transcripts to extract memories. The background daemon needs to know where to find transcript files to process them.
