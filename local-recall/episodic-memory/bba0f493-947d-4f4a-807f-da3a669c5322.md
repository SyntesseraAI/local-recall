The MemoryExtractor class in src/core/memory-extractor.ts uses Claude Haiku model (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001) for extracting memories from session transcripts. This choice prioritizes cost efficiency while maintaining adequate quality for memory extraction tasks. The extractor processes transcripts asynchronously and handles rate limiting through exponential backoff retry logic.
