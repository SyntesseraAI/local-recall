The transcript parsing in memory extraction removes `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` markers and their associated instruction blocks before sending transcripts to Claude for analysis. This ensures that the system's internal instructions don't contaminate the memory extraction process and that extracted memories focus on actual session content.
