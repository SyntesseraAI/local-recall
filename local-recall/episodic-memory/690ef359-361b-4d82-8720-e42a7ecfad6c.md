The MemoryExtractor class in src/core/memory-extractor.ts uses the Anthropic Claude API to extract structured memories from session transcripts. Key implementation details:

- Uses `Anthropic` client from `@anthropic-ai/sdk`
- Implements streaming with `stream()` method for real-time output
- Processes transcripts through memory extraction prompts
- Handles both streaming and non-streaming extraction modes
- Uses the prompt templates from src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts
- Extracts memories with metadata including subject, keywords, and scope
- Integrates with the broader memory management pipeline for transcript processing
