The MCP server runs a background daemon that continuously processes transcripts from Claude's cache directory. The daemon runs every 5 minutes, detects transcript changes using content hashes, and invokes memory extraction. This allows the Stop hook to be disabled while still extracting memories from completed sessions asynchronously.
