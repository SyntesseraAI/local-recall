The memory extractor module uses the Claude API to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. It uses a system prompt and user prompt structure to guide Claude in identifying important information from session transcripts. The extraction process is designed to find architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and project-specific knowledge that would be useful for future AI assistants.
