Thinking memories capture Claude's internal reasoning (thinking blocks) paired with corresponding text outputs. The extraction process:

- Processes transcripts to identify `<thinking>` tags and their corresponding outputs
- Creates memory pairs: thought + output
- Skips tool-only responses (those without text outputs)
- Uses parallel processing (20 concurrent extractors) for performance
- Tracks processed transcripts to avoid reprocessing

Thinking memories provide examples of "how I reasoned → what I produced" for future sessions, improving contextual decisions.
