Thinking memory tables are recreated automatically via CreateTable IF NOT EXISTS. If you delete memory.sqlite and the thinking-processed-log.jsonl, the next daemon run will recreate both automatically. ProcessedLog.load() gracefully handles ENOENT errors and starts fresh. This allows resetting thinking memories by simply deleting the processed log and memory files without manual database recreation.
