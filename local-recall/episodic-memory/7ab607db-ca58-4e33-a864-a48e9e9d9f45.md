# Memory Extraction Keywords

When extracting keywords from memory extraction tasks, include metadata about the extraction process itself:
- Tool names used (e.g., 'grep', 'edit', 'read')
- File paths being analyzed
- Project context indicators (working directory, project name)
- Transcript format details (events, structure, tool invocations)
- Task type (extraction, analysis, refactoring, debugging)

This helps future transcripts find relevant memories about similar extraction tasks and debugging approaches.
