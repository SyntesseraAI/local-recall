Initial suggestion of a shared daemon per MCP server was rejected because user needs to run multiple Claude instances concurrently. Each Claude instance would still need its own daemon, which brings back the ONNX mutex problem. Ollama solves this by being a single system-level daemon that supports unlimited concurrent clients via HTTP API without needing separate instances.
