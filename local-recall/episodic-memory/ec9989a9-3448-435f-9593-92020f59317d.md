The vector store (`src/core/vector-store.ts`) uses better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search. Search results use cosine distance similarity scores (0.0 to 1.0, rounded to 2 decimal places). Results are sorted by score descending with recency tie-breaker: when scores are equal, more recent memories (`occurred_at`) are ranked first. The store has methods: `initialize()`, `add(memory)`, `remove(id)`, `search(query, options)`, `sync(memories)`.
