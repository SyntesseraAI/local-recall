# New Embedding and Vector Store Modules

Two new files have been added to the codebase:
- `src/core/embedding.ts` - Handles semantic embedding of memory content
- `src/core/vector-store.ts` - Manages vector storage and similarity search

These modules are part of a new feature for semantic search capabilities (in addition to the existing fuzzy keyword search). They represent an expansion of the search functionality to support vector-based similarity matching.

## Important Context

These are brand new modules and likely need:
- Documentation in the CLAUDE.md file
- Integration tests
- Connection to the search pipeline
- Proper error handling and validation
