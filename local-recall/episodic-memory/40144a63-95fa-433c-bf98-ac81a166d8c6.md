Memory extraction prompts are defined separately in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to keep prompt templates centralized and maintainable. This separation allows:
- Easy modification of prompts without touching the extraction logic
- Reusability of prompts across different extraction functions
- Clear separation of concerns between prompts and implementation
