# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with forward slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Stored at: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) files, one per Claude Code session.

Each transcript file contains sequential events:
- User messages
- Assistant responses
- Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Bash, etc.)
- Tool results

This is used by the transcript-collector to load and parse session history for memory extraction.
