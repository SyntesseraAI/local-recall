Memory extraction instructions are stored in a dedicated prompt file at `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This centralizes the memory extraction logic and makes it easy to refine the extraction quality by modifying the prompt without changing the extraction implementation.

This pattern follows good separation of concerns - the extractor handles the mechanics, the prompt handles the intelligence.
