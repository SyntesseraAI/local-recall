# Memory Extraction Strategy

When extracting memories from session transcripts:

1. **Focus on actionable insights** - Extract what was learned, discovered, or resolved that will help future sessions
2. **Condense transcript data** - Don't include raw transcript content in memories, summarize the insights
3. **Include specific details** - File paths, function names, error messages help with future lookup
4. **Consider scope carefully** - Use `file:` or `area:` scope when specific to a component, `global` for project-wide learnings
5. **Avoid duplicates** - Check for duplicate memories by content hash to prevent redundant entries

## Key Insight

The goal is to extract memories that help future AI assistants understand the codebase better and avoid repeating the same investigation or debugging process.
