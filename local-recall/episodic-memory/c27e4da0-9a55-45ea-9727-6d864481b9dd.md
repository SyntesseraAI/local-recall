# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts in the user's home directory at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Structure

Each project has a folder name derived from hashing its absolute path:
- Project folder: Hash of the project's absolute path (e.g., `01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`)
- Transcripts stored in: `~/.claude/projects/{project-id}/transcripts/`
- Format: `.jsonl` files (newline-delimited JSON)

## Example

For project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`:
- Project ID: `01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u` (hash of full path)
- Transcripts location: `~/.claude/projects/01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u/transcripts/`
- Files: `.jsonl` format with one event per line

## Key Details

- Path conversion handles both absolute paths and relative paths
- The transcript collector needs to compute the project ID from the current working directory (cwd)
- Each transcript file contains a session's events in JSONL format
- This is important for the memory extraction system that syncs transcripts from this location
