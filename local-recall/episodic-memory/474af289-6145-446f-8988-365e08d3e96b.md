The memory extraction workflow follows this pattern:
1. Read transcript files from Claude's cache
2. Send transcript content to Claude API with extraction prompt
3. Stream the response back to avoid blocking
4. Parse streaming response to create memory files
5. Handle errors and edge cases gracefully

This is used by the MCP server daemon to asynchronously extract memories every 5 minutes.
