Claude stores projects in ~/.claude/projects using a naming convention where the full filesystem path has slashes replaced with dashes. For example, /Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall becomes -Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall. The TranscriptCollector now prioritizes this naming convention when searching for the Claude project directory. Transcripts are stored directly in the project folder, not in a transcripts subfolder.
