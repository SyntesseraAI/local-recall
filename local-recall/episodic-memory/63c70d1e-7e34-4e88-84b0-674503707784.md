The LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL system extracts memories from Claude Code session transcripts to help future assistants. Memories should be specific, actionable, and focused on learnings that prevent mistakes or improve efficiency. Extract architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configurations, and component relationships. Avoid generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, or sensitive data.
