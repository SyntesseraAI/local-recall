Thinking memories capture Claude's internal reasoning paired with its text response, providing "how I thought → what I produced" precedents:

- Format: Two sections in one markdown file - `## Thought` and `## Output`
- Extraction: Daemon pulls thinking blocks from transcripts along with corresponding text outputs
- Tool-only responses are skipped (no thinking block needed)
- Storage: Each thought+output pair = 1 thinking memory file
- Retrieval: Semantic search returns relevant thinking memories with similarity scores
- Injection: Context shows previous thoughts as examples for similar tasks
- Reset: Delete `thinking-processed-log.jsonl`, `orama-thinking-index.json`, and `thinking-memory/` directory to reprocess
