Memory extraction doesn't happen in real-time during sessions. Instead, the MCP server runs a background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously. This daemon syncs transcripts from Claude's cache and uses the memory extractor to identify and create memories periodically (every 5 minutes). This design prevents blocking the user's current session.
