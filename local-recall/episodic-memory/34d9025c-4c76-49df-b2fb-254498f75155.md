Two main hooks integrate memories into Claude Code: SessionStart loads the index and retrieves relevant memories on session begin; UserPromptSubmit searches memories based on the user's prompt keywords before Claude processes it. Both hooks output memory content to stdout for context injection. The Stop hook is disabled; memory extraction is handled asynchronously by the MCP server daemon every 5 minutes.
