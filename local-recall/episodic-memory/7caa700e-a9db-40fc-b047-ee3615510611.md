Local Recall follows Claude Code's plugin format with project root as plugin root. Structure includes .claude-plugin/plugin.json (metadata), hooks.json (hook handlers), .mcp.json (MCP config), and scripts/ (bundled executables). Hooks use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} to reference scripts and receive cwd via stdin to operate on user's project directory.
