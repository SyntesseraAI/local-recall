The memory extraction system was simplified to save all messages from transcripts without any filtering or pattern matching.

**Changes made:**
- Removed `USER_TRIGGER_PATTERNS` regex (was matching phrases like 'remember this', 'save this for later', 'don't forget')
- Removed `AUTO_DETECT_PATTERNS` heuristics (was detecting architecture decisions, bugfixes, discoveries, conventions)
- Simplified `analyzeForMemories()` to iterate over all messages and save each one
- Messages are prefixed with `**user**:` or `**assistant**:` role indicators
- Empty messages are skipped

**Rationale:** User preference to capture full context without intelligent filtering - all messages are now treated as valuable memory content.
