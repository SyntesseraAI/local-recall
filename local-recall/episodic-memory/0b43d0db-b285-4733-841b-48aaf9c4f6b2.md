The local-recall plugin uses a skills-based architecture for exposing functionality. Version 0.1.3 introduced two new skills: `check-memories` and `proactive-recall`. MCP tool descriptions were enhanced with usage guidance to improve discoverability. Plugin metadata is maintained for better integration with the dev marketplace. Skills are stored in `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/skills/` directory.
