The MemoryExtractor class (located in src/core/memory-extractor.ts) is responsible for:
1. Taking a transcript as input (from transcript-collector)
2. Using Claude Haiku to analyze the transcript and extract memories
3. Calling the memory creation system to persist the extracted memories

The class integrates the prompt from memory-extraction.ts with the Claude API to generate structured memory outputs that conform to the local-recall memory format.
