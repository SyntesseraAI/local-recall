# Claude Project Transcripts Storage

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Slashes (/) are replaced with dashes (-)
- The full path is encoded in the folder name
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes a folder under `~/.claude/projects/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (JSON Lines format):
- Each line is a complete JSON object
- Can be parsed line-by-line without loading entire file into memory
- Files update as the session progresses
- Each event includes timestamp and type information

## Implementation Notes

When collecting transcripts for memory extraction:
1. Construct the path using the working directory with slashes replaced by dashes
2. Look in `~/.claude/projects/` for the computed folder name
3. Parse JSONL files line-by-line for robustness
4. Handle the fact that files are actively written to during sessions
