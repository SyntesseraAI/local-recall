Transcripts are condensed into events for memory extraction: [User] for user requests, [Assistant] for Claude responses, [Tool: Name] for tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.), and [Result: OK/ERROR] for outcomes. This format provides a structured representation of the session that Claude Haiku can efficiently analyze to extract memories.
