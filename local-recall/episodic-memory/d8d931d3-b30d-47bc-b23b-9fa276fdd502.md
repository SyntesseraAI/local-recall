Local Recall uses fastembed with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search:

- **First Run**: Initial startup takes 30-60 seconds as the model downloads to `local_cache/`
- **Subsequent Runs**: Loads from cache immediately
- **Cache Location**: `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`
- **Troubleshooting**: If getting 'Tokenizer file not found' error, the cache may be corrupted from interrupted download. Remove `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and let it re-download.

This trade-off (slow first startup, fast subsequent runs) is acceptable for local development and sessions.
