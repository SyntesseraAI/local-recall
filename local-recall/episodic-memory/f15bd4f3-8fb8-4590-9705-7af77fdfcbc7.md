Memories use three scope levels in the `applies_to` field:
- `global` - Applies to the entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

This scope classification enables efficient retrieval and ensures memories are only presented when relevant to the current context.
