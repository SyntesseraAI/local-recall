# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes folder name `_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format), one event per line. Each event contains:
- Event type (user message, assistant response, tool calls, etc.)
- Timestamp
- Content

This naming convention is important for tools that need to locate and process project transcripts programmatically.
