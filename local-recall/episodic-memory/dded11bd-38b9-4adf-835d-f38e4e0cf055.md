The IndexManager class (in-memory JSON index with keyword lookups) was fully redundant after migrating to sqlite-vec. Removed: src/core/index.ts, index_rebuild MCP tool, IndexManager.refreshIndex() calls from hooks/stop.ts and memory-extractor.ts. Vector store sync() now handles index updates. Updated tests to use vector store instead. All 259 tests pass.
