Each memory file is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing: `id` (UUID), `subject` (brief description), `keywords` (searchable terms array), `applies_to` (scope), `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp), and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix for deduplication). This metadata enables the search, filtering, and deduplication systems to work correctly.
