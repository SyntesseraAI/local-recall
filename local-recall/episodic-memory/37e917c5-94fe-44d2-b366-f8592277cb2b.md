# User Preferences for Memory Extraction

## Memory Extraction Guidelines

The user wants memories to:
1. Be **specific** - Include file paths, function names, and concrete details
2. Be **concise** - Focus on one concept per memory
3. Be **actionable** - Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work efficiently
4. Use appropriate scope:
   - `global` - Entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
   - `file:<path>` - Specific to a file
   - `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area

## What to Extract

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions
- Configuration quirks
- User preferences
- Component relationships
- Performance considerations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Quickly outdated information

## Output Format

Return only valid JSON with a "memories" array. Each memory has:
- `subject`: Brief one-line description (max 200 chars)
- `keywords`: Array of 1-10 searchable keywords (lowercase, specific)
- `applies_to`: Scope string
- `content`: Detailed markdown content
