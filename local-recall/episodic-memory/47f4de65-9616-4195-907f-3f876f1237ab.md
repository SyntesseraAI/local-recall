The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku via the `claude -p` command to process transcripts and extract memories. The extraction uses structured system prompts defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide the model in identifying valuable memories. The extracted memories are parsed and validated before being stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory.
