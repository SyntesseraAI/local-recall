When a Claude Code session ends, the Stop hook is triggered, which processes the session transcript to extract valuable memories. This occurs asynchronously (or via background daemon) to avoid blocking the user's workflow. The extraction uses both automated keyword detection and structured prompts to determine what should be remembered.
