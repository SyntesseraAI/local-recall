Memory scoping allows targeting memories to specific contexts:

- **global**: Applies to entire codebase (architecture decisions, conventions, preferences)
- **file:<path>**: Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- **area:<name>**: Related to a component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

This enables context-aware memory retrieval where SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks can return only relevant memories based on where the user is working.
