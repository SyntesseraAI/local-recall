Configuration management:

- Central configuration file at `src/utils/config.ts`
- Configuration can be loaded from:
  - Environment variables
  - `.local-recall.json` file in the project root
  - Hardcoded defaults
- Includes `maxMemories` setting for memory limit (though enforcement is unclear)
- Configuration is used by hooks and MCP server to control behavior (e.g., which memories to search, token budgets)
