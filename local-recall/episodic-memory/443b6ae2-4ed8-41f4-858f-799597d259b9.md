Local Recall is a memory system designed for Claude Code and MCP clients to maintain persistent context across sessions. Key architectural points:

- Memories stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
- Memory files ARE version-controlled (git-tracked)
- Index (`index.json`) is gitignored and auto-generated
- Plugin integrates via hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop)
- MCP server provides memory tools for any compatible client
- Uses fuzzy search to find relevant memories by keywords
- Memories are idempotent (create returns existing if duplicate)
- Background daemon processes transcripts every 5 minutes

Memory metadata includes: id (UUID), subject, keywords, applies_to scope, occurred_at timestamp, content_hash for deduplication
