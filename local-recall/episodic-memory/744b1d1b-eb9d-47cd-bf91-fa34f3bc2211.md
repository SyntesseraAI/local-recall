The Claude Haiku 4.5 model used in Claude Code sessions has a 5-hour equivalent token budget limit that resets daily at 1am Europe/London time. When this limit is reached, further work requires waiting for the reset or using a different model.

This is a hard constraint that affects development workflows and task planning.
