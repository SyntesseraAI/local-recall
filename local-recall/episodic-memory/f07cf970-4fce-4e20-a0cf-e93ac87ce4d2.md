# Keyword Extraction with Claude Haiku

The `user-prompt-submit` hook extracts searchable keywords from user prompts to find relevant memories.

## Implementation Details

- Uses `claude -p --model haiku` command to process prompts
- Claude Haiku is chosen for speed and cost-efficiency (it's the smaller, faster model)
- The hook submits the user's prompt and receives a list of relevant keywords
- These keywords are then used for fuzzy matching against the memory index

## Why Haiku?

Haiku is ideal for this lightweight keyword extraction task because:
- Fast execution (important for hook latency)
- Lower token consumption
- Sufficient capability for keyword extraction
- Cost-effective
