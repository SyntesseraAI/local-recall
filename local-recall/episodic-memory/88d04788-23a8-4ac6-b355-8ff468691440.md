The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku as the AI model for generating memories from transcripts. Haiku is chosen for its cost-effectiveness compared to larger models while still being capable of understanding context and extracting meaningful memories. This is a deliberate architectural choice to keep the memory extraction process efficient.
