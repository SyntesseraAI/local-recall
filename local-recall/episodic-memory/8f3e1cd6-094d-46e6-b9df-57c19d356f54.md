The memory extraction system prevents duplicate memories by using a combination of `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix) and `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp) fields. The `findDuplicate()` method checks for existing memories with matching hash and timestamp before creating new ones, ensuring the memory creation process is idempotent.
