# Transcript Collector Implementation

The `transcript-collector.ts` module is responsible for reading transcripts from Claude Code's cache.

## Key Functionality

- Reads `.jsonl` files from `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`
- Project folder name derived from working directory path (slashes replaced with dashes)
- Parses JSON Lines format where each line is a complete transcript event
- Used by the MCP server daemon to process transcripts asynchronously

## Current Status

This module may need updates to properly handle the transcript format and ensure correct path resolution for different operating systems and project structures.
