# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Slashes are replaced with dashes
- The result becomes the folder name under `~/.claude/projects/`
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## Transcript Files

Transcript files are stored as JSONL format in `transcripts/` subdirectory:
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/{project-folder}/transcripts/`
- Files: `*.jsonl` (JSON Lines format)
- Each line is a complete JSON object representing one transcript event

## Important for Development

When implementing transcript collection or syncing:
1. Replace slashes with dashes in the working directory path to find the transcript location
2. Access transcripts from the `transcripts/` subdirectory
3. Parse JSONL format - read line by line, each line is a separate JSON object
4. Account for this path-based naming when matching projects
