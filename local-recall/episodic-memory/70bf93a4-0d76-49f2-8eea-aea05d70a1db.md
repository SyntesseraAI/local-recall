# Memory Condensing for Token Efficiency

Transcript condensing is implemented to reduce token usage when processing transcripts for memory extraction.

## Implementation

- Transcripts can contain extensive tool usage, context, and intermediate steps
- Memory condensing creates a summary of key events before sending to Claude for keyword extraction
- This reduces the number of tokens sent to the model while preserving important information

## Benefit

Reduces costs and processing time when the MCP daemon extracts memories from transcripts, especially for longer sessions with multiple tool invocations.
