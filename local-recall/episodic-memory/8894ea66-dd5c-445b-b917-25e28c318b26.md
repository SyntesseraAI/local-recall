The vector store uses better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search using cosine distance. Embeddings are generated with fastembed using the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). Scores range from 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (identical), rounded to 2 decimal places. When scores are equal, recency (occurred_at) is used as a tie-breaker.
