The memory-extractor module uses the Anthropic Claude API to process transcripts and extract valuable memories. It sends transcripts to Claude with a carefully designed system prompt that instructs the model to identify memories based on architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration details, and important relationships. The extraction process is designed to avoid including generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, or trivial information. Results are parsed from Claude's response and validated before being returned.
