## Vector Store for Semantic Memory Search

Local Recall implements a vector store for semantic search capabilities to find memories based on semantic similarity, not just keyword matching.

### Architecture

- **File location**: `src/core/vector-store.ts`
- **Purpose**: Store and retrieve memory embeddings for semantic search
- **Embedding model**: BGE-small-en-v1.5 via fastembed
- **Index format**: Stores memory IDs with their vector embeddings

### Key Features

1. **Embedding generation**: Converts memory content into vector embeddings
2. **Similarity search**: Finds memories semantically similar to a query
3. **Index persistence**: Stores embeddings locally for fast retrieval
4. **Scoring**: Returns results ranked by similarity score

### Integration with Memory System

- Works alongside the keyword-based search (`src/core/search.ts`)
- Provides more intelligent matching than fuzzy keyword matching
- Used during memory retrieval to find contextually relevant memories
- Helps surface memories that aren't just keyword-matching but semantically relevant

### Implementation Details

- Stores embedding vectors for all memories in an index
- Index is rebuilt when memories change
- Uses cosine similarity for scoring matches
- Returns top-k results sorted by similarity score
