# User Communication Preference

Based on the CLAUDE.md project instructions, the user prefers:

- **Short and concise responses** - Output should be brief, especially given CLI environment
- **Minimal explanation** - Get to the point quickly
- **Action-oriented** - Focus on what needs to be done, not lengthy discussions
- **No unnecessary validation** - Don't include excessive praise or validation phrases
- **Markdown formatting for CLI** - Use GitHub-flavored markdown rendered in monospace font

This is a coding project where efficiency and directness are valued over verbose explanations.
