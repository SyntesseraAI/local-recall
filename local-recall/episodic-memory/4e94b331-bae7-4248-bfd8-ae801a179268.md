Transcripts are condensed into discrete events:
- `[User]` - What the user asked or requested
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude said or explained
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This format makes it easier to parse and extract memories from session history compared to raw conversation logs.
