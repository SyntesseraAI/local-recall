# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by underscores and special characters URL-encoded.

### Example

For working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`:
- Folder name: `_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (newline-delimited JSON) with timestamps:
- Each line is a separate JSON object
- Contains conversation events with timing information
- Files are automatically created and appended to by Claude Code

## Implementation in transcript-collector.ts

The `getTranscriptPath()` function in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` implements this logic:
1. Takes the working directory path
2. Replaces `/` with `_`
3. URL-encodes special characters
4. Constructs path: `~/.claude/projects/{encoded-path}/transcripts/`

This is used by the MCP server daemon to sync transcripts for memory extraction.
