The session-start hook reads recent memories from disk and outputs them to stdout. This output is injected into Claude's context at the start of a session. The hook reads up to 5 most recent memories directly from the `local-recall/` directory, sorted by `occurred_at` timestamp. Output format is plain text suitable for context injection.
