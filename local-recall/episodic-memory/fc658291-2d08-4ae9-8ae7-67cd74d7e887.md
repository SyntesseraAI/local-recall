Hooks are configured in hooks.json and execute as shell commands that receive JSON input via stdin:
- SessionStart: Triggered on session begin, loads 5 most recent memories
- UserPromptSubmit: Triggered before Claude processes user prompt, performs semantic search
- Stop: Currently disabled (memory extraction handled by MCP server daemon)

Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json` and can reference either npm package installation or local project directory paths.
