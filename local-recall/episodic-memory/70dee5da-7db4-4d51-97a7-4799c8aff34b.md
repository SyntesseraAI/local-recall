Memory extraction prompts are defined in a dedicated prompt module (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts). This allows:
- Separation of concerns between prompt logic and extraction logic
- Easy updates to extraction criteria without modifying extraction code
- Reusable prompt templates that can be versioned and tested

The prompts guide Claude in identifying what information should become memories based on the project's specific needs.
