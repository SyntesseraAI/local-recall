The local-recall project does not currently have a GitHub MCP server configured. To use GitHub features like viewing PR suggestions or comments, a GitHub MCP server would need to be installed and configured in `.claude/settings.json` under `mcpServers`. This would allow access to PR comments and other GitHub data through Claude Code.
