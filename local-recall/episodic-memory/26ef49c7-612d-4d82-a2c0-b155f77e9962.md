When extracting memories from sessions:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to this project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during the session
- Important relationships between components

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

**Scope selection:**
- `global` - Entire codebase knowledge
- `file:<path>` - File-specific information
- `area:<name>` - Component or area-specific information
