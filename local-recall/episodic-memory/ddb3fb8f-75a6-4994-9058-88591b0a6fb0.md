# User Preferences for Transcript Memory Collection

Based on the user's instructions in this session, they want to:

1. **Extract keywords from text** - The ability to extract searchable keywords from prompts and transcripts
2. **Create memories from transcripts** - Build a memory extraction system that analyzes session transcripts
3. **Asynchronous processing** - The MCP server daemon processes transcripts every 5 minutes

## Key Preference

The user explicitly asked: "Extract keywords from this text and return only the keywords as a JSON array of strings."

This suggests they want a simple, clean interface for keyword extraction that returns just the data needed without extra explanation or formatting.

## Implementation Note

When the transcript-collector is called, it should process the transcript and extract relevant keywords/memories, then return the results in a structured format (likely JSON) for the MCP server to create memory files.
