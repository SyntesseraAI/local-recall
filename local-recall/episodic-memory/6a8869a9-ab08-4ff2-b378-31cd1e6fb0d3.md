Search results are ranked by cosine similarity score (0.0 = no match, 1.0 = identical). Scores are rounded to 2 decimal places. When scores are equal, recency tie-breaking applies (more recent memories ranked first by occurred_at timestamp). This provides consistent, predictable ranking across searches.
