Claude Code fetches plugins from GitHub repositories. The MCP server startup failure was caused by `local-recall-plugin/scripts/` being in .gitignore, so the scripts weren't available when Claude Code tried to run them. Solution: remove plugin script directories from .gitignore to ensure they're git-tracked and available to Claude Code when installing plugins from GitHub.

Key learning: Any files needed for plugin execution must be committed to git - Claude Code doesn't have access to local .gitignore rules when pulling from remote repos.
