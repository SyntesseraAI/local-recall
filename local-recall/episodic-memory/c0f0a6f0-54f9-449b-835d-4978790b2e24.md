Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows Claude Code and other AI tools via MCP to retain information and context across sessions. All memories are stored locally in structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory, making them version-controllable and shareable. The system includes a vector store (SQLite + fastembed embeddings) for semantic search, Claude Code hooks for session-start and user-prompt-submit integration, and an MCP server that processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes.
