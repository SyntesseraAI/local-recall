The memory extraction process uses structured prompts to guide Claude's analysis. These prompts are stored separately in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and define:

- How to identify valuable memories from transcript content
- What constitutes a worth-while memory vs trivial information
- Output format expectations for extracted memories
- Scope classification rules (global, file-specific, area-specific)

This separation allows for easy refinement of extraction quality by updating prompts without modifying the extraction logic.
