Memory extraction uses a dedicated prompt file (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) that contains structured instructions for Claude Haiku to:

1. Extract relevant keywords from transcript content
2. Identify duplicate memories by analyzing content patterns
3. Determine appropriate scope for memories (global vs file-specific vs area-specific)

The prompts are optimized for Haiku's smaller context window and faster processing speed. This separation allows easy updating of extraction logic without modifying the core memory-extractor code.
