When multiple Claude Code instances are running, old MCP server processes may remain running even after code changes. This causes duplicate log entries in recall.log (each line appears twice) and means transcript collection uses outdated code.

**Detection**: Check recall.log for duplicate entries or mismatched log messages compared to source code.

**Resolution**: Kill old MCP server processes and restart Claude Code instances, or rebuild and redeploy the bundled server.js to the plugin cache.
