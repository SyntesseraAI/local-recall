# Memory Extraction from Transcripts

Local Recall processes Claude Code transcripts to automatically extract and store memories:

## Current Implementation

- The MCP server includes a background daemon that scans transcripts every 5 minutes
- Transcripts are loaded from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
- Content hashes are used to detect changes and avoid duplicate processing
- When a transcript changes, old memories are deleted and recreated

## Key Consideration

The transcript collector needs to identify the correct Claude project folder from the working directory. This involves:
1. Getting the absolute working directory
2. Replacing slashes with dashes to match Claude's folder naming convention
3. Constructing the full transcript path: `~/.claude/projects/<folder>/transcripts/`
