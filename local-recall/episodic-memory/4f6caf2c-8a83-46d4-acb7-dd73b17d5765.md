Error 'Tokenizer file not found at local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json' indicates corrupted or incomplete model cache (usually from interrupted download). Fix: Remove corrupted cache with `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*`. Model will re-download automatically on next run. First startup takes 30-60 seconds for initial download, subsequent runs load from cache.
