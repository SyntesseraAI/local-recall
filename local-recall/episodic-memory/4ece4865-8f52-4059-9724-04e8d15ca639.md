Current refactoring work is extracting embedding and vector store functionality from monolithic files into dedicated modules: `src/core/embedding.ts` and `src/core/vector-store.ts`. This improves code organization and separation of concerns. The refactoring is on branch `claude/refactor-memory-collection-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`.
