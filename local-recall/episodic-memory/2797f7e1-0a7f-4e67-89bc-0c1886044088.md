The memory-extractor module uses Claude Haiku model to process condensed transcripts and extract valuable memories. It sends transcripts to Claude with a structured prompt (from src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) that guides the extraction process. The extracted memories follow the standard memory format with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content fields.
