The thinking extractor (lines 41-46) captures **every** thinking block from assistant messages without applying any content-based filtering. It simply extracts all `type: 'thinking'` blocks and joins them.

**Current behavior**: All thinking is stored as-is, which may include low-value reasoning or repetitive thoughts.

**Consideration for future**: If filtering is needed in the future, it would need to be added to the extraction logic, not at search time.
