Error 'Tokenizer file not found at local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json' indicates corrupted/incomplete embedding model cache (usually from interrupted download). Fix by removing corrupted cache: rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*. Model will re-download automatically on next run.
