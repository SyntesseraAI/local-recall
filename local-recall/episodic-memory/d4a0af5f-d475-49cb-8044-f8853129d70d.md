Memory extraction prompts are centralized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This module contains the structured prompts used to instruct Claude on how to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. The prompts guide the extraction process based on the guidelines defined in the CLAUDE.md file regarding what should and shouldn't be extracted.
