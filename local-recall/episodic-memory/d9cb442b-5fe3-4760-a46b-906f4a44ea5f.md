The user runs multiple Claude instances simultaneously and cannot use a centralized daemon approach because it would prevent concurrent Claude sessions. This is a hard constraint that rules out embedding daemon strategies that require process isolation or exclusive port binding. Solutions must support true concurrent usage across multiple Claude instances.
