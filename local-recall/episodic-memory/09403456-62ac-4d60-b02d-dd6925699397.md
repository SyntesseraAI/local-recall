TypeScript source in src/ is compiled to dist/. For plugin distribution, scripts are bundled using a build tool (likely esbuild based on common practices) into scripts/ directory, which is gitignored. The scripts/ contains: scripts/hooks/ (session-start.js, user-prompt-submit.js, stop.js) and scripts/mcp-server/server.js. These are the executables referenced by hooks.json and .mcp.json for the Claude Code plugin system.
