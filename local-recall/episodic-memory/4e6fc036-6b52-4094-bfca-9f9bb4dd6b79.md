The memory-extractor.ts module uses the Anthropic Claude API (claude-opus-4-1 model) to extract memories from transcripts. It sends transcript content with a system prompt to guide Claude in identifying and structuring valuable memories. The extraction returns memories with metadata including subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content. The system uses a dedicated prompt file (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) that defines the extraction rules and format.
