# Transcript Condensing Process

The transcript collector condenses transcripts into key events before memory extraction.

## Purpose

Condensing:
- Removes redundant or verbose content that clutters memories
- Extracts only the significant events that are worth remembering
- Reduces token usage when processing with Claude Haiku
- Makes memories more focused and actionable

## Format

Condensed transcripts use a simplified event format:
- `[User]` - What the user asked or requested
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude said or explained
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

## Processing

The condensing happens in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` before memories are extracted. This condensed format is more efficient for Claude Haiku to process when generating memories.
