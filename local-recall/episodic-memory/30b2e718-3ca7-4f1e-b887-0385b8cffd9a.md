Each memory is stored as a markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing metadata fields: id (UUID), subject, keywords, applies_to (scope), occurred_at (ISO-8601), and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix). Memory files are version-controlled in git and located in local-recall/episodic-memory/. The format enables atomic storage of individual concepts and supports semantic searchability.
