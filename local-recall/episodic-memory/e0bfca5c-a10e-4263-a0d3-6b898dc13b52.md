Local Recall uses the fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The model is approximately 133MB and automatically downloads to `local_cache/` on first use.

**First run behavior:** Initial startup takes 30-60 seconds while the model downloads. Subsequent runs load from cache.

**Troubleshooting:** If you see tokenizer file not found errors, the cache may be corrupted. Remove `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and the model will re-download on next run.
