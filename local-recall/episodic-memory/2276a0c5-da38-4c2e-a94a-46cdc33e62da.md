The session-start hook initialization flow now guarantees `.gitignore` creation:

1. Hook calls `searchEngine.getRelevantForSession()`
2. Which calls `indexManager.getIndex()`
3. Which calls `ensureGitignore()` before returning
4. If local-recall folder doesn't exist, it's created
5. If `.gitignore` doesn't exist, it's created

This ensures that even on the very first session, the `.gitignore` file is properly set up to exclude `orama-*.json` index files and `recall.log`. This happens transparently as part of normal session startup.
