Local Recall employs Claude Haiku with streaming for transcript processing tasks to balance speed and quality. Streaming allows for responsive processing without waiting for complete responses, and Haiku's smaller model size ensures efficiency. This pattern should be used when processing large amounts of text or when latency is a concern.
