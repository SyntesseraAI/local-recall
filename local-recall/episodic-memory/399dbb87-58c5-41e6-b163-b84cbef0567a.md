# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

When extracting memories from Claude Code transcripts, the raw `.jsonl` format is inefficient for analysis. The solution is to condense transcripts into a simpler event format:

## Condensing Strategy

Raw `.jsonl` transcripts contain:
- Full conversation messages with complete details
- Repeated context and system prompts
- Verbose tool invocation metadata

Condensed format should include:
- `[User]` events - what the user asked
- `[Assistant]` events - what Claude said or decided
- `[Tool: Name]` events - tool invocations (action taken)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` events - outcome of actions

## Implementation

The transcript collector should:
1. Parse `.jsonl` files from Claude's transcript cache
2. Extract core events (user input, assistant reasoning, tool use, results)
3. Summarize or condense verbose parts
4. Create a condensed transcript format
5. Use the condensed format for memory extraction analysis

This reduces token usage while preserving the essential information needed to extract meaningful memories.
