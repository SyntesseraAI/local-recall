# Transcript Condensing Feature

The user is working on condensing Claude transcripts into a more compact format for memory extraction.

## Purpose

Full transcripts are verbose and contain too much detail. Condensing them reduces noise and focuses on:
- What the user asked
- What Claude explained or discovered
- What tools were used
- What the results were

## Format Being Developed

Condensed format uses event markers:
- `[User]` - User requests/questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's explanations/responses
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool outcomes

This condensed format is then fed to Claude (via `claude -p`) to extract meaningful memories.
