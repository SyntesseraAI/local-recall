Memories use an `applies_to` field to define their scope: `global` (entire codebase), `file:<path>` (specific file), or `area:<name>` (component/feature area). Hooks use the current file path and context to filter which memories are relevant. This allows the same codebase to have multiple memories that apply only to specific parts, reducing noise in context injection.
