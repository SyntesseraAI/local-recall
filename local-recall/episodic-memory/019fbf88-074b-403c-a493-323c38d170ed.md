Currently NO memory compaction/cleanup exists. The config has a `maxMemories` option (default 1000) but it's not actively enforced. Memories are only deduplicated at creation time using content hash + timestamp. There is no periodic pruning, merging, or consolidation of memories, which could become an issue as memory store grows over time.
