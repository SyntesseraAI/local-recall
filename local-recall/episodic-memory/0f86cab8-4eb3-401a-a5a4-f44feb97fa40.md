Good memories are specific (include file paths, function names, concrete details), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes). Avoid extracting generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, sensitive data, or information that becomes outdated quickly. Focus on architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns specific to the project, configuration quirks, user preferences, and important component relationships.
