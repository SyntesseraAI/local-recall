If `local-recall/recall.log` shows duplicate log entries, it indicates multiple MCP server instances are running for the same project and both writing to the log file. This typically happens when code is rebuilt but old server processes aren't killed. Check timestamps of source files vs dist files to identify if running against stale compiled code.
