## Situation

Repository had hundreds of deleted episodic memory files showing in git status, blocking normal operations.

## Solution

The episodic memory files were already deleted from the working directory but not committed. This is expected behavior as the repository maintains version-controlled memory markdown files.

## Key Insight

Memory files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` and `local-recall/thinking-memory/` are git-tracked markdown files that store memories for future AI assistant sessions. When memories are deleted or regenerated, git shows these changes. These are legitimate repository changes and should be committed as part of normal operation.

## Status

The git status output shows `D` (deleted) markers for episodic memory files - this is normal housekeeping. The index files (`orama-episodic-index.json` and `orama-thinking-index.json`) are gitignored and auto-generated, so they don't appear in git status.
