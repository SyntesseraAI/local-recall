The local-recall plugin maintains version information in multiple locations that must be kept in sync:
- `package.json` - npm package version
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Claude plugin manifest
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` - Marketplace deployment file

When updating the version, all three files must be updated and the marketplace.json must be explicitly deployed/published to reflect changes.
