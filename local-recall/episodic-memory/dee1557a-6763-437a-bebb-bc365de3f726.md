# Current Session Focus

The user is working on the Local Recall project with focus on:
1. Understanding how memories are extracted from Claude transcripts
2. Analyzing the transcript processing pipeline
3. Learning about the MCP server's memory extraction daemon
4. Exploring the relationship between transcript location and memory creation

This session appears to be exploratory/learning-focused rather than implementing specific features.
