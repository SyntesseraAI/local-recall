Both `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` and `src/core/index.ts` create gitignore files with identical functionality. This duplication should be refactored into a shared utility function to avoid maintaining the same logic in two places. The gitignore management functionality could be extracted to a dedicated utility module (e.g., `src/utils/gitignore.ts`) and imported by both files.
