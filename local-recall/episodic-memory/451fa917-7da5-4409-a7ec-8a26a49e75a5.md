# MCP Server Background Daemon

The MCP server runs a background daemon that automatically processes Claude Code transcripts to extract and create memories.

## How It Works

1. Daemon runs every 5 minutes
2. Syncs transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
3. Processes transcripts using Claude to extract memories
4. Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
5. When transcripts change, deletes old memories and creates new ones

## Why This Matters

- Memories are created asynchronously, not during Stop hook (which is disabled)
- The system deduplicates memories based on content hashes
- Provides automatic memory management without manual intervention
- Allows the transcript processing to be resource-intensive without blocking the Claude Code session
