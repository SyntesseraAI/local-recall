The vector store implements semantic search with:
- Score range: 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (identical)
- Scores rounded to 2 decimal places (e.g., 0.65)
- Results sorted by score descending
- Recency tie-breaker: When scores are equal, more recent memories (earlier occurred_at) rank first
- Uses better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity calculations
