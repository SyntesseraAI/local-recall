The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku with carefully crafted prompts to analyze session transcripts and identify valuable memories. The extraction process is defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts and handles condensed transcript events. This approach allows the system to intelligently filter relevant information while avoiding generic knowledge and trivial details.
