Claude stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` with URL-encoded directory names. The naming convention uses the full path with hyphens replacing slashes. Example: `/Users/joe/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/` contains transcript files in JSONL format. This is important for the MCP daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes to extract memories.
