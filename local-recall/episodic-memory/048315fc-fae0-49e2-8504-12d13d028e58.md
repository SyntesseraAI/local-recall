The memory extractor module (src/core/memory-extractor.ts) handles the core logic of processing transcripts and extracting memories using the Claude CLI. It invokes the `claude` command with a specialized prompt to parse transcript content and generate memory objects with metadata (subject, keywords, scope, content).
