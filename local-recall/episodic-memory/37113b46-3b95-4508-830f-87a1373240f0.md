# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Slashes are replaced with dashes
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/{folder}/transcripts/`

## Implementation Details

The `transcript-collector.ts` module needs to:
1. Convert the current working directory to the Claude projects folder format
2. Replace all forward slashes with dashes
3. Look for JSONL transcript files in that directory

This path conversion is critical for the MCP server to locate and process transcripts correctly.
