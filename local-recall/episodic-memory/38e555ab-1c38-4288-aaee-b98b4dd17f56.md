# Transcript Collector Refactoring

The `transcript-collector.ts` file was refactored to:
- Standardize string quotes (double quotes)
- Improve logging consistency throughout the module
- Enhance debugging output for transcript collection operations

This refactoring improves code maintainability and makes debugging easier when working with transcript collection.
