SessionStart hook is triggered when Claude Code session begins. It:
1. Receives JSON with session_id, transcript_path, cwd
2. Loads memory index from local-recall/index.json
3. Retrieves relevant memories based on current context
4. Outputs memory content to stdout (injected into Claude's system context)

This enriches Claude's knowledge about the project and ongoing patterns discovered in previous sessions.
