# Version Control Preferences

During development, the user expressed preference to keep logs and auto-generated index files out of git:

## Currently Gitignored

- `local-recall/index.json` - Auto-generated keyword index (rebuilt on-demand)
- `local-recall/recall.log` - Debug log file (generated during runtime)
- `node_modules/` - Standard npm dependencies
- `.DS_Store` - macOS system files

## Rationale

- Memory files (`.md`) ARE version-controlled as they represent persistent knowledge
- Generated files that can be recreated should not be committed
- Logs are temporary debugging artifacts

## Configuration

The `.gitignore` file in `local-recall/` directory controls these settings.
