Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows Claude Code and other AI tools via MCP to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files stored in local-recall/episodic-memory/. The system includes:

- Memory manager for CRUD operations
- Vector store with SQLite + BGE embeddings for semantic search
- Claude Code hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop)
- MCP server exposing memory tools
- Background daemon processing transcripts every 5 minutes

All memories are version-controlled markdown files with YAML frontmatter containing id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, and content_hash fields.
