# Memory Extraction from Session Transcripts

Memory extraction is the process of analyzing Claude Code session transcripts to identify valuable learnings:

## Key Principles

1. **Extract specific knowledge** - File paths, function names, concrete details matter
2. **Be concise** - One concept per memory
3. **Be actionable** - Help future assistants work more efficiently
4. **Scope appropriately**:
   - `global` - Codebase-wide patterns and conventions
   - `file:<path>` - File-specific knowledge
   - `area:<name>` - Component or feature area knowledge

## What to Extract

- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences
- Component relationships
- Performance considerations

## What NOT to Extract

- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly
