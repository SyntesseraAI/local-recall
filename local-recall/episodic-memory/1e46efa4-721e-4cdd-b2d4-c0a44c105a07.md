The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku API to analyze transcripts and extract meaningful memories. The extraction is driven by structured prompts defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts. The system sends transcript content to Claude and parses the response to create memory objects with proper metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash).
