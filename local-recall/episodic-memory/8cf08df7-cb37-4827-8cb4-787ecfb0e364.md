The vector store (src/core/vector-store.ts) uses better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for semantic search. Embeddings are generated using fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB, cached in local_cache/). Search results use cosine distance scoring (0.0-1.0), rounded to 2 decimal places, with recency as tie-breaker.
