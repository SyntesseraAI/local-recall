Local Recall has successfully implemented the core infrastructure:

- **Memory Management**: Complete CRUD operations in `src/core/memory.ts`
- **Indexing**: Index management system in `src/core/index.ts` using Fuse.js for fuzzy search
- **Hooks**: Two Claude Code hooks are complete:
  - `session-start` hook loads relevant memories at session start
  - `stop` hook auto-extracts memories from transcripts
- **MCP Server**: Fully implemented with 6 exposed tools
- **Keyword Extraction**: Working system for extracting searchable keywords
- **Search**: Complete fuzzy search implementation in `src/core/search.ts`

The foundation is stable and ready for enhancement. Next priorities are higher-level features like CLI, deduplication, memory decay, or smart retrieval.
