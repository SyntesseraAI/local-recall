Memory extraction prompts include specific tone and style guidance:
- Use concise, actionable language
- Avoid generic programming knowledge
- Focus on project-specific patterns and decisions
- Include file paths and function names for specificity
- Extract architectural decisions with reasoning
- Identify bug fixes and root causes
- Capture user preferences and conventions

The prompt system ensures extracted memories are valuable for future assistants working on the codebase.
