## Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The transcript condensing process:

1. **Takes full transcripts** from JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/*/transcripts/`
2. **Reduces context** by summarizing verbose assistant responses
3. **Produces condensed format** showing key events:
   - `[User]` blocks for user prompts/messages
   - `[Assistant]` blocks for Claude's responses (summarized)
   - `[Tool: Name]` blocks for tool invocations
   - `[Result: OK/ERROR]` blocks for tool outcomes
4. **Benefits**:
   - More manageable context size for memory extraction
   - Still preserves all essential information about what happened
   - Easier for Claude to identify important memories

This condensed format is the bridge between raw transcripts and extracted memories.
