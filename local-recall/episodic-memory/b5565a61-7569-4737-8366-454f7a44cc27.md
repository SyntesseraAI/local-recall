When extracting memories from session transcripts, prioritize semantic importance and actionable insights over transcript volume. The project uses transcript condensing to focus on meaningful events rather than verbose logs. This helps create higher-quality, more relevant memories that future assistants will find genuinely useful rather than drowning in verbose session details.
