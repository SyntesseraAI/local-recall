The extraction prompt used for Claude Haiku is stored in a separate file `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` rather than embedded in the extractor code. This design choice enables:

1. Easy maintenance and iteration on the prompt without modifying the extractor logic
2. Version control of prompt changes separately from code changes
3. Ability to swap or test different prompts without code changes
4. Clear separation of concerns between extraction logic and prompt content

This follows the principle of externalizing configuration and business logic from core code.
