# Transcript Event Structure for Memory Extraction

Transcripts contain structured events that should be parsed to identify valuable memories:

- `[User]` - User questions, requests, or inputs
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's explanations, analysis, or decisions
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Success or failure status of tool invocations

## Memory Extraction Strategy

1. Identify what was learned or discovered
2. Extract architectural decisions and their reasoning
3. Note bug fixes and root cause analysis
4. Capture code patterns specific to the project
5. Record configuration quirks or important findings
6. Note relationships between components

Memories should be actionable and specific, including file paths and function names where relevant. Avoid extracting generic programming knowledge or temporary debugging steps.
