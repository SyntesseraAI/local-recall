Hooks are configured in hooks.json and execute as shell commands receiving JSON via stdin. SessionStart hook loads recent 5 memories on session begin (full reload, no vector store to avoid slow init). UserPromptSubmit hook performs semantic search on user prompts and injects matching memories. Stop hook is disabled; memory extraction happens via MCP daemon every 5 minutes instead.
