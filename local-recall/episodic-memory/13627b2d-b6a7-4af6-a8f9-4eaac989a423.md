# Transcript Collector Timestamp Handling

The `transcript-collector.ts` module processes JSONL transcript files where each event has a timestamp property. When analyzing transcripts for memory extraction:

1. Events contain `timestamp` fields in ISO-8601 format
2. Need to parse and filter events that occurred within a specific session
3. The transcript file may contain events from multiple sessions
4. Filtering logic should use occurred_at timestamps to determine which events are relevant

This is used by the memory extraction process to determine which conversation events should become memories.
