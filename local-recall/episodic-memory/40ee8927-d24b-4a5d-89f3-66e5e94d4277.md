The memory extraction process uses `claude -p` (Claude prompt mode) to analyze condensed transcripts. The extraction prompt is defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and structures the extraction task with specific guidelines about what to extract and what not to extract. The process converts raw transcripts into structured memories with appropriate scope (global, file:, or area:).
