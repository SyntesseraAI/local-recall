Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) files, one file per session.

## Key Implementation Details

When extracting memories from transcripts:
1. The transcript collector needs to handle this path construction
2. Transcripts are sequential JSON objects, not a single JSON array
3. Each line represents an event in the conversation (user message, assistant message, tool invocation)
4. File paths in the working directory (`cwd`) are absolute paths that need careful parsing

## Relevance to Local Recall

This is critical for the MCP server's background daemon which syncs transcripts every 5 minutes to extract memories.
