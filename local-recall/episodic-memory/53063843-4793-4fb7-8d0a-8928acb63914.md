The `local-recall/index.json` file contains a mapping of keywords to memory IDs for fast searching. The index structure is: `{ keywords: { 'keyword': ['memory-id-1', 'memory-id-2'] } }`. This allows fast fuzzy search lookups without scanning every memory file. The index is rebuilt when memories are created or deleted.
