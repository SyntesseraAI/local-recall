# Transcript Event Structure

Claude Code transcripts are JSONL files containing events with a `type` field that indicates the kind of event.

## Event Types Observed

- `user` - User input events
- `assistant` - Assistant responses
- `tool_call` - When Claude invokes a tool
- `tool_result` - Result from tool execution

## Event Structure

Each event is a complete JSON object on a single line. Events contain:
- `type` - The event type
- `timestamp` - When the event occurred
- `content` or related fields depending on type
- Metadata about the session

## Important for Memory Extraction

The transcript collector in Local Recall needs to parse these JSONL event streams to:
1. Extract meaningful memories from the conversation flow
2. Track which transcripts have been processed via content hashing
3. Regenerate memories when transcript content changes
