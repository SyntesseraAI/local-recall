The project has migrated from using SQLite with the sqlite-vec extension to Orama, a pure JavaScript vector search library. This change allows:

1. **Bundling**: Hooks can be bundled without native dependencies
2. **Distribution**: Plugin hooks work without requiring native module compilation
3. **Simplicity**: No need for the HTTP daemon architecture that was used to avoid mutex lock errors from concurrent sqlite-vec access

Orama handles both episodic and thinking memory searches through the same interface. Old code referencing sqlite-vec, http-server.ts, or daemon-client.ts is stale and should be removed.
