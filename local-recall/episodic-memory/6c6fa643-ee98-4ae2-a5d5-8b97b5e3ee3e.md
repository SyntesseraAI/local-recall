The memory extraction process includes transcript condensing to improve efficiency with Claude Haiku. Instead of sending full transcript details to the model, the system summarizes:

- User requests as `[User]` entries
- Claude responses as `[Assistant]` entries  
- Tool invocations as `[Tool: Name]` entries
- Tool outcomes as `[Result: OK/ERROR]` entries

This condensed format significantly reduces token usage while preserving the essential information needed for memory extraction. This is important because the MCP server processes transcripts frequently (every 5 minutes in the background daemon), so token efficiency directly impacts operational costs.
