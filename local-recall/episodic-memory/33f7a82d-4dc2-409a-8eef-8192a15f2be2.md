# Keyword Extraction for Memory System

When extracting keywords from text for the local-recall memory system:
- Return ONLY a JSON array of strings
- No explanation or additional text
- Keywords should be lowercase and specific
- Focus on searchable terms that will help future sessions find this memory
- Keep keywords concise (1-3 words per keyword)

This is used by the memory extraction process to make memories discoverable through the search system.
