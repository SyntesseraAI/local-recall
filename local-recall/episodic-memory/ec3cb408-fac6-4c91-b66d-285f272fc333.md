Local Recall is a plugin/MCP server that stores structured memories as markdown files with YAML frontmatter. It enables Claude and other AI assistants to retain contextual information across sessions, with memories stored locally in version-controlled markdown files in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. The system uses fuzzy search, keyword indexing, and Claude API integration for memory extraction and retrieval.
