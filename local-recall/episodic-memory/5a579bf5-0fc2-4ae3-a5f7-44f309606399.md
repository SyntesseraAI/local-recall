The Stop hook is not triggered in the VS Code extension, which prevents automatic memory creation. The Stop hook (src/hooks/stop.ts:77-108) is responsible for parsing transcripts and creating memories, but it never fires in VS Code environments. This is likely because the VS Code extension has different hook support than the web-based Claude Code editor.

This means memories are not automatically created from sessions in VS Code unless using alternative approaches like:
1. Using MCP tools directly (episodic_create, thinking_create)
2. Using the background daemon for async processing
3. Manual memory creation via MCP interface
