# Transcript Condenser Event Collection

The transcript condenser in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` collects JSONL transcript events into an array structure before processing them.

## Current Implementation

The `condenseTranscript` function:
1. Reads JSONL transcript file line by line
2. Parses each JSON event
3. Collects all events into an `events` array
4. Processes the complete array as a batch

## Event Format

Each transcript event contains metadata about:
- Event type (user input, assistant response, tool invocation, result)
- Content/payload
- Timestamp or sequence information
- Tool-specific data when applicable

## Processing

After collecting all events into the array, the condenser can:
- Filter events by type
- Group related events (e.g., tool calls with their results)
- Extract meaningful memory content from the sequence
- Generate summaries or extract key decisions/learnings
