Local Recall uses BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) downloaded via fastembed. First run takes 30-60 seconds as model downloads to `local_cache/`. Subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file is corrupted, error occurs - fix by removing `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` directory and re-running.
