# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder name: `_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local_recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local_recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files within this directory, with filenames following the pattern: `<session-id>.jsonl`

Each line in a JSONL file is a complete JSON object representing a single transcript event.

## Relevance to Local Recall

The `transcript-collector` in local-recall needs to read from this location to access Claude Code's session transcripts for memory extraction.
