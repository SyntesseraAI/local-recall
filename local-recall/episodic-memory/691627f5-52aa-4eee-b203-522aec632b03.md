The thinking memory extractor processes transcripts using 20 parallel workers to extract thinking blocks and their corresponding outputs efficiently.

**Implementation detail**: `src/core/thinking-extractor.ts` uses Promise.all() with a concurrency limit of 20 to process large transcripts in parallel.

**Why parallelism**: Thinking memory extraction is I/O-bound (reading transcripts, generating embeddings) and can be parallelized safely since each extraction is independent.

**Configuration**: The 20-worker limit is hardcoded but could be made configurable based on system resources.
