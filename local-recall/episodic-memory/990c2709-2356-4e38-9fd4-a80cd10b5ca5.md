Session transcripts are condensed into a standardized format with clear event markers:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses or explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations with their parameters
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool calls

This normalization allows the memory extraction system to consistently parse and analyze transcripts regardless of their original format, enabling reliable automated memory creation.
