The extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` includes detailed guidelines about:
- What to extract: architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, performance optimizations
- What NOT to extract: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, sensitive data, outdated information

This prevents storing trivial or ephemeral information and focuses memories on actionable, project-specific knowledge.
