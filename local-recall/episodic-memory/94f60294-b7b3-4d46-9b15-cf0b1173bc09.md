The MCP server includes a background daemon that syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, processes them using claude -p to extract memories, and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection. The daemon runs every 5 minutes, deleting and recreating memories when transcripts change. This replaces the disabled Stop hook for asynchronous memory extraction.
