# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes. Transcripts are stored as JSONL files that contain session records with messages, tool invocations, and results.
