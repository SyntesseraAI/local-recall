The file `thinking.jsonl` (2.8MB, 2121 lines) is a leftover from the first storage migration (Markdown → single JSONL). This predates the current multi-file format migration.

File status:
- `thinking.jsonl` - OLD single-file format (should be deleted)
- `thinking-000001.jsonl` - NEW multi-file format (155 lines, 191KB)

The old file should be removed as it's redundant with the new multi-file approach.
