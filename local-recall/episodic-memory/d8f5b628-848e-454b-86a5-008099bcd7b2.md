Extraction prompts and system instructions are maintained in a separate file `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This separation of concerns keeps the extraction logic clean and makes it easier to iterate on prompts without modifying the core extraction engine. The prompts define the rules and format for what constitutes a valuable memory.
