The MCP server background daemon condenses transcripts before using Claude Haiku to extract memories. This reduces token consumption and makes the memory extraction process more efficient. Condensed transcripts focus on events (User requests, Assistant responses, Tool invocations) rather than raw transcript data, making them suitable for memory extraction without losing important context.
