Transcripts are condensed into a structured format with clear markers:
- `[User]` - User requests or queries
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This condensed format is then passed to Claude for memory extraction analysis, making it easier to identify significant events and learnings from the session.
