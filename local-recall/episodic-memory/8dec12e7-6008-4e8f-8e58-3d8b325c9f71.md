The memory extraction system processes session transcripts to identify and create valuable memories. The transcript includes:

- Condensed format with events: [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], [Result]
- Contains everything the user asked, what Claude explained, and tools used
- Is passed as input to the MemoryExtractor for analysis
- The extraction analyzes this transcript to find patterns, decisions, and learnings
- Used by the stop hook and MCP daemon to automatically create memories from coding sessions
