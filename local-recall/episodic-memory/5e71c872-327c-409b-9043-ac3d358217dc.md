# Transcript Format Structure

Claude Code transcript files use JSON Lines (.jsonl) format, where each line is a valid JSON object representing a transcript event.

## Event Structure

Each line in a `.jsonl` file contains an event object with:
- `id`: Sequential event ID (number, starting from 0)
- `type`: Event type (e.g., 'user_message', 'assistant_response', etc.)
- `content`: The event content (varies by type)
- `timestamp`: ISO-8601 timestamp
- Other type-specific fields

## Parsing Considerations

- Read `.jsonl` files line-by-line, parsing each line as separate JSON
- Do NOT try to parse the entire file as a single JSON object
- Use event IDs to maintain event order
- Events are appended sequentially as the session progresses
