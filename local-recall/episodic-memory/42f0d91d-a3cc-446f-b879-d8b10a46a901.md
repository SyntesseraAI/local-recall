The memory extractor in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model via streaming to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. It processes the transcript text through a prompt system (defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) that instructs Claude to identify and create memories according to the project's memory extraction guidelines.

Key implementation details:
- Uses streaming API for efficient token processing
- Integrates with the memory creation system to persist extracted memories
- Processes condensed transcripts that contain user requests, assistant responses, and tool invocations
- Follows specific guidelines for what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, config quirks) and what NOT to extract (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data)
