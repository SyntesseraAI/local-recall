The memory extraction system is automatically triggered when a user prompt contains the `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` marker. This marker signals that Claude should analyze the current session transcript and extract valuable memories. The extraction logic is handled by the memory-extractor module which processes the transcript to identify learnings, architectural insights, bug fixes, and codebase-specific patterns.
