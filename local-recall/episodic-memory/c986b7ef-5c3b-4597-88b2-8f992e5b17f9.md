When extracting memories from transcripts, condense repeated information to improve quality and reduce token usage. This is especially important for:

- Tool invocations with identical inputs repeated multiple times
- Duplicate user queries or similar requests
- Repetitive assistant responses

Condensing reduces noise and focuses extraction on meaningful changes and learning moments. Implement this before passing transcript content to the extraction model.
