The memory extraction system uses carefully crafted prompts that guide Claude to generate memories in YAML frontmatter format with markdown content. The prompt specifies required fields (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash) and provides clear guidelines for what constitutes extractable vs non-extractable information. This structured approach ensures consistency and reliability when parsing extracted memories.
