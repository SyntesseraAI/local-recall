The memory extraction system processes condensed transcripts with a specific format:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses or explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This condensed format is used in `/src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to structure how transcripts are presented to the memory extraction system. The system analyzes these condensed events to identify valuable learnings and architectural insights.
