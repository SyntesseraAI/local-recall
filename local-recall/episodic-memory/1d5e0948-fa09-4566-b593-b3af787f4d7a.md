The transcript collector had DEBUG-level logging which is not visible by default (log level defaults to 'error'). When users encounter issues with transcripts not being found in new repos, they need higher-level (INFO) logging to diagnose the problem without manually changing log levels.

Convention: Use INFO-level logging for user-facing diagnostic messages that help troubleshoot setup issues, reserve DEBUG for detailed technical tracing used during development.
