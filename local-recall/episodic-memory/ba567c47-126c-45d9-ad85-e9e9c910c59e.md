The vector store implementation in src/core/vector-store.ts uses:
- better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search
- fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB)
- Cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0, rounded to 2 decimal places)
- Embedding model automatically downloaded to local_cache/ on first use
- Results sorted by similarity score descending, with recency (occurred_at) as tie-breaker

First run takes 30-60 seconds for model download; subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file corruption occurs, remove local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5* to trigger re-download.
