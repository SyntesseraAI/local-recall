The memory extraction prompt defines clear guidelines for what to extract:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions
- Configuration quirks
- User preferences
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Outdated information

**Scope guidance:**
- `global` - entire codebase
- `file:<path>` - specific file
- `area:<name>` - component/area
