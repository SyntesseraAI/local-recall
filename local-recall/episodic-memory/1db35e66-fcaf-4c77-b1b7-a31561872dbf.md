# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with specific transformations:
1. The absolute path is hashed (MD5 or similar)
2. The hash is Base32-encoded
3. The encoded value becomes the folder name

Example: For working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`, Claude creates a corresponding project folder at `~/.claude/projects/<hash>/`

## Transcript Storage

Transcripts are stored in JSONL format in `transcripts/` subdirectory within the project folder. Each line is a valid JSON object representing a session transcript event.

## Implementation Details

The `transcript-collector.ts` needs to:
1. Compute the project folder hash from the working directory path
2. Locate the transcripts directory at `~/.claude/projects/<hash>/transcripts/`
3. Read and parse JSONL files to extract transcript data
4. Handle MD5/Base32 encoding if needed for path resolution
