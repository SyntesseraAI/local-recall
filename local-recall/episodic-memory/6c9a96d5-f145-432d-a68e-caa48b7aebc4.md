After fixing the message grouping and mutex issues, thinking memory extraction now successfully processes transcripts and creates properly formatted thinking memories. Each memory contains both `## Thought` and `## Output` sections with correct YAML frontmatter including id, subject, applies_to, and occurred_at fields. Successfully extracted 616 thinking memories from 59 transcripts in a test run.
