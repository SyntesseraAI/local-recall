Claude stores projects in ~/.claude/projects/ using a path-to-dashes naming convention. For example, /Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall becomes -Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall. The code must convert the current working directory path by replacing forward slashes with dashes and prepending a dash, then search ~/.claude/projects/ for matching folders. Transcripts are stored directly in the project folder (not in a transcripts subfolder).
