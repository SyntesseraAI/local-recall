The memory extraction process in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku (via the `claude -p` CLI command) to analyze transcripts and extract memories. This choice was made for cost efficiency - Haiku is much cheaper than other Claude models while still being capable enough for the memory extraction task.
