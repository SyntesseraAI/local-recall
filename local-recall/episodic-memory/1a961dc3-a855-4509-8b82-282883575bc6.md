Fixed critical bug in transcript parsing where thinking content was being dropped. The issue was that `stop.ts` checked `c.text` for thinking blocks, but thinking blocks have a `c.thinking` property instead. The parser needs to check both: `c.text || c.thinking` to capture all message content. This was causing memories to be created without their actual content.
