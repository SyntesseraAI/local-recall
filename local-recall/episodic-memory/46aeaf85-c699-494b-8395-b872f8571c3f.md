The memory extraction process follows strict guidelines:

**DO Extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions
- Configuration quirks
- User preferences
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT Extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Quickly outdated information

This ensures memories remain valuable and actionable for future assistants.
