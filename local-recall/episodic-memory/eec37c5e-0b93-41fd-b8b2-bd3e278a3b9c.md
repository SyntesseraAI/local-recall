# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Naming Convention

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path of the project using a specific convention:
- The path `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes the folder `users-joe-code-syntessera-local-recall`
- All path separators are replaced with hyphens
- The entire path is lowercased
- This naming is implemented in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`

## Transcript File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line) at:
`~/.claude/projects/<path-derived-name>/transcripts/`

Each line contains a transcript event object with properties like `type`, `content`, etc.

## Why This Matters

Understanding this path convention is crucial when:
- Implementing transcript collection logic
- Testing transcript sync functionality
- Debugging transcript-related issues
- Building path-to-folder converters
