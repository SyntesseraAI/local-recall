The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku model to analyze transcript content and generate semantic keywords. The extraction process:

1. Uses a custom prompt located in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide keyword generation
2. Calls Claude Haiku API with transcript content to extract meaningful keywords
3. Keywords are generated semantically rather than through simple pattern matching
4. This enables better searchability and relevance of memories

The Haiku model is chosen for efficiency while maintaining semantic understanding of the content.
