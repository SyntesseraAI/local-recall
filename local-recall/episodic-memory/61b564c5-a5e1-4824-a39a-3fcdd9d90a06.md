The user asked whether transcript processing needs the same refactoring as the MCP server memory extraction, specifically regarding code duplication in spawning Claude. This suggests there may be parallel implementations of Claude spawning logic in different parts of the codebase (likely in transcript-collector.ts and mcp-server related code) that could be consolidated into a shared utility function.
