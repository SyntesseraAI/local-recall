Claude Code stores transcript files in `~/.claude/projects/` with subdirectories that use path-encoded project paths. The directory name format appears to be the full filesystem path encoded (hyphens replacing spaces, underscores replacing slashes). Transcript files are in JSONL format and located at `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/transcripts/`. This is used by local-recall's transcript-collector to find and process transcripts.
