The MCP server runs a background daemon that periodically (every 5 minutes) syncs transcripts from Claude's cache directory (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`), processes them using Claude Haiku to extract memories, and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection. Memories are deleted and recreated when transcripts change.
