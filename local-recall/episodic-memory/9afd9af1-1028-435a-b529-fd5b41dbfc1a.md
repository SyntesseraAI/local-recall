Local Recall uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use.

**First run performance**: Initial startup may take 30-60 seconds while the model downloads. Subsequent runs load from cache.

**Troubleshooting**: If tokenizer file not found error occurs, remove `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` directory - the model will re-download automatically.
