# Path Hashing Algorithm Needed

The transcript collector needs to implement a function that converts absolute file paths to the hash-based folder names Claude uses.

## Current Challenge

Claud uses a consistent hash-based naming scheme for project folders at `~/.claude/projects/`, but the exact algorithm needs to be determined through:
1. Inspecting existing Claude project folders on the system
2. Analyzing how Claude converts paths like `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` to folder names
3. Implementing the same algorithm in TypeScript

## Implementation Notes

- The algorithm should be deterministic and consistent
- Multiple different absolute paths should map to different folder names
- Same path should always produce the same folder name
- Likely uses a standard hashing function (SHA-256, MD5, or similar)

## Use Case

Once implemented, this will allow the transcript collector to:
- Find the correct transcript directory for the current project
- Locate and read JSONL transcript files
- Process them for memory extraction in the background daemon
