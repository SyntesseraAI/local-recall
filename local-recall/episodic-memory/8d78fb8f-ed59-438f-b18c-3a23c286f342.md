Source TypeScript files in `src/` are compiled to `dist/` (likely via npm run build). Scripts are then bundled to `scripts/` directory for production use. The bundled scripts in `scripts/hooks/` and `scripts/mcp-server/` are the actual executables used by hooks.json and .mcp.json, not the source TypeScript files. The `scripts/` directory is gitignored (build output).
