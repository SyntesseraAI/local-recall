# Embedding Model for Semantic Search

Local Recall implements semantic search using the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model through the `fastembed` library.

## Model Details

- Model: BGE-small-en-v1.5
- Library: fastembed
- Cache location: `local_cache/`
- Download size: ~133MB
- Initial download: 30-60 seconds
- Subsequent runs: Load from cache

## Architecture

The system includes two new core modules:
- `src/core/embedding.ts` - Handles embedding generation and caching
- `src/core/vector-store.ts` - Manages vector storage and similarity search

## Use Cases

Semantic search complements the existing keyword-based search, allowing:
- Fuzzy conceptual matching beyond exact keywords
- Finding memories by meaning, not just literal terms
- Better recall of related memories

## First Run Behavior

The embedding model downloads automatically on first use and is cached for subsequent runs. Handle download interruptions gracefully by clearing `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to allow re-download.
