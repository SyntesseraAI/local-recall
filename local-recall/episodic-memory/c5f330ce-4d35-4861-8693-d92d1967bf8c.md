# Transcript Collector Implementation

The `transcript-collector.ts` module provides utilities to parse Claude Code's JSONL transcript files into structured event objects.

## Functionality

- Reads `.jsonl` files from Claude's transcript directory
- Parses each JSON line into message events
- Structures events with type, content, and metadata
- Handles both user messages and assistant responses
- Extracts tool invocations and their results

## Usage

The transcript collector is used by the MCP server daemon to:
1. Load transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/<project-name>/transcripts/`
2. Parse them into structured events
3. Extract memories from the events
4. Track which transcripts have been processed (via content hash)

## Integration

Works with the memory extraction pipeline to identify meaningful knowledge from session interactions that should be persisted as memories.
