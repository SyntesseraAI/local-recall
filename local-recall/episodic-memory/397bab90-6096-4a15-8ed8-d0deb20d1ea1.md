The vector store implements semantic search using SQLite with sqlite-vec extension. Search results are ranked using:

- **Cosine distance similarity score** (0.0-1.0, rounded to 2 decimal places)
- **Recency tie-breaker**: When scores are equal, more recent memories (by `occurred_at`) are ranked first
- Results are sorted by score in descending order

This ensures both semantic relevance and temporal freshness in search results.
