The transcript collector searches for Claude transcripts in ~/.claude/projects/<project-name>/transcripts/. When setting up local-recall in a new repo, users cannot see if transcripts are being found because logging is only at DEBUG level. Added INFO-level logging to show:

1. **Search initialization**: Logs what path is being searched
2. **Directory existence checks**: Shows whether ~/.claude/projects exists
3. **Project folder detection**: Logs expected folder name based on cwd hash
4. **Results summary**: Shows how many transcripts were found and sync details

This helps users verify the transcript collection is working correctly in new repositories.
