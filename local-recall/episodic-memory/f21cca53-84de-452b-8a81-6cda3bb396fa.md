The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model with streaming enabled to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. The extraction is driven by a prompt defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. Key implementation details:

- Uses `Anthropic` client with streaming for efficient processing
- Processes transcripts to identify actionable insights
- Extracts memories with structured metadata (subject, keywords, applies_to, content)
- Handles memory deduplication and updates
- Integrates with the memory management system for persistence
