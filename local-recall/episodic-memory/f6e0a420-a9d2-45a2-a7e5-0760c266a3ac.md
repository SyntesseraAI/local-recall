The memory extraction system uses the Claude API (claude-opus model) to process transcripts and extract memories. It relies on structured prompts defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to generate consistent, well-formed memory objects. The extractor handles transcript processing, API communication, and memory persistence in a coordinated flow.
