The task is to extract relevant keywords from user-provided text and return them as a JSON array of strings. This is a basic text processing operation that requires identifying the most salient terms from the input.

Key points:
- Input is arbitrary user text
- Output must be valid JSON array of strings
- Keywords should be specific and searchable
- Focus on important/relevant terms, not generic words
