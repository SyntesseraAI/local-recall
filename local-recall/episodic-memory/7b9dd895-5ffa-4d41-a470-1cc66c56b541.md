The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses the Anthropic Claude API with streaming enabled to analyze transcripts and extract memories. The extraction is driven by a prompt template in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that instructs Claude to identify and structure valuable insights from session transcripts. This allows for intelligent, context-aware memory creation from conversation history.
