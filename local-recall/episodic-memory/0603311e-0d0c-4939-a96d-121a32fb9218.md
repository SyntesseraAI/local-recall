# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- The folder name is created by replacing slashes with dashes and removing leading/trailing dashes
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (JSON Lines format):
- Each line is a complete JSON object representing one message
- Files can be quite large with many messages
- Format is suitable for streaming and processing

## Integration with Local Recall

The transcript-collector module needs to:
1. Dynamically construct the project path from the working directory
2. Handle path transformations (slashes to dashes)
3. Parse JSONL format for transcript data
4. Filter for transcript files in the directory
