# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Directory Naming Convention

The project directory name is derived from the working directory path using a consistent encoding scheme that produces directory names like `01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`.

## Transcript File Organization

Within each project directory, transcripts are stored in a `transcripts/` subdirectory as individual JSON files, one per session.

This is relevant for the `TranscriptCollector` in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` which needs to sync transcripts from Claude's cache into the local-recall memory system.

## Implementation Details

The transcript collector should:
1. Read from `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-dir>/transcripts/`
2. Monitor for new/updated transcript files
3. Track processed transcripts by content hash to detect changes
4. Process transcript content to extract memories
