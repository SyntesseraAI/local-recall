Shifted from mutable knowledge base to episodic memory log. Memories are now:

- **Immutable**: Created once, never updated or deleted (only user manual removal)
- **Idempotent**: Deduplication via `occurred_at` + `content_hash` combination
- **Timestamped**: Two timestamps per memory:
  - `occurred_at`: When the conversation/event happened (from transcript)
  - `created_at`: When the memory file was written
  - `content_hash`: SHA-256 hash (16 chars) for dedup

This mirrors how human episodic memory works - recording what happened when, without modification.
