# Transcript Format and Parsing

Transcript files are in JSONL format where each line is a JSON object representing a transcript event.

## Message Structure

When parsing transcripts, messages are structured as objects with:
- `role`: The speaker role (e.g., "user", "assistant", "system")
- `content`: The actual message text or content

## Parsing Implementation

The transcript utility:
1. Reads JSONL files line by line
2. Parses each line as a JSON object
3. Extracts messages with their role and content
4. Returns an array of parsed message objects

## Use in Memory Extraction

This is used by the transcript daemon to:
1. Extract conversation context from transcripts
2. Identify significant events or learnings
3. Create memories based on the conversation flow
4. Associate memories with the correct timestamp (`occurred_at`)
