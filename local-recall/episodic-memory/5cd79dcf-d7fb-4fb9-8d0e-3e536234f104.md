Claude stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project directories are named with URL-encoded paths where slashes become dashes, matching the repo folder name. Example: `/Users/joe/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/` contains transcripts for the local-recall project. Each transcript is a JSONL file with object structure `{role, content}` per line.
