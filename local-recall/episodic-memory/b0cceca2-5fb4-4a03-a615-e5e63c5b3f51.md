The memory extractor module in src/core/memory-extractor.ts uses Claude Haiku model via the Claude API to analyze transcripts and extract memories. It leverages a structured prompt system defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts that guides the model to identify and format memories as JSON with proper metadata fields (subject, keywords, applies_to, content, etc.). This is a core component for converting session transcripts into persistent memories.
