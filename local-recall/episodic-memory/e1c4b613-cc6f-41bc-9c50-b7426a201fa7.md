The memory extraction system uses `claude -p` (via claude-p-wrapper package) to process transcripts with Claude Haiku model. This approach is used for:
- Extracting memories from session transcripts
- Processing user prompts to identify keywords
- Condensing transcripts for memory extraction

This design prioritizes efficiency and cost-effectiveness by using a smaller model (Haiku) for routine extraction tasks rather than full context analysis.
