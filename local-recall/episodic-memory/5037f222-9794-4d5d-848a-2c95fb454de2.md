The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku for lightweight, efficient processing of transcripts. The implementation makes direct API calls to Claude rather than using the `claude` CLI tool. The extraction uses streaming for the API response to handle large transcript content efficiently. The system prompt is defined in a separate file (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) and guides Claude to extract valuable memories from session transcripts.
