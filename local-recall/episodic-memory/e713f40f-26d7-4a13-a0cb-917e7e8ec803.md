The memory extraction system expects transcripts to be condensed into a standardized format with clear event markers:

- `[User]` - What the user asked or requested
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude said or explained
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This condensed format allows the extraction prompt to quickly identify what happened during a session and extract relevant memories without processing the full transcript. The system uses this structure to understand the session context and determine what knowledge should be preserved.
