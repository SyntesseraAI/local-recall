The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku (via `claude -p --model haiku`) to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. The extraction is driven by a specialized prompt stored in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides Claude to identify what's worth remembering from a coding session.

Key files:
- `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` - Main extraction logic
- `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` - Extraction prompt template

This approach allows flexible, intelligent memory extraction without hardcoding specific patterns.
