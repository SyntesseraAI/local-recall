# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files in the `transcripts/` directory, with one JSON object per line.

## Key Fields in Transcript Objects

- `type`: Event type (e.g., 'tool_invocation', 'assistant_message')
- `content`: The actual content of the message or tool invocation
- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp when the event occurred
- `tool_name`: Name of the tool (for tool invocations)
- Other fields vary by event type

## Usage in Memory Extraction

The transcript collector reads these files to extract memories that help future AI sessions understand what was done and learned.
