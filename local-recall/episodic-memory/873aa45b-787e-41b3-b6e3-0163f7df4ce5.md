Claude Code integration uses two main hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json`:

1. **SessionStart Hook**: Loads 5 most recent memories (sorted by occurred_at) on session start, full reload from disk (no vector store)
2. **UserPromptSubmit Hook**: Triggers lazy vector store initialization and performs semantic search on user prompts
3. **Stop Hook**: Currently disabled - memory extraction handled by MCP server daemon instead

Hooks are shell commands receiving JSON via stdin with session_id, transcript_path, cwd parameters.
