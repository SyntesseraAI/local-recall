Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json` and execute as shell commands receiving JSON via stdin. SessionStart hook loads 5 most recent memories (sorted by `occurred_at`) on session begin without using vector store to avoid slow initialization. UserPromptSubmit hook performs semantic search using vector embeddings when user submits a prompt. Stop hook is currently disabled - memory extraction is handled by the MCP server daemon instead.
