# VS Code Extension vs Claude Code Desktop Hook Support

The VS Code extension has different hook support compared to Claude Code desktop:
- **SessionStart hook**: Works ✓
- **UserPromptSubmit hook**: Works ✓  
- **Stop hook**: Does not trigger (or triggers conditionally)

This suggests the VS Code extension may:
- Not have full hook event coverage
- Only support certain hook types
- Trigger hooks differently than Claude Code desktop

When implementing features that depend on hooks, consider this platform difference and provide fallback mechanisms (like using MCP tools directly).
