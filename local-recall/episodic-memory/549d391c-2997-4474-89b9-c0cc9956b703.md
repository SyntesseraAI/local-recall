Local Recall migrated embedding models:

**Previous:** BGE-small-en-v1.5 (384 dimensions)
**Current:** nomic-embed-text (768 dimensions)

This change requires:
1. **Rebuilding vector indexes** - Old Orama indexes must be deleted (they're gitignored and auto-regenerated)
2. **Migration procedure** - Delete orama-episodic-index.json and orama-thinking-index.json to trigger rebuild
3. **Larger index files** - 768 dimensions means bigger JSON index files on disk
4. **Better semantic understanding** - Nomic model provides superior embedding quality for similarity search

This is documented in the troubleshooting section for users migrating from older versions.
