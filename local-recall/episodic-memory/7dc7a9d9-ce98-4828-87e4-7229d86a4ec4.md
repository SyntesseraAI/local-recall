The memory extractor (memory-extractor.ts) processes condensed transcripts that use standardized event markers:
- `[User]` - User requests/questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude responses/explanations  
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool outcomes

This condensed format makes it easier to extract meaningful memories without processing raw transcript data. The module parses these markers to understand the flow of conversation and tool usage.
