Local Recall is a persistent memory system that enables AI coding assistants to retain valuable information across sessions. Key aspects:

- Processes Claude Code session transcripts to extract actionable memories
- Stores memories as markdown files with YAML frontmatter metadata in local-recall/episodic-memory/
- Uses fuzzy search to retrieve relevant memories for future sessions
- Operates through Claude Code hooks and MCP server integration
- Memories are version-controlled and shareable among team members

The system distinguishes between different types of valuable information: architectural decisions, bug fixes and root causes, code patterns/conventions, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, and performance considerations.
