# Transcript Event Format

Claude Code transcripts use JSON Lines format where each line is a separate JSON object representing an event.

## Event Structure

Each event in a transcript contains:
- `role`: Either `"user"` or `"assistant"`
- `type`: Event type (e.g., `"message"`, `"tool_call"`, `"tool_result"`)
- `content`: The actual content of the event

## Event Types

Common event types include:
- `message`: Text messages from user or assistant
- `tool_call`: Tool invocations (e.g., Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep)
- `tool_result`: Results from tool execution

## Parsing

Transcripts should be read line-by-line and parsed as individual JSON objects, not as a single JSON array.
