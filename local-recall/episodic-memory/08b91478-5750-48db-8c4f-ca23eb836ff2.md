The Local Recall project extracts memories from Claude Code session transcripts to provide context to future AI assistants. The memory extraction process analyzes what was learned, what problems were solved, and what is specific to the codebase during each session. Extracted memories are stored in markdown files with YAML frontmatter and can be retrieved via semantic search.
