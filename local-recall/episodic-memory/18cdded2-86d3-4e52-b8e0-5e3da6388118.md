Memory extraction should follow specific guidelines:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Project-specific code patterns/conventions
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Trivial/obvious information
- Sensitive data (keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

Memories should be specific (file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes).
