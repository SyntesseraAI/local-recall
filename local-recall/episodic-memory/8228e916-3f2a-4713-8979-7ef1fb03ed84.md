The MCP server exposes tools: memory_create (idempotent), memory_get, memory_search (semantic), memory_list (with filtering), and index_rebuild (sync vector store with files). Server runs a background daemon that syncs transcripts from Claude cache and extracts memories every 5 minutes. Stop hook is currently disabled - memory extraction is handled by MCP daemon instead.
