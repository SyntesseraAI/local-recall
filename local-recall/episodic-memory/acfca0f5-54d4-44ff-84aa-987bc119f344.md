The local-recall plugin deploys to `~/.claude/plugins/cache/local-recall-marketplace/local-recall/{version}/` with bundled dependencies. When the MCP server is updated (especially after fixing bundling), the version number must be bumped in both `package.json` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to force a fresh deployment. Without a version bump, Claude instances will continue using the cached outdated version. The bundled server.js includes all dependencies (~1.1MB) since node_modules aren't shipped with plugins.
