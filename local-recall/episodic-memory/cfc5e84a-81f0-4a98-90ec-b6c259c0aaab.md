The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to analyze session transcripts and identify valuable memories. The extraction uses a structured prompt defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides Claude to extract memories based on specific criteria (what was learned, what is now known, what is specific to the codebase, what problems were solved). The prompt includes detailed guidelines for memory extraction including scope classification (global, file:, area:) and filtering rules to avoid extracting generic knowledge or temporary debugging steps.
