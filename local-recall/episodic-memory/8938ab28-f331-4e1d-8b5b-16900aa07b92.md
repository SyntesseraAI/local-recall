The memory-extractor module in src/core/memory-extractor.ts processes transcripts to automatically create memories. It uses Claude Haiku to extract structured memories from condensed transcripts. Key features:

- `extractMemoriesFromTranscript()` - Main function that condenses transcript, extracts memories, and stores them
- Uses `claude -p` (claude prompt) to call Claude Haiku for memory extraction
- Implements deduplication via `findDuplicate()` before creating memories
- Condenses transcripts before extraction to reduce token usage
- Handles both single and batch memory creation
- Memory extraction prompt is in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts

This module is critical for the MCP server's background daemon functionality and automated memory creation from session transcripts.
