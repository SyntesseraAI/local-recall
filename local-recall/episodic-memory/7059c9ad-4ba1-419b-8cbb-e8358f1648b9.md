Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools (via MCP) to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files stored locally in the repository. The system uses a plugin architecture with hooks for SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, and Stop events, combined with an MCP server for memory tool access.
