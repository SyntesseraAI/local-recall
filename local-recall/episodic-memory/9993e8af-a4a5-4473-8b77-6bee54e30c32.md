Transcripts are condensed into structured events with the following format:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool calls

This condensed format makes transcripts more suitable for memory extraction by focusing on high-level activities rather than complete conversation details.
