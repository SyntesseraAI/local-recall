# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path by:
1. Taking the absolute path (e.g., `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`)
2. URL-encoding it (replacing `/` with `%2F`, and other special chars)
3. Base64 encoding the result

Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes a folder name like `L1VzZXJzL2pvZS9Db2RlL1N5bnRlc3NlcmEvbG9jYWwtcmVjYWxs`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line) containing:
- Session events (user messages, assistant responses, tool calls)
- Metadata (timestamps, tool invocations, results)
- Full conversation history

## Usage

This information is important for:
- Building tools that process Claude Code transcripts
- Understanding how to access and parse session history
- Implementing memory extraction from transcripts
- Debugging issues related to project-specific data
