# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path, with slashes and colons encoded as forward slashes.

Example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files in a `transcripts/` subdirectory:
- Format: JSON Lines (one JSON object per line)
- Naming: Sequential numeric names like `0.jsonl`, `1.jsonl`, etc.
- Path: `~/.claude/projects/<project-path>/transcripts/`

## Relevance to Local Recall

The MCP server background daemon processes these transcripts:
1. Syncs transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
2. Processes them using `claude -p` to extract memories
3. Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
4. Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
5. Runs every 5 minutes
