The codebase implements transcript condensing as a preprocessing step before memory extraction. This reduces the size of transcripts sent to Claude Haiku for analysis, lowering token usage and improving performance. The condensed format includes events like [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], and [Result: OK/ERROR] to capture the essential information without full tool output.
