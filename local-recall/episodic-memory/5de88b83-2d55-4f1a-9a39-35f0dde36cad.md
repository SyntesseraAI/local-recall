The SessionStart hook is triggered when a Claude Code session begins and:
1. Reads the 5 most recent memories directly from files (sorted by `occurred_at`)
2. Outputs memory content to stdout
3. Gets injected into Claude's context at session start

This provides quick context awareness without needing semantic search, using recent memories as high-signal starting point.
