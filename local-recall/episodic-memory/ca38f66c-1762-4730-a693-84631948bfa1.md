The MCP server is configured and running from `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/mcp-server/server.js`, not from the main project root. The main project root doesn't have a built `scripts/` directory structure yet.

The MCP server config is located at `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.mcp.json`. When working on the main project, remember the actual running instance is in the plugin subdirectory.
