The Local Recall project has three main components:
1. **Hooks** (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop) - Triggered by Claude Code events to inject memory context
2. **MCP Server** - Exposes memory tools for clients, runs background daemon processing transcripts
3. **Memory System** - Core modules: memory.ts (CRUD), vector-store.ts (semantic search with SQLite), embedding.ts (fastembed), search.ts, and types.ts

Memory files are stored in episodic-memory/ and use YAML frontmatter with content hashing for deduplication.
