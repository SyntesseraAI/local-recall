Local Recall integrates with Claude Code through three hooks:

1. **SessionStart Hook** (`src/hooks/session-start.ts`)
   - Triggered when a Claude Code session begins
   - Loads memory index from `local-recall/index.json`
   - Searches for relevant memories based on context (files, areas)
   - Outputs memories to stdout for injection into Claude's context
   - Shows index statistics

2. **UserPromptSubmit Hook** (`src/hooks/user-prompt-submit.ts`)
   - Triggered when user submits a prompt before Claude processes it
   - Performs semantic search on memories relevant to the prompt
   - Filters results and injects into context

3. **Stop Hook** (`src/hooks/stop.ts`)
   - Handles session cleanup and memory processing
   - Can trigger memory extraction from transcripts

All hooks work with the vector-backed memory system to provide context-aware information injection.
