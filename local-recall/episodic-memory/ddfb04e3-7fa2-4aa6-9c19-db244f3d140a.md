Three Claude Code hooks integrate Local Recall:
1. SessionStart: Loads 5 most recent memories (full reload, no vector store to avoid slow initialization)
2. UserPromptSubmit: Semantic search using vector embeddings on user prompt
3. Stop: Currently disabled - memory extraction handled asynchronously by MCP server daemon every 5 minutes

Hooks are configured in hooks.json and receive JSON via stdin, output memory content to stdout.
