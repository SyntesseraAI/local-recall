The vector store is implemented in `src/core/vector-store.ts` using:
- `better-sqlite3` for database management
- `sqlite-vec` extension for vector similarity search
- `fastembed` with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for embeddings (~133MB)

Search results use cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0, rounded to 2 decimal places). When scores are equal, recency (occurred_at) acts as a tie-breaker. The embedding model is cached in `local_cache/` and downloads on first use (30-60 seconds).
