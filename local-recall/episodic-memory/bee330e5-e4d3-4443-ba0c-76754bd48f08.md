When storing condensed transcripts, system prompts and analysis instructions (like `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]`) should be filtered out before persisting. This prevents the memory extraction system from re-processing its own prompts in future sessions, which causes exponential growth in transcript size and infinite recursion.
