Memory files are markdown with YAML frontmatter stored in local-recall/episodic-memory/*.md. Each memory should be atomic (one concept per file). Scope field determines applicability:
- `global` - applies to entire codebase
- `file:<path>` - specific to a file (e.g., file:src/utils/config.ts)
- `area:<name>` - related to a component area (e.g., area:authentication)

Keywords should be specific, lowercase, and 1-10 per memory for searchability.
