# Memory Extraction Feature Request

The user (Joe) wants to implement memory extraction from condensed transcripts in the session-start hook. This is a new feature to add to the local-recall system.

## Context

- Current status: Session-start hook loads memory index but doesn't extract new memories
- Goal: Extract valuable memories from condensed transcripts automatically
- Implementation: Should work with the transcript-collector's condensing feature
- Impact: Enables automatic memory creation from session transcripts

## Next Steps

- Review transcript-condensing implementation in src/core/transcript-collector.ts
- Design memory extraction from condensed transcripts
- Implement extraction in session-start or via separate mechanism
- Consider how to avoid duplicate memories from the same session
