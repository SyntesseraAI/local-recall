Claude transcripts with thinking blocks are located in both `~/.claude/projects/*/transcripts/` and locally synced copies in the project directory. Not all transcripts contain thinking blocks - inspection via `grep '"type":"thinking"'` is needed to find valid examples. The most recent session transcripts may be in `~/.claude/projects/` while processed/synced copies are in the local-recall project folder.
