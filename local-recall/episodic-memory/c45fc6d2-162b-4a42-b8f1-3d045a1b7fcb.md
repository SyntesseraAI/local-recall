The memory extraction process uses [LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL] markers to identify transcript sections that should be analyzed for memory creation. The transcript is condensed into events with [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], and [Result: OK/ERROR] formats. This structure helps identify what was learned, problems solved, and codebase-specific knowledge during Claude Code sessions.
