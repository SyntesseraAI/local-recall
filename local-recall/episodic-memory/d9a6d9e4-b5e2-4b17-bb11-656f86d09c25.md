Three hooks are configured: SessionStart (loads memory index when session begins), UserPromptSubmit (searches memories based on user prompt before Claude processes), and Stop hook (currently disabled - memory extraction handled by MCP server daemon running every 5 minutes). Hooks are shell commands that receive JSON via stdin.
