The memory extraction system uses carefully crafted prompts to guide Claude in analyzing transcripts. The prompts:

- Provide context about the Local Recall project and its purpose
- Include guidelines on what constitutes valuable memories vs. trivial information
- Specify memory format requirements (subject, keywords, applies_to, content)
- Define scope categories: global, file:<path>, area:<name>
- Include examples of good and bad memory extraction
- Emphasize being specific, concise, and actionable
- Explicitly exclude generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and sensitive data
