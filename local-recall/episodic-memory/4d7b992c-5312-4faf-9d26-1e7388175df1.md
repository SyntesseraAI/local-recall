The BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model is downloaded automatically on first use and cached in `local_cache/`. This initial download can take 30-60 seconds and is approximately 133MB. Subsequent runs load from cache, which is much faster. If the cache becomes corrupted, removing `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` will trigger re-download on next run.
