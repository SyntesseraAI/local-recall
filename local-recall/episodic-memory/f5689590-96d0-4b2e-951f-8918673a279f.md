# Development Requirements for Local Recall

Per CLAUDE.md, these are ALWAYS requirements:

## Testing
- All new features must have corresponding unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests go in `tests/integration/`
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases

## Documentation
- Documentation must be placed in the `docs/` folder
- Update existing docs when modifying functionality
- Code should be self-documenting where possible

## Code Quality
- Use TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- Keep changes focused on the specific task

These requirements should be followed strictly when contributing to or modifying the Local Recall project.
