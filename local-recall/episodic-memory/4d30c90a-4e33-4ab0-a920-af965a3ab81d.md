The system supports independent configuration for episodic and thinking memories through environment variables or .local-recall.json file. Each memory type has configurable: enabled status, max tokens to inject per prompt, and minimum similarity threshold (0.0-1.0). Default thresholds are 0.5 and default max tokens are 1000 for both types.
