The vector store (`src/core/vector-store.ts`) uses:
- `better-sqlite3` with `sqlite-vec` extension for vector similarity
- `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB)
- Cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0)
- Scores rounded to 2 decimal places
- Results sorted by score descending with recency tie-breaker (occurred_at)

Model auto-downloads to `local_cache/` on first use. First startup may take 30-60 seconds.
