When Ollama embedding fails with errors like "Post \"http://127.0.0.1:49889/embedding\": EOF", the port (49889) is Ollama's internal subprocess communication port, not the main API port (11434). This indicates a problem internal to Ollama itself, not the embedding service URL configuration.

These errors often mean the model subprocess crashed or ran out of resources. Check Ollama logs for context window warnings or resource issues rather than investigating the ephemeral port.
