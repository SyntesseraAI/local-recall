Added comprehensive tests for field name normalization in memory-extractor.test.ts covering:
- Alternative field names (title, tags, scope, text)
- Multiple invalid field combinations
- Proper handling of normalized fields in validation

These tests ensure the normalization logic handles all common variations Claude might return without validation errors.
