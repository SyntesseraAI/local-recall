The vector store (`src/core/vector-store.ts`) is SQLite-backed and uses the `sqlite-vec` extension with `better-sqlite3`. Embeddings are generated using `fastembed` with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). Search uses cosine distance with scores 0.0-1.0 (rounded to 2 decimal places), sorted descending with recency as tie-breaker. The vector store is lazy-initialized and not used for session-start hook to avoid slow initialization.
