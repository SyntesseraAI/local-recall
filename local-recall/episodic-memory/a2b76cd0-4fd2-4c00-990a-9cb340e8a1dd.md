# Transcript Collection and Memory Extraction

The local-recall system includes a transcript collector that:
1. Monitors Claude Code transcripts stored in `~/.claude/projects/`
2. Processes them asynchronously via MCP server daemon
3. Extracts memories from the transcript content
4. Runs every 5 minutes to catch new transcripts

The Stop hook is currently disabled because transcript processing is handled by the background MCP server daemon instead, which provides more robust asynchronous processing.

## Key Files
- `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` - Main transcript collection logic
- Processes transcripts to extract valuable memories for future sessions
