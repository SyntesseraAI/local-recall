Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json` with structure: `{ "hooks": { "SessionStart": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ./dist/hooks/session-start.js", "timeout": 30 }] }] } }`. Hook processes receive JSON via stdin and must output to stdout within the timeout period (in seconds).
