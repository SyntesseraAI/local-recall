The memory extraction prompt provides clear guidelines about what to extract from transcripts:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that would become outdated quickly

The prompt also guides scope selection: `global` for codebase-wide knowledge, `file:<path>` for file-specific insights, and `area:<name>` for component-related memories.
