# Transcript Format and Event Structure

Transcripts in local-recall are stored as JSONL files (JSON Lines format) with each line representing a single event.

## Event Types

The transcript contains different types of events:
- User messages and requests
- Assistant responses and explanations
- Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- Tool results and outcomes (OK/ERROR)

## Event Structure

Each line is a valid JSON object representing a single event in the conversation. This structure allows for:
- Efficient streaming and line-by-line processing
- Easy filtering by event type
- Condensed representation without data duplication
- Extraction of specific interactions for memory creation

## Processing Pipeline

The transcript-collector module reads these JSONL files and processes them to extract meaningful memories using Claude Haiku for keyword extraction.
