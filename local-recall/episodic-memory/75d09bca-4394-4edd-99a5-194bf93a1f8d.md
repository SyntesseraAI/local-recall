The vector store (src/core/vector-store.ts) uses better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings are generated using fastembed with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). The model is automatically cached in local_cache/ on first use and subsequent runs load from cache. First startup may take 30-60 seconds for model download.
