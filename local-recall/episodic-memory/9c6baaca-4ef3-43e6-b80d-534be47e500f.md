# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Slashes (/) are replaced with hyphens (-)
- The resulting folder contains transcript files in JSONL format

## Example

For working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`:
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`
- Transcripts stored as: `transcripts/*.jsonl`

## Relevance

This is important for the transcript-collector component which needs to locate and process Claude's transcript files for memory extraction.
