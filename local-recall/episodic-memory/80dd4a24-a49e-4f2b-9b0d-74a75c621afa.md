# Memory Extraction from Transcripts

The MCP server background daemon processes Claude Code session transcripts to extract memories that help future AI assistants.

## Key Principles

- **Extract specific, actionable insights** - Include file paths, function names, and concrete details
- **Focus on learnings** - Architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configurations
- **Use appropriate scope** - `global` (entire codebase), `file:<path>` (specific file), `area:<name>` (component)
- **Avoid generic knowledge** - Don't extract obvious programming concepts
- **Avoid temporary debugging** - Only extract insights that are useful long-term

## What Makes Good Memories

- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Project-specific code patterns or conventions
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
