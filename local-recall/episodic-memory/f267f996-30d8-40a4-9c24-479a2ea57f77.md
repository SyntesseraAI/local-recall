The Stop hook is disabled in the current implementation. Memory extraction is handled by an MCP server daemon that runs in the background and processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes.

**Process:**
- The daemon syncs transcripts from Claude's cache
- Processes transcripts to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change

**Note:** This is documented in CLAUDE.md but the actual implementation may need review to ensure it's working correctly.
