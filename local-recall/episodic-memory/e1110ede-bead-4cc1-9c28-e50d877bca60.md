Local Recall implements a hybrid search approach:

1. **Keyword-based search** - Fuzzy matching against indexed keywords from memory files
2. **Semantic search** - Using embeddings (BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for meaning-based retrieval

The keyword approach is used in hooks for quick filtering, while semantic search can be used in the MCP server for deeper understanding.

This dual approach allows:
- Fast keyword-based matching for immediate recall needs
- Semantic understanding for finding memories that aren't explicitly tagged with relevant keywords
- Flexibility in how Claude Code and other tools search for relevant context
