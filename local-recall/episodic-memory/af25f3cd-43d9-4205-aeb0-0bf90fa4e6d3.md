Local Recall can be installed as:
1. npm package: installed to `node_modules/local-recall/scripts/`
2. Direct clone: cloned locally and added to `.claude/settings.json`

Hooks use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable to reference correct paths. The `cwd` is passed via stdin to operate on user's project directory.
