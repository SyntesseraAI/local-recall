The vector store is backed by SQLite using the sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings are generated with fastembed library using BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). The model is cached in `local_cache/` after first download (takes 30-60 seconds initially).

Key methods: initialize(), add(memory), remove(id), search(query, options), sync(memories)

Scoring uses cosine distance (0.0-1.0), rounded to 2 decimals, with recency tie-breaker.
