Memory files use the `applies_to` field to specify their scope:
- `global` - Applies to the entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

This scoping system helps the search and retrieval system find relevant memories based on the current working context, ensuring recommendations are appropriately targeted.
