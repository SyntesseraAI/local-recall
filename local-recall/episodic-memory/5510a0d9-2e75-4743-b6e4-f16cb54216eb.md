The memory extraction prompts in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` define clear guidance for what memories should be extracted from transcripts:

**What to extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations

**What NOT to extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

**Scope selection (applies_to):**
- Use `global` for architecture and conventions
- Use `file:<path>` for file-specific discoveries
- Use `area:<name>` for component-related knowledge

Memories must be specific (include file paths, function names), concise (one concept), and actionable (help avoid mistakes).
