The system uses transcript condensing to make full session transcripts suitable for memory extraction analysis. The condensed format includes:

- `[User]` - User queries or requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This condensed format is more efficient for Claude to analyze while retaining essential context about what happened during the session.
