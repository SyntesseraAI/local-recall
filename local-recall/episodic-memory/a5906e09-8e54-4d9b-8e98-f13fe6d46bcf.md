Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files stored in the repository. It uses fastembed (BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic search with SQLite vector store. Memories are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory and are version-controlled in git.
