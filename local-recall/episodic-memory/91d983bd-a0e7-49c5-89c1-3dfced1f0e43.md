The local-recall folder's `.gitignore` file is auto-generated when the memory system is initialized. It must include entries for:

1. `transcripts/` - Directory containing Claude Code session transcripts
2. `processed-log.json` - File that tracks which transcripts have been processed to avoid reprocessing

These entries are defined in two places that must be kept in sync:
- `src/core/index.ts` - Template for auto-generation
- `src/core/memory.ts` - Backup template definition

The existing `.gitignore` file at `local-recall/.gitignore` won't be automatically regenerated, so it must be manually updated when adding new entries.
