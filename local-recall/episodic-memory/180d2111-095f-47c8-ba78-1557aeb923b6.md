The memory extraction system analyzes condensed transcripts to identify and create memories from coding sessions:
- Parses condensed transcript events
- Identifies learnings, discoveries, and solved problems
- Creates structured memories with appropriate scope (global, file-specific, or area-specific)
- Used by the Stop hook to automatically create memories from session activity

Memories should be specific, actionable, and focused on insights that help future sessions work more efficiently.
