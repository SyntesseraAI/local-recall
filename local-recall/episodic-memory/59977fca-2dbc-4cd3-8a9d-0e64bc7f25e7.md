Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows multiple AI agents (Claude Code, MCP clients) to store, retrieve, and share contextual information about codebases across sessions. All memories are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory and are version-controlled in git.
