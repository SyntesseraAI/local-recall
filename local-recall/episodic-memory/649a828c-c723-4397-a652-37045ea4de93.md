The migration from sqlite-vec to Orama (pure JavaScript vector store) has successfully resolved mutex contention issues that were occurring in hooks. Orama is pure JavaScript with no native dependencies, eliminating the process isolation and mutex problems that sqlite-vec had when running in hook processes. Hooks now complete cleanly without mutex errors.
