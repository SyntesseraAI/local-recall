# String Quote Standardization and Logging in user-prompt-submit Hook

Recent refactoring (commit 5d8310f) standardized string quotes and improved logging consistency in the user-prompt-submit hook.

## Changes Applied

1. Standardized all string quotes to single quotes for consistency
2. Enhanced logging output to provide better visibility into hook execution
3. Improved debug messages for keyword extraction and memory search operations

## Context

These changes are part of broader code quality improvements to maintain consistency across the codebase and make debugging easier during development and production.
