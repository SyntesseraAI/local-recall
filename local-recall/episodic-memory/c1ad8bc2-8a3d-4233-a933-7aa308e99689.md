# Memory Extraction from Session Transcripts

The local-recall system extracts valuable memories by analyzing Claude Code session transcripts. This process:

1. **Identifies Learning Opportunities**: Searches transcripts for new knowledge, bug fixes, architectural decisions, and code patterns
2. **Focuses on Actionable Information**: Extracts details that help future assistants work more efficiently
3. **Uses Appropriate Scope**: Classifies memories as global, file-specific, or area-specific based on applicability
4. **Avoids Noise**: Excludes generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and trivial information

This allows the system to build a knowledge base that improves over time as more coding sessions occur.
