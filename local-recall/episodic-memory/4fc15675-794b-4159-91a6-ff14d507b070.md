When extracting memories from session transcripts, be selective about what to preserve:

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps that aren't useful long-term
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that would become outdated quickly

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to this project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during the session
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

This ensures memories remain valuable and actionable for future AI assistants working on the codebase.
