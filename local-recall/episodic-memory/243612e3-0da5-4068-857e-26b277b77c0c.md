# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path to the project directory, with slashes replaced by dashes and special characters escaped. For example:

- Project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcripts stored at `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Implications for local-recall

The MCP server's background daemon must account for this path transformation when syncing transcripts. The actual path to transcripts will use dashes instead of slashes.

## References

This information was discovered when investigating where Claude Code stores project transcripts for the local-recall memory system.
