# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The memory extraction pipeline uses transcript condensing to reduce token usage when extracting memories from long transcripts.

## Implementation

Transcript condensing compresses transcript content into a more compact format with key events:
- `[User]` - User questions or requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool outcomes

This condensed format is then passed to Claude for memory extraction instead of the full transcript, reducing tokens needed while preserving the essential information about what happened during the session.

## Benefits

- Significantly reduces token usage for long sessions
- Preserves context needed for memory extraction
- Enables faster processing of transcripts
