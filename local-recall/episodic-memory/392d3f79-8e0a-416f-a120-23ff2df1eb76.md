When analyzing a Claude Code session transcript for memory extraction, the transcript being analyzed is from the CURRENT session being processed, not from some previously recorded session. This is an important distinction because it means memories should be extracted from what was just accomplished in this specific session, which helps the system learn incrementally from each interaction.
