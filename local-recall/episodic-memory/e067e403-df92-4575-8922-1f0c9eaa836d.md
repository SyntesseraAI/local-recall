# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

When extracting memories from transcripts, the MCP server first condenses transcripts before sending them to Claude Haiku.

## Process

1. **Transcript Collection**: Gathers complete transcript from Claude's cache
2. **Condensing**: Reduces transcript length by summarizing events while preserving important information
3. **Claude Haiku Processing**: Sends condensed transcript to Claude Haiku for memory extraction
4. **Memory Creation**: Creates individual memory files from extracted insights

## Benefits

- Reduces token usage by condensing verbose transcripts
- Maintains important context while removing noise
- Faster processing of long sessions
- More focused memory extraction from key events

## Implementation

Condensing happens in the transcript collection/processing pipeline, likely in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`.
