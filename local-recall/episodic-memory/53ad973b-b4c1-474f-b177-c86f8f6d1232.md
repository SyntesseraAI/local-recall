Local Recall integrates with Claude Code via three hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json`: SessionStart hook loads 5 most recent memories on session start, UserPromptSubmit hook performs semantic search before processing user input, Stop hook is currently disabled (memory extraction now handled by MCP server daemon). Hooks receive JSON via stdin and output memories to stdout for context injection.
