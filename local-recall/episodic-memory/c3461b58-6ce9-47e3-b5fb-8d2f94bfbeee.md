Memory extraction happens asynchronously via the MCP server daemon rather than through the Stop hook. The daemon runs every 5 minutes, syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, processes them using `claude -p`, and manages memory lifecycle (creating new memories, deleting stale ones when transcripts change). Tracks processed transcripts using content hashes for change detection.
