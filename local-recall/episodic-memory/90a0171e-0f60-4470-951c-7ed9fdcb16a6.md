The memory extractor sends transcripts to Claude Haiku using a structured prompt that:
1. Takes the transcript content as input
2. Asks Claude to identify valuable memories to extract
3. Returns structured JSON with memory metadata (subject, keywords, applies_to, content)
4. Handles API responses and creates memory files with deduplicated content

The extraction process is critical for the local-recall system to automatically create memories from coding sessions without manual intervention.
