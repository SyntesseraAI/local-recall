The Stop hook is currently disabled. Instead, memory extraction is handled by the MCP server's background daemon which:
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
- Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
- Runs every 5 minutes

This asynchronous approach prevents blocking the user session.
