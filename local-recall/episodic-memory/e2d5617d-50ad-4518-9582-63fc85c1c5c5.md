The session uses transcript condensing as a preprocessing step before memory extraction. This optimization:
- Reduces token count by summarizing transcript events
- Maintains essential information while removing redundancy
- Improves memory extraction quality by providing cleaner input
- Is implemented in the memory extraction pipeline

This pattern should be applied consistently when processing transcripts to maximize efficiency.
