# Memory Extraction with Claude Haiku

The memory extraction pipeline uses the Claude Haiku model to intelligently analyze condensed transcripts.

## Process

1. Transcripts are condensed to key events
2. Condensed transcript is sent to Claude Haiku for analysis
3. Haiku extracts:
   - Keywords for the memory (searchable terms)
   - Memory subject (brief one-line description)
   - Scope determination (global, file-specific, or area-specific)

## Benefits

- More intelligent keyword extraction than simple string matching
- Understands context to identify truly relevant search terms
- Determines appropriate scope (global vs file vs area) based on content
- Reduces noise by filtering trivial or temporary information

## Implementation

The feature is integrated in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` and uses the Claude API to process transcripts. The model is chosen for its speed and cost-effectiveness while maintaining quality analysis.
