# User Preference: Memory Extraction from Transcript Analysis

The user is implementing a feature to extract memories from transcript keyword extraction task, where Claude analyzes a condensed transcript and extracts valuable memories.

## Context

This is part of the LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL task which:
1. Analyzes Claude Code session transcripts
2. Extracts keyword summaries from the transcript content
3. Returns keywords as JSON array format
4. These keywords are then used for memory extraction

## Implementation Detail

The user appears to be testing or implementing the transcript-condensing and memory-extraction pipeline, possibly as part of the MCP server's background daemon or hook processing.
