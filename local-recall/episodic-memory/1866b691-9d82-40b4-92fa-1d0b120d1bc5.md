# Transcript Event Structure

Claude Code transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files where each line represents a single event.

## Standard Event Fields

Each event in a transcript contains:
- `type`: The type of event (e.g., 'message')
- `role`: The participant role ('user' or 'assistant')
- `content`: The actual message/response content
- Additional metadata fields depending on event type

## Message Content

For 'message' type events, the content is typically a string containing:
- User queries and requests
- Assistant responses and explanations
- Tool invocations and results

## Processing Considerations

When processing transcripts:
- Each line is independent JSON and must be parsed separately
- The sequence of events in order reflects the conversation flow
- Tool invocations are embedded within message content
- This format allows for streaming and incremental processing

## Location Reference

See memory about Claude project transcripts location on macOS for path details.
