Claude transcripts store thinking blocks as separate JSONL entries, each with a `type: "thinking"` field and associated `msg_*` message ID. Multiple thinking blocks can have the same message ID, indicating they belong to the same Claude response. The transcript files are newline-delimited JSON where each line represents a single content chunk or event.
