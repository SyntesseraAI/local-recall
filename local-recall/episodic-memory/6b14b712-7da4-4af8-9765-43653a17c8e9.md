# JSONL Transcript Format

Claude Code transcripts use JSON Lines format (.jsonl) rather than plain text logs.

## Format Details

- File extension: `.jsonl`
- Each line contains one complete JSON object
- No comma between lines (standard JSONL format)
- Each object is a complete event with all metadata

## Advantages

- Structured data allows programmatic parsing
- Each event is self-contained with full context
- Can process line-by-line without loading entire file
- Supports rich metadata beyond plain text

## Parsing Approach

When reading transcripts:
1. Split by newlines
2. Parse each line with `JSON.parse()`
3. Handle empty lines gracefully
4. Process complete events with all context available

This is more robust than text parsing and allows extracting detailed information from tool invocations, results, and conversation flow.
