The memory extraction system implements a specific protocol [LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL] for analyzing transcripts. The protocol provides:

1. Clear instructions on what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns)
2. Guidelines on what NOT to extract (generic knowledge, temporary steps, sensitive data)
3. JSON output format requirements with specific fields: subject, keywords, applies_to, content
4. Scope categorization: `global`, `file:<path>`, `area:<name>`
5. Emphasis on being specific, concise, and actionable

This structure is used consistently throughout the codebase for memory extraction tasks.
