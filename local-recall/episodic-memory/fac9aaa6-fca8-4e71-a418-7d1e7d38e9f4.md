The memory extraction pipeline includes a transcript condensing step that preprocesses raw transcripts before sending them to Claude for memory extraction. This condensing:

1. Reduces transcript size and noise by extracting only valuable events
2. Formats events in a standardized way:
   - `[User]` - User requests or questions
   - `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
   - `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, etc.)
   - `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool outcomes
3. Removes verbose logging, intermediate debugging steps, and redundant information
4. Preserves the essential context needed for memory extraction
5. Makes the transcript more focused on actual work and decisions rather than tool execution details

This condensed format is what gets fed to the memory extraction prompt, improving the quality and relevance of extracted memories.
