Memory extraction from transcripts should focus on extracting memories about: (1) what was learned (new knowledge/insights), (2) what is now known (important facts about codebase), (3) what is specific to this codebase (unique patterns/quirks), and (4) what problems were solved (bug fixes, issues resolved, and how). This ensures extracted memories are actionable and helpful for future sessions.
