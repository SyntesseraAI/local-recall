# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path of the project directory with forward slashes replaced by dashes and non-alphanumeric characters replaced by underscores.

Example:
- Project at: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSON Lines (.jsonl) files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory:
- Each line is a complete JSON object representing one message
- Files are named by date: `YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`
- Contains full conversation history including tool invocations and results

## Content Structure

Each transcript message typically includes:
- `role`: "user" or "assistant"
- `type`: message type
- `content`: the actual message text
- `timestamp`: when the message was created
- Tool invocations include the command and results
