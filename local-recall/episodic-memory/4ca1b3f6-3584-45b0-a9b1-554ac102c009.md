# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

## Problem
Using raw transcripts with Claude Haiku for memory extraction is inefficient:
- Raw transcripts are verbose (contain all tool outputs, intermediate steps)
- Results in higher token usage for memory extraction
- Slower processing in background daemon

## Solution
Implement transcript condensing that:
1. Removes verbose tool outputs and execution details
2. Keeps only user requests and assistant summaries
3. Maintains conversation flow and context
4. Reduces file size significantly

## Implementation Details
Condensed transcripts focus on:
- User prompts and requests
- Assistant explanations and decisions
- Key findings and conclusions
- Omit: Full tool results, error messages, intermediate debugging

## Result
Reduced token usage makes memory extraction more cost-effective and faster, improving the overall efficiency of the background daemon that runs every 5 minutes.
