Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The folder names are path-encoded versions of the project working directory, using dashes instead of slashes. Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) with one event per line.

## Example
- Project at: `/Users/joe/Code/MyProject`
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-MyProject/transcripts/`
- Transcript files: `*.jsonl`

This information is critical for the MCP server daemon which syncs and processes transcripts asynchronously.
