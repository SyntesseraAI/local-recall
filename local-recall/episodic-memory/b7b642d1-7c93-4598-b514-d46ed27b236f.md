The `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` file contains carefully crafted prompts that guide Claude Haiku in extracting memories from transcripts. These prompts define:

- What constitutes valuable memories
- How to structure memory metadata
- Guidelines for keyword selection
- Scope determination (global vs file-specific vs area-specific)
- Content formatting in markdown

This prompt structure ensures consistent and high-quality memory extraction across all sessions.
