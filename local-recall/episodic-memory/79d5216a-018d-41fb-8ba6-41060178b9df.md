Data enters the SQLite vector store through three pathways: (1) On memory creation - when `MemoryManager.createMemory()` writes a markdown file, it immediately calls `vectorStore.add(memory)` to generate embedding and insert into SQLite; (2) MCP tools sync - when episodic/thinking search tools are called, they sync memories via `vectorStore.sync(memories)`; (3) Daemon sync in MCP server - the background daemon calls `vectorStore.sync(memories)` to ensure the vector store matches file-based memories.
