The `.gitignore` file created in the `local-recall/` directory should contain entries to ignore:
- `orama-*-index.json` - Auto-generated vector indexes (episodic and thinking)
- `recall.log` - Debug log file

These files are auto-generated at runtime and should not be committed to version control. The `.gitignore` is created automatically by `ensureGitignore()` which is called every session start.

**Context**: Memory files themselves (in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` and `local-recall/thinking-memory/`) ARE version-controlled and should not be ignored.
