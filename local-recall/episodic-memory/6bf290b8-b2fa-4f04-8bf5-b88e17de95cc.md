The session-start hook performs a **full reload** of all memories on every session, not a delta. In `src/hooks/session-start.ts:57-63`, a fresh `MemoryManager` instance is created and all memories are listed. Only the 5 most recent memories (sorted by `occurred_at` descending) are selected for session context injection.

This approach is simpler than delta tracking but means all memories are re-read from disk on every session start, even though only 5 are used.
