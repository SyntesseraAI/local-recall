# Claude Code Transcript Storage

Claude Code stores session transcripts in the user's home directory under `~/.claude/projects/`. The directory structure uses URL-encoded project paths to handle special characters in project names and paths.

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files with the format: `transcript_<timestamp>.jsonl`

This is the mechanism that local-recall uses to collect transcripts for memory extraction via the MCP server daemon.
