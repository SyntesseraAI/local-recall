Extraction prompts are maintained in a dedicated `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` module. This separation allows for easy updates to the extraction logic and guidelines without modifying the core extractor code. The prompts contain detailed instructions for identifying valuable memories, scope selection, and output formatting.
