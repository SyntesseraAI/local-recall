The memory extraction logic is guided by a detailed prompt stored in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This prompt provides:

1. **Context**: Explains that memories help future AI assistants working on the codebase
2. **Guidelines**: Specific rules about what to extract and what to avoid
3. **Format instructions**: Detailed JSON schema for memory objects
4. **Scope definitions**: Clear explanation of `global`, `file:<path>`, and `area:<name>` scopes
5. **What to extract/avoid**: Lists of do's and don'ts for memory content

The prompt is designed to ensure extracted memories are:
- Specific and actionable
- Focused on architectural decisions, bug fixes, and codebase patterns
- Properly scoped to their relevance area
- Free of sensitive data and generic knowledge

This separation of concerns (prompt in separate file) allows for easy iteration on extraction quality without modifying the core logic.
