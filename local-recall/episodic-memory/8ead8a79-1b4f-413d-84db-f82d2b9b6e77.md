The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to analyze user prompts and extract structured memories from transcripts. The extraction process involves:

1. Analyzing user prompts to understand intent and context
2. Processing condensed transcripts to identify key learnings
3. Generating memory objects with subject, keywords, and content

The system is designed to help future AI assistants understand the codebase by extracting actionable memories from session transcripts.
