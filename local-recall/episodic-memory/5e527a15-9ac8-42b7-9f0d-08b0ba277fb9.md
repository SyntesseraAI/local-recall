The embedding model (BGE-small-en-v1.5, ~133MB) is automatically downloaded to local_cache/ on first use. Uses cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0, rounded to 2 decimal places). Results sorted by score descending with recency tie-breaker. First startup takes 30-60 seconds for model download, then cached for subsequent runs.
