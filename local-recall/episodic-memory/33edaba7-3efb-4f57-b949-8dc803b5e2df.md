Memory extraction logic is separated into a dedicated prompts module (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) that contains the system prompt and extraction guidelines. This centralization makes it easy to update extraction criteria without modifying the extractor code. The prompts define what constitutes valuable memories and guide Claude in identifying key learnings from transcripts.
