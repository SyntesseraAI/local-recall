# Transcript Analysis for Memory Extraction

When extracting memories from Claude Code sessions:

1. **Full Session Context**: Analyze the entire condensed transcript from the current session, not just individual messages or tool calls

2. **What Gets Extracted**: Focus on valuable learnings and discoveries that will help future sessions:
   - Architectural decisions and their reasoning
   - Bug fixes and root cause analysis
   - Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
   - Configuration quirks or gotchas
   - Important relationships between components
   - User preferences discovered

3. **What NOT to Extract**:
   - Generic programming knowledge
   - Temporary debugging steps
   - Obvious or trivial information
   - Sensitive data
   - Information that becomes outdated quickly

4. **Scope Decisions**:
   - Use `global` for codebase-wide knowledge
   - Use `file:<path>` for file-specific information
   - Use `area:<name>` for component/area-specific knowledge

The extraction process receives the full condensed transcript with [LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL] markers to indicate this is the memory extraction phase.
