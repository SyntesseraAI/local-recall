The memory extraction system uses the Claude API (via Anthropic SDK) to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. Key implementation details:

- Located in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts`
- Uses `anthropic.messages.create()` for API calls
- Requires specific system and user prompts defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`
- Processes condensed transcripts (already formatted as events)
- Returns structured memory objects that are then persisted to disk
- Handles API errors and validates extracted memory structure
