The `applies_to` field determines memory scope:
- `global`: Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions)
- `file:<path>`: Specific to particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>`: Related to component/area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

This allows hooks to inject contextually relevant memories based on current file or area being worked on.
