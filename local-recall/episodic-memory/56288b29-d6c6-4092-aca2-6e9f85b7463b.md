Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools (via MCP) to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. All memories are stored locally within the repository, making them version-controllable and shareable among team members. The project uses:

- **Core Components**: MemoryManager (CRD operations), VectorStore (SQLite + embeddings), Search (semantic search), TranscriptCollector/Condenser/Extractor
- **Integration**: Claude Code hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit) and MCP server for memory access
- **Storage**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
- **Embeddings**: fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB, cached in `local_cache/`)
- **Vector Search**: better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for cosine distance similarity
