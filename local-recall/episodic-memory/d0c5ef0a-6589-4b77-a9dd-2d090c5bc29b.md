Search results from the vector store use cosine distance similarity scores ranging from 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (identical), rounded to 2 decimal places. When similarity scores are equal, memories are ranked by recency using the occurred_at field as a tie-breaker, with more recent memories ranked first. This ensures deterministic, predictable ranking of search results.
