The memory storage directory was renamed:

- Old: `local-recall/memories/`
- New: `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
- All references throughout the codebase were updated
- This improves clarity about the type of memory being stored
- Affects file paths in memory manager, index builder, and documentation
