The memory extraction prompt in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts provides Claude with condensed transcript events in a specific format using markers like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, and `[Tool: Name]`. The prompt instructs Claude to:

1. Analyze the transcript for valuable memories
2. Extract keywords that are specific, actionable, and relevant to the codebase
3. Return keywords as a JSON array
4. Follow guidelines about what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns) and what NOT to extract (generic knowledge, temporary steps, sensitive data)
