The MCP server runs a background daemon that periodically processes transcripts to extract memories. It syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/), processes them using the MemoryExtractor with Claude API calls, and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection. This allows the system to detect when transcripts have been modified and recreate memories accordingly.
