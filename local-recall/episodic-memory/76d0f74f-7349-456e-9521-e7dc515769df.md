The vector store is implemented in `src/core/vector-store.ts` using `better-sqlite3` with the `sqlite-vec` extension. It uses `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for generating embeddings. Search results use cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0, rounded to 2 decimals). When scores are equal, recency (occurred_at) acts as a tie-breaker. The database file `local-recall/memory.sqlite` is gitignored and auto-generated.
