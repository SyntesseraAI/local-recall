The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API to analyze session transcripts and automatically generate structured memories. The extractor calls Claude with a specialized prompt to extract meaningful insights from condensed transcripts, converting them into properly formatted memory objects with metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash).
