Local Recall embedding configuration:

- Model: BGE-small-en-v1.5 (~133MB)
- Auto-downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use
- First run takes 30-60 seconds for download (one-time only)
- Subsequent runs load from cache
- Common issue: If tokenizer error occurs ("Tokenizer file not found"), the cache is corrupted - remove `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to re-download

The model is cached locally to enable offline operation after initial setup.
