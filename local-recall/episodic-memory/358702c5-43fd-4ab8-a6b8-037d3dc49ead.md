The extraction system follows specific guidelines to maintain memory quality:

**DO Extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to this project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during session
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations applied

**DO NOT Extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

This ensures memories are actionable and relevant for future assistants.
