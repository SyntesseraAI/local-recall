# Session Transcript Analysis Process

When Claude Code sessions are analyzed for memory extraction, a special `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` marker is used to indicate that the system is in memory extraction mode.

## Key Points

- The marker appears at the start of transcript analysis
- It indicates that the transcript being analyzed is from the CURRENT session
- The system is analyzing what just happened to extract useful memories
- Memories should be extracted from the session events, not from external sources

## Transcript Format in Analysis

Transcripts are condensed into a structured format:
- `[User]` - What the user requested
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude responded
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of the tool
