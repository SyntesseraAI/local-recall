# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by underscores and leading underscores removed.

Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`

## Transcript Structure

Transcripts are stored in `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/transcripts/` as individual JSON files with timestamps in the filename.

This is important for the MCP server background daemon which reads transcripts from this location every 5 minutes to extract memories.
