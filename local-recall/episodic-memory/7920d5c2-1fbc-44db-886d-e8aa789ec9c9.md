# Hook Timing and Transcript Availability

## SessionStart Hook

- Runs at the beginning of a Claude Code session
- At this point, the transcript for the current session is NOT YET CREATED
- Only previous session transcripts are available
- Should load and inject recent memories from past sessions
- Cannot access current session's interactions yet

## Stop Hook

- Runs when the user stops/closes the Claude Code session
- At this point, the full transcript including all current session interactions IS AVAILABLE
- This is the appropriate time to extract memories from the transcript
- The MCP server currently handles this asynchronously every 5 minutes

## Implication

Memory extraction from transcripts can only happen AFTER a session ends (via Stop hook or MCP daemon), not during or at the start of a session. This is why the architecture uses a separate daemon process to handle transcript processing.
