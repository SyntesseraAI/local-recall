Transcripts are condensed into a structured event format for memory extraction:
- `[User]` - User queries and requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This condensed format is more token-efficient than raw transcripts and provides enough context for meaningful memory extraction.
