The memory manager has a `findDuplicate(occurredAt, contentHash)` function that detects existing duplicate memories. Deduplication uses:
- `occurred_at`: ISO-8601 timestamp of when event occurred (for sorting and grouping)
- `content_hash`: SHA-256 prefix (16 chars) of memory content

When creating a memory, it returns the existing memory if a duplicate is found rather than creating a new one (idempotent behavior).
