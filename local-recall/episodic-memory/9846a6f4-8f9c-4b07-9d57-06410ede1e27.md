# Transcript Condensing Pipeline

The Local Recall system includes a transcript condensing pipeline that converts detailed session transcripts into compact event-based format for memory extraction.

## Event Format

Condensed transcripts use this event format:
- `[User]` - User requests and questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

## Purpose

This condensed format:
1. Reduces token usage for memory extraction prompts
2. Focuses on meaningful interactions and decisions
3. Makes transcripts easier to analyze for memory creation
4. Removes verbose explanations while preserving essential information

## Implementation

The condensing logic is part of the memory extraction pipeline, converting raw Claude Code session transcripts into a structured event format suitable for processing by Claude Haiku during the memory extraction phase.
