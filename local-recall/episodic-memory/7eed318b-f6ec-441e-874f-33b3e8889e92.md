# BGE-small-en-v1.5 Embedding Model

## Model Details

- Uses `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model
- Download size: ~133MB
- Model is cached in `local_cache/` directory after first download

## Performance Characteristics

**First Run:**
- Initial startup takes 30-60 seconds while model downloads
- Only happens once

**Subsequent Runs:**
- Model loads from cache (`local_cache/`)
- Starts up much faster

## Troubleshooting

If you see: `Error: Tokenizer file not found at local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json`
- Cache is corrupted or incomplete (usually from interrupted download)
- Solution: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*`
- Model will re-download automatically on next run

## Purpose

Used for semantic search capabilities in the memory system to find contextually relevant memories beyond keyword matching.
