The codebase maintains clean separation between the extraction logic (src/core/memory-extractor.ts) and the extraction prompt (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts). This design pattern makes it easy to refine the extraction prompt without modifying the core logic, and allows version control of the prompt separately from the implementation.
