Three hooks integrate Local Recall with Claude Code (configured in `.claude/settings.json`): SessionStart hook loads 5 most recent memories on session start; UserPromptSubmit hook performs semantic search using vector embeddings when user submits a prompt; Stop hook is currently disabled - memory extraction is handled by the MCP server daemon running every 5 minutes, processing transcripts from Claude's cache asynchronously.
