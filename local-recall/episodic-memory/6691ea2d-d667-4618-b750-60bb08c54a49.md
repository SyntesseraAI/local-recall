The memory extraction pipeline processes transcripts by:

1. Parsing condensed transcript format with events like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, `[Result: OK/ERROR]`
2. Using Claude Haiku to analyze the transcript and identify valuable memories
3. Generating memory candidates with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content
4. Deduplicating memories based on content hash and occurred_at timestamp
5. Creating actual memory files in the episodic-memory directory

The extraction is intelligent enough to understand context from tool usage and results, allowing it to identify what was actually learned during the session.
