# Transcript Collector Refactoring Needed

The `transcript-collector.ts` file contains code that needs refactoring related to how it constructs and accesses Claude transcript file paths.

## Key Considerations

1. Transcripts are stored at `~/.claude/projects/[absolute-path]/transcripts/`
2. The path construction must handle the full absolute working directory path
3. Files are in `.jsonl` format
4. Need to ensure proper path resolution across different systems (though focus is on macOS)

## Current Status

File has been modified (M status in git), indicating active refactoring is underway.
