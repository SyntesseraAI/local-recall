The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku (the fast model) to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. The system implements transcript condensing to reduce token usage - condensing Tool invocations and Results into `[Tool: Name]` and `[Result: OK/ERROR]` format before sending to Claude. This keeps the context lean while preserving essential information about what was done during the session.
