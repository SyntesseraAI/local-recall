Vector store implements semantic search using cosine distance similarity:
- Score range: 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (identical)
- Scores rounded to 2 decimal places
- Results sorted by score descending
- **Recency tie-breaker**: When scores are equal, more recent memories (by occurred_at) rank first

Uses `better-sqlite3` with `sqlite-vec` extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings generated using `fastembed` with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model.
