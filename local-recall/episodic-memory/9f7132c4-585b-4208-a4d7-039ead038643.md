The transcript collection system should only process .jsonl files with valid UUID filenames. Previously it would filter for any .jsonl file, but this could lead to processing non-transcript files. Implemented a UUID regex pattern and validation function to ensure only proper transcript files (those that Claude Code generates with UUID names) are processed. This adds robustness to the transcript discovery and collection pipeline.
