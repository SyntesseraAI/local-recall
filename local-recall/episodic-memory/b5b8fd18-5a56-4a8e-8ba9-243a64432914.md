Each memory file stores metadata in YAML frontmatter including: `id` (UUID), `subject`, `keywords` (array), `applies_to` (scope), `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp), and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix). The `occurred_at` and `content_hash` fields are used for deduplication - preventing duplicate memories from being created when the same event is recorded multiple times.
