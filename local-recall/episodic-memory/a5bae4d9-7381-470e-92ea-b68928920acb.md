The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API (via `claude-sdk`) to analyze transcripts and extract structured memories. The system processes transcripts by sending them to Claude with a detailed extraction prompt that specifies the memory format with YAML frontmatter. The extraction prompt is defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and includes guidelines for what constitutes a valuable memory. The extractor handles batch processing of multiple transcripts efficiently.
