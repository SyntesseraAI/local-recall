# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name uses the absolute working directory with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes folder name `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format), one event per line. Each event contains:
- Message content and metadata
- Tool invocations and results
- Timestamps and session information

This is critical for the transcript collector component which syncs and processes these transcripts.
