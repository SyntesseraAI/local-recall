The memory extraction system is designed to work with transcripts from the transcript collector (src/core/transcript-collector.ts). The extractor processes condensed transcripts that contain events formatted as [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], and [Result: OK/ERROR] entries. This structured transcript format allows the memory extraction prompt to understand exactly what happened in a session and extract relevant learnings.
