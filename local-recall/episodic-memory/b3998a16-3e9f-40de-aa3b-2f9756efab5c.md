Claude stores project data in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project folders use URL-encoded paths (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`) and contain JSONL transcript files with UUIDs as filenames (e.g., `086dd5...jsonl`). This is important for understanding how Claude Code manages session history and transcripts across projects.
