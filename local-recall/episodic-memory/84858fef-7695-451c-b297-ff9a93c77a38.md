# Embedding Model Configuration

Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search capabilities.

## Model Details

- **Library**: fastembed
- **Model**: BGE-small-en-v1.5
- **Size**: ~133MB
- **Cache Location**: `local_cache/` directory

## Initialization Behavior

- Model is automatically downloaded on first use
- Download takes 30-60 seconds on initial startup
- Subsequent runs load from cache (fast)
- If cache becomes corrupted, remove `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and it will re-download

## Implementation Details

The embedding functionality is critical for semantic search across memories, allowing users to find relevant memories even with different wording.
