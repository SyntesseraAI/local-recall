Memory files are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` and are intentionally version-controlled (committed to git). Individual memory files are markdown with YAML frontmatter containing metadata like id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, and content_hash. The index file (`local-recall/index.json`) is gitignored and auto-generated for fast searching.
