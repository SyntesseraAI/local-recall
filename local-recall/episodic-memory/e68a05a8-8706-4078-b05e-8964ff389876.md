The memory extraction system in memory-extractor.ts uses Claude Haiku model to analyze transcripts and extract memories. It communicates with Claude via stdio using a subprocess approach with streaming enabled for efficient token usage and real-time processing. The extraction process sends condensed transcripts to Claude and receives back structured memory data.
