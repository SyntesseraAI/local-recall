The migration from sqlite-vec to Orama (pure JavaScript vector store) has successfully resolved mutex contention issues that were occurring in hooks. With Orama's pure JS implementation, there are no longer process isolation or mutex conflicts when multiple hooks execute concurrently. This eliminates the need for mutex handling and simplifies the hook architecture.
