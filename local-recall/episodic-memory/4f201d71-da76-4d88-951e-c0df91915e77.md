To improve efficiency and reduce token usage when extracting memories from transcripts, the system implements transcript condensing. This removes unnecessary details while preserving important context like:

- User requests and assistant responses
- Tool invocations and their results
- Code changes and decisions made

Condensing happens before sending transcripts to Claude Haiku for memory extraction, making the process faster and more cost-effective while maintaining memory quality.
