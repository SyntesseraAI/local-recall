Memory extraction from session transcripts should focus on extracting actionable knowledge that helps future assistants. Key principles:
- Be specific with file paths and function names
- Focus on architectural decisions, bug fixes, and code patterns
- Use appropriate scope: `global` for codebase-wide knowledge, `file:<path>` for file-specific, `area:<name>` for component areas
- Avoid generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and sensitive data
- Memories should help avoid mistakes or work more efficiently
