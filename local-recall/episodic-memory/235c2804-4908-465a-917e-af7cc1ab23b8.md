Claude Code stores project transcripts in ~/.claude/projects/ with encoded directory paths. The naming convention uses the full path encoded as a directory name (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`) followed by a UUID. Transcripts are stored in `transcripts/` subdirectory with the format `<date>-<time>-<uuid>.md`. This is important for the MCP daemon which syncs these transcripts to the memory system.
