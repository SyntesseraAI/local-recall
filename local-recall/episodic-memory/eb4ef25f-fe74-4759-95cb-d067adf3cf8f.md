The 'memories' folder was renamed to 'episodic-memory' throughout the codebase for clarity and consistency. This change affected:

- **Source code**: `src/core/memory.ts:34` and `src/core/index.ts:30` where `memoriesDir` path is defined
- **Tests**: `tests/unit/core/memory.test.ts:54` test expectations updated
- **Documentation**: CLAUDE.md, docs/mcp-server.md, and docs/architecture.md all updated

The 'memories' references in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts:53` (JSON schema for LLM response) were kept as-is since they refer to the response field name, not the folder.

All 266 tests pass after the refactoring.
