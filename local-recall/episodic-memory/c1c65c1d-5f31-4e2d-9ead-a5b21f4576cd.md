The project has a dedicated prompt file (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) that defines extraction guidelines for Claude. This prompt should specify:
- What constitutes valuable memories (architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, user preferences)
- What NOT to extract (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data)
- Required fields for memories (subject, keywords, applies_to, content)
- Scope guidelines (global vs file-specific vs area-specific)

This prompt is critical for consistent, high-quality memory extraction across all sessions.
