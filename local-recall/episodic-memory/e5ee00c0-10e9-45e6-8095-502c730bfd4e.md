The local-recall project requires a `.claude/settings.json` file in the project root to activate hooks. This file must be created locally (not checked into git typically) and contains hook command paths pointing to the built scripts in dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/. Without this file, even correctly coded hooks won't execute.
