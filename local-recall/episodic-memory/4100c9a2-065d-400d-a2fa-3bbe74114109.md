# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Naming Convention

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path. For the local-recall project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`, the transcript folder would be at:

`~/.claude/projects/Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

Path conversion rules:
- Forward slashes `/` are converted to underscores `_`
- The full absolute path components are included
- Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format)

## Usage in local-recall

The MCP server's background daemon syncs transcripts from this location every 5 minutes to extract memories. This is used in `src/utils/transcript.ts` for processing transcript data.
