# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The memory extraction pipeline includes a transcript condensing step that converts verbose JSONL transcripts into condensed event logs.

## Purpose

Condensing extracts the key events from Claude Code transcripts to make them suitable for memory extraction:
- Reduces noise and irrelevant details
- Extracts structured events (User questions, Assistant responses, Tool invocations)
- Prepares transcripts for keyword extraction and memory creation

## Event Types

Condensed transcripts capture:
- `[User]` - User prompts and questions
- `[Assistant]` - Assistant responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool invocations

## Integration

The condensing feature is part of the memory extraction process in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` and enables more efficient analysis of transcripts by the Claude Haiku model for memory creation.
