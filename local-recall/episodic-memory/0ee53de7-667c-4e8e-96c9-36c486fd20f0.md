# JSONL Transcript Parsing Requirements

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) format, where each line is a separate JSON object representing a transcript event.

## Key Points

- Each line in the file is a complete, independent JSON object
- Must parse line-by-line, not as a single JSON array
- Each event contains information about what happened in the transcript
- This is different from standard JSON parsing which would fail on JSONL

## Implementation Approach

When reading the transcript file:
1. Read the file as text
2. Split by newlines
3. Parse each non-empty line as JSON
4. Process events in order

This is more efficient for streaming and large transcripts than loading the entire file as JSON.
