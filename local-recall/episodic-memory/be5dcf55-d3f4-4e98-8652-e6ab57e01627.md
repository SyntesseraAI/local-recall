Index Manager maintains searchable keyword index of all memories:
- `buildIndex()` - Scans all memory files and builds keyword index
- `getIndex()` - Retrieves current index
- `refreshIndex()` - Rebuilds index from scratch

The index is stored at `local-recall/index.json` (gitignored) for fast access and is rebuilt on each session.
