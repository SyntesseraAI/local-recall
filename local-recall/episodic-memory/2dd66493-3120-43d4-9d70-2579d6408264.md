The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku (via `claude -p --model haiku`) to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. This is an efficient approach for processing session transcripts asynchronously in the MCP server background daemon. The extraction is designed to identify architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and user preferences from session events.
