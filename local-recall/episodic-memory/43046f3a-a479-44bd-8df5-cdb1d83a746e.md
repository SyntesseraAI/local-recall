When Local Recall performs internal operations (like extracting keywords from transcripts), these should not trigger additional memory extraction or hook recursion. Use the `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` token prefix to mark internal prompts, and ensure UserPromptSubmit and other hooks skip processing of prompts that begin with this token.
