The MCP server runs a background daemon that handles memory extraction asynchronously:

- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/)
- Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
- Runs every 5 minutes
- The Stop hook is disabled in favor of this daemon approach

This allows memory extraction to happen without blocking the user's session.
