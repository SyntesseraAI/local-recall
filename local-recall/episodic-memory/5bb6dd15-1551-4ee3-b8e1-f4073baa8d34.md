The memory extraction system analyzes Claude Code session transcripts in a condensed format with structured events:
- `[User]` - User questions/requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude responses/explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This format is used by `memory-extractor.ts` to parse transcripts and extract actionable memories.
