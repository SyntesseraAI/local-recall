The codebase uses sqlite-vec for vector operations. A known issue is 'mutex lock failed: Invalid argument' errors that occur when multiple processes attempt to load sqlite-vec concurrently. This is a cross-process synchronization problem that requires coordination mechanisms like file locking to prevent simultaneous access to the sqlite-vec library during initialization.
