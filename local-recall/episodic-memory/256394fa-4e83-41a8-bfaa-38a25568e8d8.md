# Transcript File Format

Claude Code transcript files use JSONL (JSON Lines) format:
- One JSON object per line
- Each line represents a single event or message in the session
- No array wrapper - just sequential JSON objects

## Parsing Implications

When reading transcript files:
1. Read the file line by line
2. Parse each line independently as JSON
3. Build up the transcript by processing events in order
4. Don't expect a top-level array

## Event Structure

Each line contains a structured event object. The exact schema depends on the event type (user message, assistant response, tool invocation, etc.).
