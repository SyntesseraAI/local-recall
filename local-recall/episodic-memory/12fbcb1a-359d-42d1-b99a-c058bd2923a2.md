The SessionStart hook loads the memory index and retrieves relevant memories based on the project context (cwd, file paths). These memories are injected into Claude's context BEFORE processing the user's first prompt. This allows Claude to have relevant project context from the start. The hook uses the `applies_to` scope field to filter memories relevant to the current working directory.
