The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku API with a structured prompt (from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) to parse session transcripts and extract valuable memories. The system passes the transcript content to Claude with a prompt that guides extraction of relevant insights, architectural decisions, and lessons learned from the session. This approach leverages Claude's language understanding to identify memorable information automatically rather than using heuristic-based extraction.
