# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Forward slashes `/` are replaced with underscores `_`
- Colons `:` are replaced with hyphens `-`
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`

## File Structure

- Transcripts are stored in `~/.claude/projects/<folder>/transcripts/`
- Each transcript is a `.jsonl` file (JSON Lines format)
- Filename format: `<session_id>.jsonl`
- Each line in the JSONL file is a JSON object representing a transcript event

## Transcript Events

Transcript events include:
- `type`: Event type (e.g., 'user_message', 'assistant_message', 'tool_use', 'tool_result')
- `content`: The event content
- `timestamp`: When the event occurred
- Additional fields depending on event type

This is essential for the transcript-collector to locate and process transcripts for memory extraction.
