# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

Each transcript is stored as a `.jsonl` file named with a timestamp format.

## Relevance

This is critical for the transcript-collector component which syncs and processes transcripts from Claude's cache to extract memories.
