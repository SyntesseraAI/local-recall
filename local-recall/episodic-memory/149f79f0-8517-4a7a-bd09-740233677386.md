# LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL Prompt Flow

## Discovery

The session contained a [LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL] marker that precedes special instructions for the Local Recall memory extraction system.

## Purpose

When a transcript contains [LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL] events, these represent internal directives to the memory extraction system, not actual user interactions or assistant responses.

## Examples in This Session

1. **Transcript Analysis Instruction** - The initial prompt provided instructions for extracting memories from a session transcript
2. **Keyword Extraction Request** - A request to extract keywords from text and return them as a JSON array

## Key Insight

These [LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL] prompts ARE the actual session activity. The task was for the AI assistant to extract keywords from the provided text and return them as JSON.

## Related Context

The session demonstrates the memory extraction system being used to analyze its own processes - the tool is being used to extract memories about how Local Recall works.
