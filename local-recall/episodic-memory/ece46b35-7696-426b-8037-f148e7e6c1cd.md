Thinking memories store Claude's internal reasoning (thinking block) paired with the corresponding text output. Format has Thought and Output sections. Extraction happens via daemon processing transcripts (20 parallel). Tool-only responses are skipped. These serve as concrete examples of reasoning patterns for similar future tasks.
