Local Recall integrates with Claude Code through three configured hooks in hooks.json: (1) SessionStart - loads 5 most recent memories on session start without vector store to avoid slow initialization, (2) UserPromptSubmit - uses vector store for semantic search on user prompts, (3) Stop - disabled, replaced by MCP server daemon. Hooks execute as shell commands receiving JSON via stdin and output memories to stdout for context injection.
