The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku to process session transcripts and extract valuable memories. The system reads transcripts, extracts keywords and summaries using Claude, and creates memory files with structured metadata including subject, keywords, applies_to scope, occurred_at timestamp, and content_hash for deduplication.
