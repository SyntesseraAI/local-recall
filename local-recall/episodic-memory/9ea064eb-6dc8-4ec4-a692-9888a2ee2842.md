The memory extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` provides detailed instructions to Claude Haiku about what constitutes valuable memories. It specifies:
- Memory format with subject, keywords, applies_to, and content fields
- Scope types: `global` (codebase-wide), `file:<path>` (file-specific), `area:<name>` (component-specific)
- What to extract: architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences
- What NOT to extract: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, sensitive data, outdated information
- Guidelines for being specific, concise, and actionable
