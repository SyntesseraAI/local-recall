Transcripts are parsed into events with the following structure (from `src/utils/transcript.ts`):
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

The `src/hooks/stop.ts` file processes these events to extract memories. When Stop hook works, it uses this event-based structure to identify important moments in the conversation.
