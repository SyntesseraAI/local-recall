The `syncTranscripts()` method:
1. Searches for transcripts in Claude's project directory
2. Copies found transcripts to the local-recall memory directory
3. Tracks which transcripts have been processed
4. Provides logging of how many were copied and processed

This enables the daemon to monitor for new transcripts and process them asynchronously every 5 minutes.
