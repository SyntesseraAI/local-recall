When testing the stop hook (src/hooks/stop.ts), the initial execution failed with exit code 1 due to a missing rake-pos dependency. The dependency is required by the stop hook for keyword extraction. This was resolved by running `npm install` to ensure all dependencies in package.json were properly installed. The rake-pos module provides RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction) and POS (Part-of-Speech) tagging functionality needed for memory keyword extraction.
