## Index Storage
Orama uses pure JavaScript vector storage with JSON-based index files:
- Files: `local-recall/orama-episodic-index.json` and `local-recall/orama-thinking-index.json`
- These are large JSON files containing the vector embeddings and index structure
- Stored as .json (not .dat or binary format)

## Index Rebuilding
When index files become corrupted or need to be reset:
1. Delete the JSON index files
2. System will automatically rebuild them from markdown memory files on next run
3. May be slow first time as embeddings are regenerated via Ollama

## Important for Debugging
- Check if index JSON files are valid (can be very large)
- Index files are gitignored and should not be committed
- Orama requires Ollama running for embedding generation during index rebuild
