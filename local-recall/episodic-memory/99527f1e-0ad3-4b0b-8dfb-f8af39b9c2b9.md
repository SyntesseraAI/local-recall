DO extract:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to this project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

DO NOT extract:
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that would become outdated quickly

These guidelines ensure memories are valuable, long-lasting, and actionable for future assistants.
