The memory extraction system has a bug where it processes its own internal `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` prefixed prompts as part of the transcript. This causes recursive processing where memory extraction requests are themselves treated as transcript events to extract memories from. The system needs to filter out `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` prefixed messages during transcript processing to prevent this loop.
