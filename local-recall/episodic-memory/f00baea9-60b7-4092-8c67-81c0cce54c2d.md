The gitignore content template is defined in at least two TypeScript files that generate the `.gitignore` for the `local-recall` folder:
- `src/core/index.ts` (line ~98+)
- `src/core/memory.ts` (around line 45-75)

When updating the template, **both files must be modified together** to keep them in sync. This is a maintenance burden and could be addressed by extracting the template to a shared utility or constant to avoid duplication.
