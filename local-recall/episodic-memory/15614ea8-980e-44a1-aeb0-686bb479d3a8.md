The memory extraction process in memory-extractor.ts uses Claude Haiku API with a carefully structured system prompt (stored separately in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) to extract memories from transcripts. The prompt guides Claude to identify architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and user preferences. The extraction returns memories as JSON with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content fields. This approach ensures consistent, high-quality memory extraction across all sessions.
