# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Directory Structure

Each project has its own directory under `~/.claude/projects/` containing:
- `transcripts/` - Directory with JSONL transcript files
- Each transcript file represents a Claude Code session

## File Format

Transcript files are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines format) where each line is a separate JSON object representing a message or event in the session.

## Relevance

This information is important for the `transcript-collector` component which needs to locate and process Claude Code session transcripts to extract memories. The MCP server daemon uses this path to sync transcripts from Claude's cache.

## Example Path

`~/.claude/projects/<project-name>/transcripts/`
