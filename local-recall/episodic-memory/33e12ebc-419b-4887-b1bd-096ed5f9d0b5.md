# Memory Extraction from Session Transcripts

The local-recall system automatically extracts memories from Claude Code session transcripts to build a persistent knowledge base. This process:

1. Uses [LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL] markers to identify sections requiring analysis
2. Condenses transcripts into structured events:
   - `[User]` - User requests or questions
   - `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses
   - `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, etc.)
   - `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool calls

3. Extracts valuable memories based on:
   - What was learned and discovered
   - Important facts about the codebase
   - Problems solved and their solutions
   - Code patterns and architectural decisions

## Memory Extraction Guidelines

- Be specific with file paths, function names, and concrete details
- Focus on actionable knowledge that helps future assistants
- Use appropriate scope (global, file-specific, or area-specific)
- Extract only lasting knowledge, not temporary debugging steps
- Avoid generic programming knowledge or sensitive data

## Output Format

Memories are returned as JSON with:
- `subject`: Brief one-line description
- `keywords`: 1-10 searchable keywords
- `applies_to`: Scope identifier
- `content`: Detailed markdown content
