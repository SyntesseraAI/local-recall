The memory-extractor.ts module uses Claude Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) with streaming enabled to extract memories from transcripts. The streaming approach allows processing large transcripts efficiently without waiting for full completion. The prompt is loaded from src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts.
