Local Recall requires Node.js 18+ and TypeScript 5.9+. Uses npm run build to compile TypeScript. Uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. Model downloads to local_cache/ on first use (30-60 seconds). Development requires comprehensive tests in tests/unit/ and tests/integration/, plus documentation in docs/ folder. All new features must have tests covering happy paths and edge cases.
