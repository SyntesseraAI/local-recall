The MCP server runs a background daemon that syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/), processes them using 'claude -p' to extract memories, tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection, and deletes/recreates memories when transcripts change. This runs every 5 minutes.
