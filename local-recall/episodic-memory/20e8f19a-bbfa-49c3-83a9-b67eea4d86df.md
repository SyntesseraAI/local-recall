When extracting memories from Claude Code transcripts:
- Extract specific, actionable knowledge (architecture decisions, bug fixes, code patterns)
- Avoid generic programming knowledge and temporary debugging steps
- Use appropriate scope: `global` for codebase-wide knowledge, `file:<path>` for file-specific, `area:<name>` for component-specific
- Include concrete details like file paths and function names
- Focus on what will help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently
