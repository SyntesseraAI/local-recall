Changed SessionStart hook to load the 5 most recent memories by reading files directly and sorting by occurred_at timestamp, rather than initializing the vector store. This avoids the overhead of loading the embedding model (133MB download + initialization) on every session start. The hook now completes in milliseconds instead of timing out.
