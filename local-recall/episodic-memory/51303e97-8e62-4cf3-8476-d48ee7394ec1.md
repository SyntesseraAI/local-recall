Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system that allows Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions. Memories are stored as structured markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory with YAML frontmatter containing metadata like id, subject, keywords, scope, and content hash.
