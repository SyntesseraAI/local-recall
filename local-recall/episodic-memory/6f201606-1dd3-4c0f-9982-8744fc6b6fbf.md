# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes encoded as underscores and special characters URL-encoded (e.g., colons become `%3A`).

For example:
- Path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder: `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files within the project folder:
- Each line is a JSON event object
- Events contain user messages, assistant responses, and tool usage
- Used by Local Recall's transcript collector to extract memories

## Access Pattern

When building tools that need to process transcripts:
1. Construct the path-encoded folder name from the working directory
2. Look in `~/.claude/projects/{encoded-path}/`
3. Parse JSONL files to extract transcript events
