# Session Transcript Analysis Format

When analyzing Claude Code session transcripts for memory extraction, the system uses:

## Marker System
- `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` markers identify sections requiring analysis

## Condensed Event Format
Transcripts are condensed into events:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool calls

## Purpose
This structured format helps identify:
- What was learned
- Problems solved
- Codebase-specific knowledge that should be preserved as memories

The condensed format keeps transcripts focused and machine-readable while removing verbose interaction details.
