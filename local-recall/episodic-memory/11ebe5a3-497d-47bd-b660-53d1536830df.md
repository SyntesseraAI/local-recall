User preference: Cannot use a single shared daemon for search because each Claude instance needs its own MCP server. Using an HTTP daemon architecture within the MCP server would mean multiple ONNX instances loading concurrently anyway, recreating the mutex problem.

Architectural constraint: Multiple running Claude instances cannot share a single daemon port or background process. Each instance requires isolated MCP server configuration.
