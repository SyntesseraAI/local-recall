The `MemoryExtractor` class in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` manages the extraction workflow:

1. **extractMemoriesFromTranscript(transcriptPath)** - Main entry point that reads a transcript file and processes it through Claude Haiku
2. **Deduplication** - Uses `occurredAt` timestamp and content hash to detect and skip duplicate memories
3. **Error Handling** - Gracefully handles missing or invalid transcripts
4. **Memory Creation** - Uses the MemoryManager to persist extracted memories with proper YAML frontmatter
5. **Logging** - Integrates with the logger utility for debugging and monitoring

The class validates that extracted memories have required fields before creating them.
