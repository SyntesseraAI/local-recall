The memory extractor module uses Claude Haiku (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) to extract keywords from transcripts. It sends the transcript to Claude with a structured prompt that returns JSON with keyword arrays. The extractor handles the response parsing and uses these keywords for memory indexing and search functionality.
