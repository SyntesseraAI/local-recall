Memory files are stored as structured markdown files in local-recall/episodic-memory/ directory and are committed to git. The SQLite database (memory.sqlite) and debug log (recall.log) are gitignored and auto-generated. Each memory file has a unique UUID as filename and contains YAML frontmatter followed by markdown content.
