# User Preferences Discovered

## Memory Extraction
- User wants memories extracted from session transcripts to improve future assistant work
- Memories should be specific, actionable, and tied to the codebase context

## Response Handling in Hooks
- The `user-prompt-submit` hook should log responses to `recall.log` for debugging
- Responses should use single quotes consistently in logging output
- The hook processes Claude's responses and logs them for transparency

## Logging Preferences
- The user prefers detailed logging to the `recall.log` file
- Log entries should be human-readable and timestamped
- Hook output should be traceable for debugging purposes
