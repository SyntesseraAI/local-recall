The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. The extractor runs asynchronously via the MCP server daemon (every 5 minutes) rather than during the Stop hook. This allows for more thorough analysis without blocking the user session. The system tracks processed transcripts by content hash to avoid reprocessing unchanged transcripts.
