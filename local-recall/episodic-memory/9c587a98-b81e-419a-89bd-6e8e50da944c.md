The memory extraction process analyzes condensed Claude Code session transcripts. The transcript format uses standardized events:

- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude responses or explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool invocation outcomes

This structured format makes it easier to identify what was learned, problems solved, and patterns discovered during the session.
