# Claude Project Transcripts Storage

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Project Folder Naming

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path using a specific conversion:
- Forward slashes `/` are replaced with underscores `_`
- The leading slash is removed
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory:
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/{converted_path}/transcripts/`
- Files are named with timestamps: `{timestamp}.jsonl`
- Each line in a JSONL file is a separate JSON object representing a transcript event

## File Format

Transcript events include fields like:
- `type`: Event type (e.g., 'user_message', 'assistant_message', 'tool_call')
- `timestamp`: ISO-8601 timestamp
- `content`: The actual message or tool invocation data
- Additional metadata depending on event type
