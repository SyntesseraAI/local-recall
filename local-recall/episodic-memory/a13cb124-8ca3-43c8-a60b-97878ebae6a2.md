The system prompt for memory extraction is defined in a separate file (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) that guides Claude Haiku on how to analyze transcripts and generate appropriate memories. This separation allows for easy maintenance and updates to the extraction logic without modifying the core extractor code.
