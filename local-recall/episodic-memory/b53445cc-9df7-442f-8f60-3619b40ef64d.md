# Extracting User Prompts from Transcripts

When analyzing Claude Code transcripts to create memories, user prompts need to be extracted from the transcript events.

## Key Insight

The transcript events contain structured data about user interactions. To identify which events represent user prompts, look for events with type indicators that distinguish user messages from assistant responses and tool calls.

This allows the memory extraction system to:
1. Identify user-initiated actions
2. Extract the actual user prompt text
3. Understand the context of requests
4. Create memories tied to specific user intents
