# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full transcripts path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (JSON Lines format) with format: `transcript-{timestamp}.jsonl`

Each line in the file is a separate JSON object representing a transcript event.

## Key Implementation Notes

- This path normalization is critical for the transcript collector to locate transcripts
- The location is consistent across macOS systems at `~/.claude/projects/`
- Transcripts must be parsed as JSONL (line-delimited JSON) not single JSON objects
- This is used by the transcript-collector.ts to sync transcripts from Claude's cache
