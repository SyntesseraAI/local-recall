Claude stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` with URL-encoded directory names. The naming convention uses the full path with hyphens replacing slashes. Example: `/Users/joe/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`. Each transcript file is named with a timestamp and `.md` extension.
