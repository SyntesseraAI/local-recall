When extracting thinking memories from transcripts:
- Save ALL thinking blocks, even if single-line
- Only save ANSWERS if they span multiple lines
- Subject extraction: for multi-line text take first line, for single-line take up to first period or all text if no period present

This was updated in src/core/types.ts and src/utils/transcript.ts to support separate thinking field and filtering logic.
