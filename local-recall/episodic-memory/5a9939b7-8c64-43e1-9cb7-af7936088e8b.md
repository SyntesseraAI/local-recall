# User Workspace Organization

The user's projects are organized under `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/`:
- Parent directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/`
- Project: `local-recall` (memory system for AI assistants)

This suggests a preference for organizing related projects under a common parent directory (Syntessera). Future features or integrations might reference other projects in this workspace.
