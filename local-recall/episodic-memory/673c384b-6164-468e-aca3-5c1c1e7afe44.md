Before extracting memories from a transcript, the transcript is first condensed to reduce token usage. This condensing step is essential for efficient processing, especially for longer transcripts. The condensed transcript is then passed to Claude Haiku for memory extraction via the system prompt defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`.
