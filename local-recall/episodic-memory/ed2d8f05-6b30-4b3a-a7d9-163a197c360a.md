The `memory-extractor.ts` module is responsible for processing transcripts and extracting memories. It includes logic for:
- Condensing transcripts to extract key information
- Creating memories from extracted information
- Validating memory content before storage

This is a core component for the memory system pipeline, used by the MCP server daemon to process transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes.
