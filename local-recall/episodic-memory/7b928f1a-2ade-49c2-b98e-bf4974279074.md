Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for Claude Code and other AI tools via MCP. It stores memories as YAML-frontmatter markdown files in local-recall/episodic-memory/ directory. The system includes:

- **Hooks**: SessionStart (loads index), UserPromptSubmit (searches memories), Stop (disabled)
- **MCP Server**: Exposes memory tools (create, delete, search, list, rebuild index)
- **Memory Format**: YAML frontmatter with id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash fields
- **Index**: Auto-generated index.json (gitignored) for fast keyword lookup
- **Embedding Model**: Uses BGE-small-en-v1.5 (~133MB) for semantic search, cached in local_cache/

Project root IS the plugin root following Claude Code's plugin format.
