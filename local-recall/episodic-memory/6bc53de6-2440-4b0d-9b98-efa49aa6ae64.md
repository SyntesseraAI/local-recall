Memories should be specific (include file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes). Extract architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, and component relationships. Do NOT extract generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, or obvious information. Use appropriate scope: `global` for codebase-wide patterns, `file:<path>` for specific files, `area:<name>` for components.
