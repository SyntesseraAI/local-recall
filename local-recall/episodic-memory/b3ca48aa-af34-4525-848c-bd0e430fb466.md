Local Recall integrates with Claude Code via three hooks configured in `hooks.json`: (1) SessionStart - loads 5 most recent memories on session start without using vector store; (2) UserPromptSubmit - performs semantic search using vector embeddings when user submits prompt; (3) Stop hook is currently disabled. Memory extraction is handled by MCP server daemon processing transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes instead.
