# Memory Extraction Guidelines

When extracting memories from transcripts:

## DO Extract
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to this project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations and optimizations

## DO NOT Extract
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps with no long-term value
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, PII)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Best Practices
- Be specific with file paths and function names
- Be concise: one concept per memory
- Make memories actionable - help future assistants avoid mistakes
- Use appropriate scope (global vs file-specific vs area-specific)
- Include concrete examples when helpful

These guidelines ensure memories are valuable and don't pollute the memory store with noise.
