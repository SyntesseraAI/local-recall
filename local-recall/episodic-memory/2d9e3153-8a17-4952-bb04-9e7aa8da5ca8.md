# Transcript Condensing

The MCP server implements transcript condensing as part of the memory extraction workflow. This feature summarizes long transcripts into a condensed format before processing them with Claude for memory extraction.

## Purpose

Condensing transcripts reduces token usage when sending them to Claude's API for analysis, making the memory extraction process more efficient and cost-effective.

## Process

1. Read full JSONL transcript
2. Condense to key events (User messages, Assistant responses, Tool invocations, Results)
3. Send condensed transcript to Claude for memory extraction
4. Claude analyzes the condensed transcript and returns extracted memories

## Implementation

The condensing logic likely filters out verbose details while preserving the essential information flow of the session. This helps Claude focus on actionable insights rather than implementation details.
