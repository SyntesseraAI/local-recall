Transcripts are processed in a condensed format that uses consistent event markers to represent different types of interactions:

- `[User]` - What the user asked or requested
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude said or explained
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This structured format makes it easier to parse and understand the flow of a session without storing massive amounts of raw transcript data. Memory extraction systems should parse using these markers.
