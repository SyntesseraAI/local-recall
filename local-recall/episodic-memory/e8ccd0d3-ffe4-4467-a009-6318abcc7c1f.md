The `memory-extractor.ts` module is responsible for:
- Reading and parsing session transcripts
- Sending transcript content to Claude Haiku for analysis
- Processing the AI response to extract structured memories
- Creating memory files using the memory manager
- Handling deduplication to avoid creating duplicate memories

This is a core component of the background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously.
