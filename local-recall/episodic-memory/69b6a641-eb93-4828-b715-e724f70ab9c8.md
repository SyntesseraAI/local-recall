# User Preference: TodoWrite for Task Planning

The user has established a clear preference for using the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout conversations:

1. **Proactive Use**: TodoWrite should be used very frequently to ensure tasks are tracked and user progress is visible
2. **Task Marking**: Mark todos as completed immediately after finishing (not batching multiple tasks)
3. **In-Progress Limit**: Keep exactly ONE task marked as in_progress at a time
4. **Planning First**: For complex tasks, use TodoWrite to plan before implementation
5. **Visibility**: Helps user understand the progress of current tasks and overall progress

This is documented in the instructions and should be followed in all future sessions.
