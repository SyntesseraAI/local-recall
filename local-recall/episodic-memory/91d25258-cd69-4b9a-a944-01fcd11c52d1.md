The project has comprehensive test coverage with 266 tests that pass successfully. Tests are organized in:
- `tests/unit/core/` - Core memory management functionality
- `tests/integration/` - End-to-end memory lifecycle
- `tests/unit/prompts/` - LLM prompt validation

All tests pass after the episodic-memory rename and transcript sync changes.
