# User Preference for Direct Tool Usage

The user prefers that Claude uses tools (Grep, Read, Glob, Edit, etc.) directly when the task is straightforward, rather than spawning agents via the Task tool.

## Context

When the user asked "Extract keywords from this text", the assistant attempted to spawn an agent, but the user pushed back, indicating they prefer direct tool usage for simple, focused tasks.

## Implication

For future sessions working with this codebase:
- Use agents (Task tool) only when genuinely needed for complex exploration or multi-step tasks
- For straightforward queries, searches, and edits, use direct tools
- This reduces context overhead and keeps interactions more direct
