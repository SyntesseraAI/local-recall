The processed logs (`episodic-processed-log.jsonl` and `thinking-processed-log.jsonl`) are JSONL files that track which transcripts have been processed:

- Format: One JSON object per line (newline-delimited JSON)
- Each entry has: `transcript_path`, `content_hash`, `processed_at`
- Used to detect if transcript has changed (content_hash differs)
- If content changes, old memories are deleted and new ones created

With concurrent writes, these files can lose entries or have partial writes. The daemon needs file-level locking to coordinate writes safely.
