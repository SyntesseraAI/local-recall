The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API with streaming enabled to process transcripts efficiently. The `extractMemories()` function calls the Claude API with `stream: true` to handle token-intensive operations. This streaming approach allows the system to process large transcripts without exceeding token limits and provides real-time feedback during extraction.
