Important for understanding memory persistence:
- Memory files (*.md) in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` and `local-recall/thinking-memory/` ARE version-controlled
- `local-recall/memory.sqlite` is gitignored and auto-generated from memory files
- `local-recall/recall.log` is gitignored debug log
- `.local-recall/.gitignore` is auto-generated to exclude memory.sqlite and recall.log

This means memories are shared across the team while the generated indices are local.
