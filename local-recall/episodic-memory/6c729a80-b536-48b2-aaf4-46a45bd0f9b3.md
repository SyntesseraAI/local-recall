The CLAUDE.md documentation had several inconsistencies with the actual codebase:

1. **Architecture tree** - Referenced `scripts/` folder for build output, but actual build outputs to `dist/`
2. **Plugin structure** - Documented non-existent folders (`.claude-plugin/`, `hooks.json`, `.mcp.json`)
3. **Missing src files** - Documentation was incomplete, missing files like `transcript-collector.ts`, `transcript-condenser.ts`, `memory-extractor.ts`, `processed-log.ts`, `prompts/`, `types/` folders
4. **All path references** - Had to be updated from `scripts/` to `dist/` throughout

This was fixed by reviewing actual source structure and updating all documentation to match the real codebase layout.
