The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API with structured output mode to extract memories from transcripts. It sends transcript content and a system prompt to Claude, which returns structured memories with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content fields. The extraction process is asynchronous and handles API calls to claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 model.
