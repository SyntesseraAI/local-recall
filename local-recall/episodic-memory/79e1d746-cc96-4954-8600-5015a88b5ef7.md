# Claude Project Transcript Storage

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Naming Convention

The project folder name uses the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files in these project folders
- This allows Claude to organize transcripts by project location

## Practical Implications

- When debugging transcript collection, look at `~/.claude/projects/` directory
- Project identification is based on the absolute working directory path
- Multiple projects with same name but different paths have separate transcript collections
