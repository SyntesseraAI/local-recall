The Stop hook is currently disabled. Memory extraction is handled by the MCP server daemon which processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. The daemon syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/), uses `claude -p` to extract memories, and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection. Memories are deleted and recreated when transcripts change.
