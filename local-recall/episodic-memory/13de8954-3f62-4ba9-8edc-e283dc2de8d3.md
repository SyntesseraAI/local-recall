Memory extraction prompts are centralized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` rather than being embedded in the extractor code. This follows the project's pattern of separating concerns and makes it easier to refine extraction criteria without modifying core logic. The prompts define what should and should not be extracted from transcripts.
