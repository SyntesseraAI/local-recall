The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku (via MCP) to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. The transcript is first condensed into a structured format with events like [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], and [Result: OK/ERROR] before being sent to Haiku for analysis. This condensing step reduces token usage while preserving essential context about what happened during the session.
