Memory files are stored in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. Individual memories are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter containing metadata like id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, and content_hash. The index file (local-recall/index.json) and log file (local-recall/recall.log) are gitignored.
