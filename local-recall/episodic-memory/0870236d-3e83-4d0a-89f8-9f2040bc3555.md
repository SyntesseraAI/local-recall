Transcript condensing is implemented to optimize token usage when passing transcripts to Claude for memory extraction. The process converts verbose session transcripts into a compact event format with:
- `[User]` events for user requests
- `[Assistant]` events for Claude's responses
- `[Tool: Name]` events for tool invocations
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` events for outcomes

This reduces token count significantly while preserving essential context needed for memory extraction.
