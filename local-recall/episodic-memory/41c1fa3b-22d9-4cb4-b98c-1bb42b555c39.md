The hooks for local-recall are configured in `local-recall-plugin/config/hooks.json`, NOT in `.claude/settings.json` at the project root. This is because hooks are part of the plugin distribution system. When distributing local-recall as a plugin package, the hooks configuration must be in the plugin's config directory. Users installing via npm should reference the hooks from the installed package, not configure them manually in their project settings.
