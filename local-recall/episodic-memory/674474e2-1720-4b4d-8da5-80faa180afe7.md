The MCP server daemon needs to discover where Claude stores its transcripts in order to sync and process them for memory extraction. Currently, the project assumes transcripts are in a known location, but this requires either:

1. Configuration of the Claude projects directory path
2. Runtime discovery of the Claude projects directory
3. Integration with Claude's MCP to get transcript paths

Without proper transcript discovery, the memory extraction feature cannot function effectively across different user setups.
