Transcripts are condensed into structured events for memory extraction:

- `[User]` - What the user asked or requested
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude said or explained  
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This format makes it easier for Haiku to analyze key events and extract relevant memories without processing entire verbose transcripts.
