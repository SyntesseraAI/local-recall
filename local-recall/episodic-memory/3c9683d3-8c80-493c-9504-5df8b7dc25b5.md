Hook scripts reference their paths using ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} variable in hooks.json to ensure portability across different installation paths. This allows the plugin to be installed anywhere and still locate its bundled scripts. The cwd is passed via stdin to hooks so they can operate on the user's project directory.
