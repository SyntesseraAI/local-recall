The memory extraction prompt (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) provides detailed instructions for Claude to extract memories from transcripts. The prompt emphasizes proper scoping (global vs file-specific vs area-specific), keyword selection, and formatting. It defines what should and shouldn't be extracted to ensure high-quality memories that are actionable and specific to the codebase.
