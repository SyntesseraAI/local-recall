Local Recall uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for embeddings. Model is automatically downloaded to local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/ on first use (takes 30-60 seconds). If 'Tokenizer file not found' error occurs, the cache is corrupted - remove local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5* and the model will re-download automatically.
