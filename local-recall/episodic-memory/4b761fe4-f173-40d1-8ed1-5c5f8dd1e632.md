# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

## Purpose

Transcripts are condensed before being passed to memory extraction to:
- Reduce token usage when extracting memories from long sessions
- Remove intermediate debugging and exploration steps
- Focus on the final, meaningful outcomes
- Make transcripts more useful for future AI assistants

## Process

1. Parse the full JSONL transcript
2. Identify meaningful events (tool invocations and results)
3. Summarize intermediate steps into concise descriptions
4. Keep final outcomes and important discoveries
5. Remove redundant or debugging-only steps

## Why It Matters

Full transcripts can be very long and contain many exploration steps that aren't useful for future work. Condensing preserves the important decisions and learnings while reducing noise.

## Implementation Location

See `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` for the transcript condensing implementation.
