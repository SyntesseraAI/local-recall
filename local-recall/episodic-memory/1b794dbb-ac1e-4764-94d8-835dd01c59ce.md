Claude Code stores project data in `~/.claude/projects/` using a naming convention where the project's absolute path has all `/` characters replaced with `-`.

For example:
- Project path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Claude folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

Transcripts are stored in `transcripts/` subdirectory within this folder. This naming convention is critical for the transcript-collector to locate and sync session transcripts.
