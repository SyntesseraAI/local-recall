Local Recall uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB). The model is automatically downloaded on first run to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`. First startup takes 30-60 seconds, subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file is not found, clear the cache with `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and it will re-download automatically.
