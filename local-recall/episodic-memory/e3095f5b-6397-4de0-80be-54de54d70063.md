# Embedding Model Configuration

Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search.

## Model Details
- **Library**: fastembed
- **Model**: BGE-small-en-v1.5
- **Size**: ~133MB
- **Cache Location**: `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`

## Caching and Performance
- The embedding model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use
- Subsequent runs load the model from cache
- **First run**: May take 30-60 seconds while the model downloads (normal)
- **Troubleshooting**: If you see "Tokenizer file not found" error, the cache may be corrupted - delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and the model will re-download automatically

## Vector Store Integration
Embeddings are used in the vector store (`src/core/vector-store.ts`) with better-sqlite3 and sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search. Cosine distance is used for scoring (0.0 = no match, 1.0 = identical), with results sorted by score descending and recent memories ranked first on ties.
