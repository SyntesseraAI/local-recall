BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) automatically downloads to local_cache/ on first use. First startup takes 30-60 seconds while downloading. Subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file missing error occurs (corrupted cache), remove local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5* directory to force re-download.
