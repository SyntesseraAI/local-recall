The memory extraction system prevents duplicates by using two mechanisms: the `occurred_at` timestamp (when the original event happened) and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix of the memory content). The MemoryManager.findDuplicate() function checks for existing memories with the same timestamp and content hash before creating new ones, making memories idempotent.
