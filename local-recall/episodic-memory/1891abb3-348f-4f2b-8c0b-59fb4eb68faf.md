Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows AI agents to store and retrieve contextual information across sessions. It uses structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter stored in version-controlled episodic-memory directory. The system includes:

- **Claude Code Plugin**: Hooks for SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, and Stop events
- **MCP Server**: Exposes memory tools for any MCP-compatible client
- **Vector Store**: SQLite-backed semantic search using fastembed (BGE-small-en-v1.5 model)
- **Memory Format**: Markdown files with metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash)

Memory files are version-controlled and can be scoped to `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`.
