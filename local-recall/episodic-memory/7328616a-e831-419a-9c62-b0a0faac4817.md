# Code Style Preference: Explicit Conditionals

The user has indicated a preference for using explicit `if-else` statements over ternary operators in the codebase.

## Rationale

- More readable, especially for complex logic
- Easier to debug and add breakpoints
- Clearer intent in code reviews
- Better aligned with the project's existing code patterns

## Application

When writing or refactoring code in this project:
- Prefer `if (condition) { ... } else { ... }` over ternary operators
- This applies to assignments, returns, and control flow
- Use ternary only for simple, single-line conditional expressions where readability isn't compromised
