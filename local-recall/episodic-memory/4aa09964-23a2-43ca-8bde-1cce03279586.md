# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The local-recall project implements transcript condensing as a preprocessing step for memory extraction in the MCP server.

## Purpose

Condensing transcripts serves to:
1. Reduce token usage when sending transcripts to Claude for memory extraction
2. Preserve essential information while removing verbose or redundant content
3. Make transcripts more suitable for analysis by focusing on key events

## Implementation Location

The transcript condensing logic is implemented in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`.

## Process

The transcript condensing converts detailed transcript events into a more concise format:
- User requests are condensed to `[User] - <content>`
- Assistant responses are condensed to `[Assistant] - <content>`
- Tool invocations are condensed to `[Tool: Name]` format
- Tool results are condensed to `[Result: OK/ERROR]` format

This condensed format is then sent to Claude for memory extraction analysis.
