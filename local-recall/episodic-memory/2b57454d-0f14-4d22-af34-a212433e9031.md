The Claude CLI response parser handles responses from `claude -p` that may come in different formats. The parser normalizes field names (e.g., `keywords_array` → `keywords`, `subject_line` → `subject`) to ensure consistency. This handles variations in how the Claude tool formats its JSON output across different versions or invocations.
