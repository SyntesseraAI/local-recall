Total of 228 unit tests pass after implementing field name normalization in memory-extractor.ts. Added comprehensive test coverage including:
- normalizeMemoryFields() helper testing all field name variations
- Tests for common alternative field names: description, tags, scope, text
- Tests for partial field mappings and missing fields
- All existing tests continue to pass

Run with: npm run test:unit -- --run
