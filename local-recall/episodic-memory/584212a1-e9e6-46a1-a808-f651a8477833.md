# Memory Keyword Selection Strategy

## User Preference

The user has emphasized the importance of selecting **specific, targeted keywords** when creating memories to improve search relevance and reduce false positives in fuzzy matching.

## Best Practices for Keywords

1. **Be specific**: Use concrete, technical terms rather than vague categories
   - Good: `transcript-collector`, `jsonl`, `url-encoded-paths`
   - Bad: `code`, `files`, `stuff`

2. **Include context**: Keywords should help identify when a memory is relevant
   - Include file paths (e.g., `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`)
   - Include component names (e.g., `transcript-collection`)
   - Include technical concepts (e.g., `fuzzy-matching`)

3. **Avoid redundancy**: Don't include multiple variations of the same concept

4. **Think about search**: What would someone search for if they needed this memory?

## Impact

Well-chosen keywords significantly improve the effectiveness of the fuzzy search system, making memories more discoverable when they're actually needed.
