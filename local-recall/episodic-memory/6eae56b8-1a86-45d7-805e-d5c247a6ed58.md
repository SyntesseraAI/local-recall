The memory extraction prompt in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts defines a structured JSON output format that Claude Haiku must follow when extracting memories. The prompt specifies the exact fields required (subject, keywords, applies_to, content) and provides guidelines for what should and should not be extracted as memories. This ensures consistent, parseable output from the memory extraction process.
