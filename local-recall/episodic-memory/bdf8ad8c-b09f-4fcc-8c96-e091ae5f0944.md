Project organization: `src/core/` contains memory.ts, vector-store.ts, embedding.ts, search.ts, transcript-collector.ts, and memory-extractor.ts; `src/hooks/` has SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, and Stop hooks; `src/mcp-server/` has the MCP server implementation; `src/utils/` contains helpers for markdown, transcripts, logging, fuzzy matching, config, and gitignore management. Compiled output goes to `dist/` (gitignored).
