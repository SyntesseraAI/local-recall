Before extracting memories from transcripts, transcripts should be condensed to reduce token usage and focus on essential information. This preprocessing step:

1. Removes verbose chat exchanges
2. Keeps important decisions and discoveries
3. Preserves error messages and solutions
4. Summarizes repetitive debugging steps
5. Maintains chronological order of events

This allows the memory extractor to process full session transcripts efficiently without exceeding token limits or getting lost in low-value conversation details.
