The extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` provides Claude with detailed guidelines:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations or optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

Memories must use appropriate scope (global, file:<path>, area:<name>) and be specific, concise, and actionable. Each memory focuses on one concept.
