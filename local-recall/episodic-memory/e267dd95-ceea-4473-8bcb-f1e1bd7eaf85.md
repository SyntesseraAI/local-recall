User confirmed that the Local Recall system is working exactly as designed:
- All three hooks are firing and functioning correctly
- SessionStart loads memories, UserPromptSubmit searches them, Stop creates new ones
- The log files clearly show this cycle in action
- No additional fixes or features are needed at this time
