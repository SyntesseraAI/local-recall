The memory extraction process includes transcript condensing that transforms full transcripts into a structured event format. Instead of storing complete conversation logs, the system creates condensed versions that highlight:
- `[User]` events - user requests and questions
- `[Assistant]` events - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` events - tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` events - outcomes of tool calls

This condensed format makes transcripts more suitable for memory extraction by focusing on actionable events rather than verbose conversations.
