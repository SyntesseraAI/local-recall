Local Recall is a project that creates a persistent memory layer allowing AI agents (Claude Code and other MCP clients) to store and retrieve contextual information about codebases across sessions. All memories are stored as version-controlled markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings (fastembed + BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic search capabilities.
