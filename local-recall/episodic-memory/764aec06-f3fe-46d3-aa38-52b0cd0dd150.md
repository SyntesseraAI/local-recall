The new JSONL format provides several advantages over individual markdown files:

1. **Append-only writes** - New memories are appended to JSONL files, eliminating directory traversal overhead
2. **Embedded embeddings** - Vector embeddings are stored directly in each entry, reducing separate index file lookups
3. **Efficient operations** - "add" and "delete" operations create clear operation history
4. **Atomic file operations** - Each JSONL line is independently parseable
5. **Version control friendly** - JSONL format is easier to diff and merge than directory structures
6. **Single file per type** - Two files (episodic, thinking) are simpler to manage than dozens of individual markdown files
