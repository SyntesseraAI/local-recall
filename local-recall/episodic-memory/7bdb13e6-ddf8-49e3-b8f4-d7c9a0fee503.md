Claude Code stores project data in `~/.claude/projects/` with directory names that are URL-encoded versions of the project path. Session transcripts are stored in `transcripts/` subdirectory within each project folder. The path encoding converts slashes and special characters to URL-safe formats, allowing Claude to track multiple projects.
