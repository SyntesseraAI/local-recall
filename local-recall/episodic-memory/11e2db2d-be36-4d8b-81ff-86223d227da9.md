The stop hook in `src/hooks/stop.ts` is currently not being used. According to CLAUDE.md, the Stop hook is disabled and memory extraction is instead handled by the MCP server daemon which processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. The daemon syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, extracts memories using claude -p, and tracks processed transcripts.
