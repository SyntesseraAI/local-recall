The memory-extractor.ts module contains logic to detect and process the `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` marker in user prompts. When this marker is present, the system automatically analyzes the current session transcript to extract valuable memories for future reference. This allows the system to continuously learn from interactions and improve context for subsequent sessions.
