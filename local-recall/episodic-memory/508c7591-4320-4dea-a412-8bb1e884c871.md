Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that enables Claude Code and other AI tools (via MCP) to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. All memories are stored locally within the repository, making them version-controllable and shareable among team members. The system consists of:

- Memory storage in markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- SQLite vector store for semantic search using fastembed embeddings
- Claude Code hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit)
- MCP server for exposing memory tools to compatible clients

Memories are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory and are tracked in git.
