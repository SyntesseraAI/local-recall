The system includes transcript condensing functionality that transforms raw Claude Code session transcripts into condensed event-based format with entries like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, and `[Tool: Name]`. This condensed format is more suitable for memory extraction as it reduces token usage while preserving essential information about what was discussed and accomplished.
