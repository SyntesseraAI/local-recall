# Memory Extraction Guidelines

When extracting memories from transcripts:

## What to Extract

- **Architectural decisions** and their reasoning
- **Bug fixes** and root cause analysis
- **Code patterns** or conventions specific to this project
- **Configuration quirks** or gotchas
- **User preferences** discovered during sessions
- **Important relationships** between components
- **Performance considerations** or optimizations
- **File paths and specific functions** involved in solutions

## What NOT to Extract

- Generic programming knowledge (already known to Claude)
- Temporary debugging steps not useful long-term
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that will become outdated quickly
- Duplicate memories of things already discovered

## Memory Quality Standards

- **Specificity**: Include concrete file paths, function names, and details
- **Conciseness**: One concept or discovery per memory
- **Actionability**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently
- **Scope accuracy**: Choose appropriate scope (global, file:, or area:)

Memories should be written so that future Claude assistants can immediately apply them without additional context or research.
