# Memory Extraction Guidelines

## What to Extract

Memories should capture:
- **Architectural decisions** - Why something was built a certain way
- **Bug fixes** - Root causes and solutions
- **Code patterns** - Conventions specific to this project
- **Configuration quirks** - Non-obvious setup or behavior
- **User preferences** - How the user works or wants to work
- **Important relationships** - How components interact
- **Performance insights** - Optimizations or trade-offs

## What NOT to Extract

Skip routine or temporary information:
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial facts
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Deduplication Strategy

- Use `occurred_at` timestamp + `content_hash` to detect duplicates
- Multiple sessions may extract the same memory
- Only keep the most recent/complete version
- Delete old memory if content significantly changes

## Session Context

Memories are more valuable when they include:
- File paths for code references
- Function/class names
- Concrete examples
- Root cause analysis
- Impact and relevance to the project
