The memory extraction prompt (memory-extraction.ts) provides detailed instructions to Claude for analyzing transcripts and creating memories. The prompt:

1. **DO extract**: Architectural decisions, bug fixes with root cause, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, performance optimizations
2. **DO NOT extract**: Generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious/trivial info, sensitive data, outdated information
3. **Output format**: JSON with memories array containing subject, keywords, applies_to, and content
4. **Scope guidance**: global (entire codebase), file:<path> (specific file), area:<name> (component/area)

The prompt emphasizes being specific, concise, actionable, and returning only raw JSON with no explanation or markdown formatting.
