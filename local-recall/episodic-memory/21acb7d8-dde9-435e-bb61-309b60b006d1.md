Local Recall provides three hooks that integrate with Claude Code:

1. **SessionStart Hook** (`src/hooks/session-start.ts`) - Triggered when a Claude Code session begins. Loads the memory index and outputs relevant memories to stdout for context injection.

2. **UserPromptSubmit Hook** (`src/hooks/user-prompt-submit.ts`) - Triggered before Claude processes a user prompt. Searches memory index and injects relevant memories based on semantic similarity.

3. **Stop Hook** (`src/hooks/stop.ts`) - Triggered when a session ends. Parses transcript and extracts new memories to persist for future sessions.

Hooks communicate via JSON stdin/stdout and are configured in `.claude/settings.json`.
