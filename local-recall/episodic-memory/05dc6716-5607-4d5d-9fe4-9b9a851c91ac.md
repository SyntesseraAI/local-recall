# Claude Project Transcripts Storage

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Project Folder Naming

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Forward slashes `/` are converted to underscores `_`
- The full path becomes the folder name

### Example
For working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`:
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory:
- Path: `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`
- Files are named with timestamps or session IDs
- Each line in the file is valid JSON

This is useful for the MCP server background daemon which syncs transcripts from this location to extract memories.
