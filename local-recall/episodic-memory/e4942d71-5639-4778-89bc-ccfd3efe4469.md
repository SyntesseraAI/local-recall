The local-recall plugin implements user-facing memory operations through skills stored in `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/skills/` directory. This provides a clean interface for Claude Code users to access memory functionality without direct MCP tool calls. Skills include memory checking and proactive recall operations that integrate with the core memory system.
