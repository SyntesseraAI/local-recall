The memory extraction process uses transcript condensing as an intermediate step before extracting memories. This approach:

1. Takes the full transcript and creates a condensed version using Claude Haiku
2. The condensing step improves efficiency by reducing token usage while preserving important information
3. Uses a specialized prompt (in memory-extraction.ts) to guide the condensing process
4. The condensed transcript is then used for memory extraction, making the extraction more focused and efficient

This two-step process (condense → extract) is more efficient than direct extraction from raw transcripts.
