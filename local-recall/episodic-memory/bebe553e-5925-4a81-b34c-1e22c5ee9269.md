# Transcript Parsing for Memory Extraction

The MCP server's background daemon processes Claude transcripts to extract memories.

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) containing structured conversation events:
- Each line is a complete JSON object representing a single event
- Events include user messages, assistant responses, and tool invocations
- Timestamp information is included for tracking when transcripts were created/modified

## Memory Extraction Process

1. Locate transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/<project-path>/transcripts/`
2. Parse `.jsonl` format (one JSON object per line)
3. Extract conversation context and identify memory-worthy information
4. Use content hashing to detect transcript changes and avoid duplicate memories
5. Process asynchronously every 5 minutes via the background daemon

## Key Consideration

The transcript format must be properly parsed to extract meaningful memories. Invalid JSON or malformed lines should be skipped gracefully.
