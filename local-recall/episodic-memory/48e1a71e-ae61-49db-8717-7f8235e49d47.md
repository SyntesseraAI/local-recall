# Memory Extraction and Session Context

## Key Discovery

Memory extraction from transcripts requires sufficient session context to be meaningful. Attempting to extract memories from:
- Empty transcripts
- Incomplete sessions
- Transcript fragments without proper event structure

Results in Claude Haiku producing generic or unusable memories.

## Why This Matters

The MCP server's transcript processing daemon needs to:
1. Verify transcript completeness before processing
2. Skip early-stage transcripts that lack sufficient context
3. Handle edge cases where transcript files exist but contain minimal data
4. Consider deferring extraction until a session has more meaningful events

## Workaround

When testing or working with incomplete transcripts:
- Ensure transcripts have meaningful content (user messages, tool invocations, results)
- Avoid processing single-event or bare-minimum transcripts
- Consider implementing minimum content threshold checks in the extraction pipeline
