When extracting memories from transcripts, the output format has strict requirements:

1. Return ONLY a valid JSON object with no additional text, explanation, or markdown formatting
2. No code blocks, no markdown headers, no narrative text
3. The JSON object must have a "memories" array
4. Each memory must include: subject, keywords, applies_to, and content
5. Content can use markdown format internally, but the output itself is raw JSON

This strict format ensures memories are machine-readable and can be properly stored and indexed.
