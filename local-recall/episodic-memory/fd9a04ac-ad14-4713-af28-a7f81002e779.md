Local Recall uses the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) via fastembed library for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use. First startup may take 30-60 seconds for download; subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file not found error occurs, remove `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` directory to reset the cache.
