The memory extractor module is responsible for parsing transcript files and extracting valuable memories. It handles deduplication by checking for duplicate memories based on occurred_at timestamp and content_hash before creating new memories. The extractor uses Claude Haiku to analyze transcripts and generate structured memories.
