The local-recall plugin is organized in `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/` with a `skills/` subdirectory containing skill definitions. The plugin maintains metadata and configuration files alongside skill definitions. Build and distribution happens through the dev-marketplace structure rather than the main src/ directory.
