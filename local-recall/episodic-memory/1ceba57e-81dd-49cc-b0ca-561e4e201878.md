The MemoryExtractor class processes transcripts by parsing them into condensed event format and chunking content when transcripts exceed size limits. This prevents overwhelming the Claude model with extremely long transcripts.

The chunking strategy breaks large transcripts into manageable pieces while maintaining context continuity. Each chunk is processed separately to extract relevant memories.
