# Memory Extraction with Condensed Transcripts

When extracting memories from session transcripts, use condensed transcript format rather than raw JSONL.

## Why

- Claude can process condensed events more efficiently
- Reduces token overhead from timestamp and metadata fields
- Makes it easier to identify actionable information
- Condenses multi-line user messages and assistant responses into summaries

## Implementation Pattern

The transcript-collector should:
1. Parse JSONL transcript files
2. Condense events to key information
3. Pass condensed transcript to memory extraction prompt
4. Use the memory extraction system prompt template for consistency

## Current Usage

The user-prompt-submit hook uses this condensed format when analyzing transcripts for memory extraction.
