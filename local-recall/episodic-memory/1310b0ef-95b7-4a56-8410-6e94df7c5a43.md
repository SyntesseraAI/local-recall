# Memory Extraction Process

The local-recall system extracts valuable memories from Claude Code session transcripts by:

1. **Analyzing the transcript**: Understanding what was learned, discovered, and accomplished
2. **Identifying keywords**: Extracting searchable terms relevant to the discovery
3. **Determining scope**: Deciding whether the memory applies globally, to a specific file, or to a component area
4. **Creating structured memories**: Storing memories as markdown files with YAML frontmatter

## Memory Extraction Guidelines

DO extract:
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

DO NOT extract:
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Quickly outdated information
