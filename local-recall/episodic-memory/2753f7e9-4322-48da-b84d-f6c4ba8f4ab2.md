The memory extraction system works in conjunction with transcript-collector to continuously extract and store memories from Claude Code sessions. After transcripts are collected and condensed, they are passed to the memory extraction system which uses Claude to intelligently identify and create memory files. This creates a feedback loop where each session improves the memory index for future sessions.
