## Memory Extraction Process

The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku in prompt mode to intelligently extract keywords from transcripts:

### How It Works

1. **Prompt Mode**: Uses `claude -p --model haiku` to send a prompt and get a response
2. **Input**: Accepts a transcript (or portion of it) as input
3. **Output**: Claude extracts relevant keywords that represent concepts/topics from the transcript
4. **Efficiency**: Haiku is used instead of Sonnet to keep costs and latency low

### Integration Points

- Used in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` to extract keywords from session transcripts
- Keywords are used to create memory files with searchable metadata
- The extracted keywords help index memories for later retrieval

### Important Considerations

- Keywords should be specific and relevant to the content
- The extraction happens asynchronously (in background daemon)
- Extracted keywords must be lowercase and concise
- The process helps create searchable, categorized memories from raw transcript data
