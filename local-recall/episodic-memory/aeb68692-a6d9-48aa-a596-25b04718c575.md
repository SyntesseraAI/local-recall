All new features must have corresponding unit tests in `tests/unit/` and integration tests in `tests/integration/`. Documentation must be in `docs/` folder. Existing docs must be updated when modifying functionality. Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases. This is a core development requirement for the project.
