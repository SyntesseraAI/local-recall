The SessionStart hook reads the 5 most recent memories directly from the episodic-memory/ directory by file modification time, without using vector search. This is intentional for performance - it avoids expensive embedding operations at session start. Memories are sorted by `occurred_at` timestamp in descending order and output to stdout for context injection.
