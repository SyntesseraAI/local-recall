Thinking memories now combine Claude's internal reasoning (thinking block) with the corresponding text output that follows it. This creates complete thought→output examples that help future sessions understand how Claude reasoned about similar problems.

**Implementation details:**
- Extracts both ThinkingContent and TextContent from the same AssistantMessageEntry
- Skips tool-only responses (responses with no text output)
- Stores in markdown format with sections: `## Thought` and `## Output`
- Keeps the full output without truncation for complete context

This is more useful than storing thoughts alone because it provides concrete examples of reasoning paired with the actual output produced.
