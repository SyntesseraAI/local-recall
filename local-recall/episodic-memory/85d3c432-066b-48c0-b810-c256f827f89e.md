When configuring Local Recall as a Claude Code plugin, use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in hook commands and scripts. This variable is resolved to the plugin installation path, enabling portable configuration across different machines. The plugin root is the project directory itself, not a subdirectory.
