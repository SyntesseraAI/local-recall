# Memory Files as Version-Controlled Knowledge Base

Memory files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` are intentionally version-controlled and committed to git.

## Key Characteristics

- **Location**: `local-recall/episodic-memory/*.md`
- **Format**: Markdown with YAML frontmatter
- **Git Status**: Tracked and committed (appears in git history)
- **Lifespan**: Long-lived, persistent memories that improve over time
- **Sharing**: All team members have access to the same memories

## What's NOT Tracked

- `local-recall/index.json` - Auto-generated index (gitignored)
- `local-recall/recall.log` - Debug log file (gitignored)

## Why This Matters

Memories represent valuable knowledge about:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Discovered bugs and their fixes
- Code patterns and conventions
- Project-specific preferences
- Important context about the codebase

By tracking them in git, this knowledge is preserved in project history and shared with all team members and AI assistants working on the project.

## Memory Atomicity

Each memory should focus on one concept or discovery. This makes them more reusable and searchable.
