# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

A transcript condensing feature has been implemented to compress full transcripts into condensed format before memory extraction.

## Purpose

Reduce token usage when using Claude Haiku to extract memories from transcripts. Instead of sending the full transcript to Claude, a condensed version is sent.

## Implementation Details

- Located in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`
- The `condenseTranscript()` function compresses dialogue while preserving key information
- Condensing happens before sending transcripts to Claude for memory extraction
- This optimization reduces API costs and processing time for memory extraction

## Benefits

- Faster memory extraction from transcripts
- Lower token usage (cost reduction)
- Maintains essential context needed for memory creation
