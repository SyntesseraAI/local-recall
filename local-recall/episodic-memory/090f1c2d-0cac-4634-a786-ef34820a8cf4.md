The memory extraction system processes transcripts by condensing them into structured events before sending to Claude for analysis. The condensed format uses clear markers:
- `[User]` - User requests and questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations with names
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool operations

This condensed format allows Claude to focus on extracting valuable memories without processing verbose raw transcript data. The system also includes metadata about the project context (working directory, session type) to help Claude understand scope.

Memories should follow strict extraction guidelines:
- Be specific with file paths and function names
- Focus on one concept per memory
- Use appropriate scope (global, file:, or area:)
- Extract architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, and conventions
- Avoid generic knowledge or temporary debugging steps
