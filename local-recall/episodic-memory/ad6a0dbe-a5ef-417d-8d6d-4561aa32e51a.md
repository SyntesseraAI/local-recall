The memory extraction process uses a carefully crafted prompt template (in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) that:

1. Asks Claude Haiku to analyze condensed transcripts
2. Extracts structured information including:
   - Relevant keywords for searching
   - Subject line summarizing the memory
   - Applicable scope (global, file, or area)
   - Content/details of the memory
3. Guides the model to identify what's worth remembering vs. temporary debugging steps
4. Ensures extracted memories are specific, actionable, and relevant to future sessions

This prompt-driven approach allows flexible adaptation of what gets extracted without code changes.
