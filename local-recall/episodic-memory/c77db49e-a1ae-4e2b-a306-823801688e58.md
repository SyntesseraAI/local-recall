# Stop Hook Status

The Stop hook is currently **disabled** in the local-recall project.

## Current Architecture

Instead of processing memories synchronously in the Stop hook, memory extraction is handled by:
- **MCP Server Daemon**: Runs as a background process
- **Processing Interval**: Every 5 minutes
- **Async Processing**: Transcripts are processed asynchronously

## How It Works

1. MCP server periodically scans the transcripts directory
2. Detects new or modified transcript files using content hash comparison
3. Processes transcripts to extract memories
4. Creates memory files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
5. Updates index.json for searchability

## Why This Approach

This design prevents the Stop hook from being a bottleneck and allows transcript processing to happen independently of the user's session termination.
