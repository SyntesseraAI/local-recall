# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored in JSONL format (`.jsonl` extension) in the `transcripts/` subdirectory within each project folder.

This location is used by the local-recall MCP server to sync and process transcripts for memory extraction.
