The MemoryExtractor converts full transcripts into a condensed format before sending to Claude for memory extraction. This condensed format includes:
- [User] events for user requests
- [Assistant] events for Claude responses
- [Tool: Name] events for tool invocations
- [Result: OK/ERROR] events for outcomes

This reduces token usage while preserving essential information for memory extraction.
