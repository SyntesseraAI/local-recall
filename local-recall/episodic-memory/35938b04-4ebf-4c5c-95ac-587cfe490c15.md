The transcript structure stores thinking and output together in the same `AssistantMessageEntry`:

- `ThinkingContent` blocks contain Claude's internal reasoning
- `TextContent` blocks contain the visible output
- `ToolUseContent` blocks contain tool calls

This means thinking and output don't require looking at the 'next' message - they're already paired in the same entry. This is why combining them into a single memory makes sense: they're already associated in the transcript data structure.

File: `src/types/transcript-schema.ts` defines the structure.
