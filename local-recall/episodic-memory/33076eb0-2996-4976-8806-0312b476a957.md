When extracting memories from transcripts using Claude Haiku, transcripts are condensed into a compact format before being sent to Claude:

- **User entries**: `[User] <prompt text>`
- **Assistant entries**: `[Assistant] <response summary>`
- **Tool entries**: `[Tool: ToolName] <invocation details>`
- **Results**: `[Result: OK/ERROR] <result details>`

This condensed format reduces token usage while preserving the essential information needed for memory extraction. The memory extractor expects this format and relies on it being pre-processed before sending to Claude.
