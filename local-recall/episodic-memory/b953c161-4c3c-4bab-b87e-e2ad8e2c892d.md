Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The ~133MB model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use. First run may take 30-60 seconds while downloading, subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file not found error occurs, remove corrupted cache (rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*) to trigger re-download.
