The memory extraction process in memory-extractor.ts uses the Claude API with streaming enabled to process transcripts efficiently. This approach reduces token consumption by streaming responses rather than waiting for the full completion. The system processes condensed transcripts to extract valuable memories that help future AI assistants work on the codebase.
