The `MemoryExtractor` class in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` processes transcripts through a structured pipeline:

1. **Condensing phase**: Reduces full transcript to key events and decisions
2. **Extraction phase**: Sends condensed transcript to Claude for memory extraction
3. **Validation phase**: Validates extracted memories before storage
4. **Error handling**: Gracefully handles errors without stopping the entire process

The extractor:
- Takes a full transcript as input
- Returns an array of extracted memories
- Handles cases where extraction might fail or return no memories
- Integrates with the memory storage system

Key method: `extractMemories(transcript: string): Promise<Memory[]>`

This design ensures robust memory extraction that doesn't break the larger system if individual extraction attempts fail.
