All new features must have:
- Corresponding unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/` where appropriate
- Documentation in `docs/` folder
- Updated existing docs when modifying functionality
- Tests covering both happy paths and edge cases

Build output goes to `scripts/` directory (gitignored), with TypeScript compiled via `npm run build`.
