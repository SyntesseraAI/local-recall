The vector store implementation (src/core/vector-store.ts) uses better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for efficient semantic search. Embeddings are generated using fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model. Search results use cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0 range) with recency tie-breaker when scores are equal.
