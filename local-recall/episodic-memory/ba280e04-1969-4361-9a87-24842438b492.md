Memory extraction is a fundamental component of Local Recall's memory system:

- Analyzes session transcripts to identify and extract valuable insights
- Creates structured memory records with metadata (frontmatter + content)
- Generates embeddings for vector-based semantic search
- Prevents duplicate memories through content hashing
- Enables future AI assistants to learn from past sessions
- Integrates with MCP server for automated background processing
