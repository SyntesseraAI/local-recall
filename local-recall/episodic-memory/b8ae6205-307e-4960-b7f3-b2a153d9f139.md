Local Recall uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. Important performance considerations:
- **First run**: 30-60 second initialization while model downloads to `local_cache/`
- **Subsequent runs**: Fast, loads from cache
- **Cache corruption**: If tokenizer file not found error occurs, delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to force re-download

This is documented in troubleshooting section and users should be aware of initial slowness.
