Memory files include an `occurred_at` field (ISO-8601 timestamp) that tracks when the original event occurred. This is critical for deduplication - the system can identify duplicate memories by checking if a memory with the same `occurred_at` and `content_hash` already exists. Search results are sorted by this timestamp.
