The MCP server runs a background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. This daemon syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, extracts memories using the Claude API, and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes to detect changes. This prevents the need for synchronous processing during the Stop hook.
