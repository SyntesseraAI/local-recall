The memory extraction system in memory-extractor.ts uses Claude Haiku via the Anthropic SDK to analyze session transcripts and extract meaningful memories. The extraction prompt is defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts and guides Claude to identify:

- What was learned or discovered
- Architectural decisions and patterns
- Bug fixes and root causes
- Configuration quirks and conventions
- Code patterns specific to the project

The extractor processes transcripts by sending them to Claude with a structured prompt that returns JSON-formatted memories ready for storage.
