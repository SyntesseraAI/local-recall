When implementing transcript collection and memory extraction, ensure that system-generated messages prefixed with `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` are filtered out before analysis. These are internal hook outputs and should not be treated as user content or part of the actual session transcript.

This is especially important when:
- Processing transcripts for memory creation
- Extracting keywords from user prompts
- Building the memory index
- Analyzing session history
