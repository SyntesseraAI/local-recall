The `ensureGitignore()` method was updated to create the base `local-recall` directory using `fs.mkdirSync()` if it doesn't already exist. This ensures the method works on fresh projects where the local-recall folder hasn't been initialized yet.

**Location**: `src/core/index.ts`, line 210

**Purpose**: Handles the case where a session starts on a project with no local-recall directory at all.
