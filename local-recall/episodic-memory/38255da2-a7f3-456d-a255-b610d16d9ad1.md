# Transcript JSON Structure

Claude Code transcripts are stored as JSONL where each line is a complete JSON object representing a transcript event.

## Event Types

Transcripts contain different event types:
1. **User messages** - What the user requested
2. **Assistant messages** - What Claude said or explained
3. **Tool invocations** - When Claude invoked tools (Read, Edit, Bash, etc.)
4. **Tool results** - Outcomes of tool invocations (OK/ERROR with result data)

## Event Structure

Each event is a JSON object with:
- `type` field indicating the event type
- Type-specific fields containing the event details

The exact schema should be defined in `src/types/transcript-schema.ts` to properly parse and process these events.

## Implications for Memory Extraction

Memory extraction from transcripts needs to:
1. Parse JSONL format correctly (one JSON object per line)
2. Filter and identify relevant event types
3. Reconstruct context from sequences of events
4. Extract actionable insights from the conversation flow

The transcript structure is fundamental to how the Local Recall background daemon processes transcripts into memories.
