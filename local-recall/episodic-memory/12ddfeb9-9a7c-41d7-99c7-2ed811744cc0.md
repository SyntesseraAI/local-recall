The memory extractor uses Claude's API (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 model) to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. To improve efficiency and reduce token usage, transcripts are condensed before being sent to Claude - this removes verbose tool outputs and redundant information while preserving the essential context needed for memory extraction. The extraction process creates memories with metadata fields (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash) that are stored as markdown files in the episodic-memory directory.
