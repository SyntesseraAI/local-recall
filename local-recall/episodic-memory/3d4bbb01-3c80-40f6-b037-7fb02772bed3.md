The vector store uses BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model from the fastembed library with 384 dimensions per embedding vector. This is an asymmetric embedding model, meaning queries and passages are embedded differently - passages use `passageEmbed()` for better document representation while queries use `queryEmbed()` for better search matching. Memories are embedded by combining subject and content: `${memory.subject}\n\n${memory.content}`. Search queries are embedded directly as the user's prompt text.
