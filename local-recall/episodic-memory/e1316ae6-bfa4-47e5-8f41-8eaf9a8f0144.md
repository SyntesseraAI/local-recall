Before sending transcripts to Claude for memory extraction, they are condensed using the transcript-collector to reduce token consumption. The condensed format uses `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, and `[Tool: Name]` event markers to create a compact representation that maintains semantic meaning while reducing size by ~70%.
