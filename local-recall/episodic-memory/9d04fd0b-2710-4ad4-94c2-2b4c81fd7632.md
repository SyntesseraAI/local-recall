The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the claude-sdk library to make streaming API calls to Claude for analyzing transcripts. It passes a system prompt and transcript content to Claude's API and processes the response as it streams back, which is more efficient than waiting for full responses.
