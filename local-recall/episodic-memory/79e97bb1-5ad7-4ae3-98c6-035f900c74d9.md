# CLAUDE.md Project Instructions

The file `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/CLAUDE.md` contains important project-specific instructions and documentation that override default behavior.

## Key Contents

- **Architecture overview** - Directory structure and component relationships
- **Memory file format** - YAML frontmatter schema with required fields (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash)
- **Core components** - Memory Manager, Index Manager, Search implementation
- **Claude Code integration** - Hook configurations and MCP server setup
- **Development requirements** - Must create comprehensive tests and documentation for all new features
- **Conventions** - Memory files are version-controlled, index.json is gitignored, use provided tools rather than direct file manipulation

## Important Guidelines

- All new features must have unit tests in `tests/unit/` and integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Update `docs/` folder with documentation when modifying functionality
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases
- Memory files should be atomic (one concept per file)
- Consider scope carefully: `global` vs `file:` vs `area:`

This document should be reviewed when understanding project requirements and architectural decisions.
