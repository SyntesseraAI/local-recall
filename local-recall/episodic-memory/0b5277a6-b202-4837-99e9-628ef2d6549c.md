Claude Code provides session transcripts via hooks with paths in the format `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`. Memories are extracted from these transcripts during the Stop hook or asynchronously by the MCP daemon every 5 minutes. The daemon tracks processed transcripts using content hashes to detect changes and recreate memories when transcripts are updated.
