Memory creation is idempotent - it checks for duplicates using `findDuplicate()` which compares the `occurred_at` timestamp and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix) against existing memories. If a duplicate is found, the existing memory is returned instead of creating a new one. This prevents redundant memory storage from repeated operations.
