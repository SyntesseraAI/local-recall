# Hook Path Configuration

The `hooks.json` file uses `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable syntax to reference script paths.

## Details

- All hook commands reference scripts using: `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/hooks/<hook-name>.js`
- This allows hooks to work regardless of where the plugin is installed
- The `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is automatically resolved by Claude Code at runtime
- Alternative: hooks can be configured directly in `.claude/settings.json` with absolute paths or relative paths from the project root

## Current Configuration

local-recall's `hooks.json` uses this pattern for all three hooks:
- SessionStart
- UserPromptSubmit  
- Stop (currently disabled)
