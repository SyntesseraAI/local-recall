Local Recall uses `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use.

**Important considerations:**
- First run takes 30-60 seconds for initial download
- Subsequent runs load from cache
- If tokenizer.json is missing or corrupted, remove entire `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` directory to force re-download
- Model provides semantic understanding beyond keyword matching
