# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:

- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`
- Transcripts location: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) files, where each line is a separate JSON object representing an event in the conversation.

## Impact

The `transcript-collector.ts` needs to correctly transform the project's working directory path into this dashes-separated format to locate and read transcripts for memory extraction.
