The extraction prompt provides Claude with clear guidelines on what constitutes valuable memories:

**EXTRACT:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations applied

**DO NOT EXTRACT:**
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

The prompt also guides Claude on scope selection (global, file:path, area:name) and emphasizes the importance of specificity and actionability.
