The memory extractor includes transcript condensing functionality to reduce the size of transcripts before sending to Claude for memory extraction. This improves token efficiency and helps focus Claude's attention on the most relevant parts of the session. The condensing process likely removes verbose repetition and low-value content while preserving important decisions and learnings.
