The vector store implementation uses SQLite with sqlite-vec extension for semantic search. Search results are scored using cosine distance similarity (range 0.0-1.0, rounded to 2 decimals). Results are sorted by similarity score descending, with more recent memories (by `occurred_at` timestamp) used as tie-breaker when scores are equal.
