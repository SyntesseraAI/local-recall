The memory extraction process in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses `TranscriptCondenser` to compress transcripts before sending them to Claude for analysis. This is necessary because full transcripts can exceed token limits. The condenser creates a condensed format that includes key events like user requests, assistant responses, and tool invocations while maintaining semantic meaning for memory extraction.
