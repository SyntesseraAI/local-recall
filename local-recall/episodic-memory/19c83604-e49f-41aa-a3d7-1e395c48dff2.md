The memory extraction prompt is designed to:

1. Accept condensed transcripts as input
2. Include session context (working directory, session info) to make memories more relevant
3. Guide Claude to extract memories in the correct YAML frontmatter format
4. Request specific fields: id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash
5. Output valid markdown with frontmatter for direct file creation

The prompt ensures extracted memories have proper structure and are ready to be written directly to the file system without additional processing.
