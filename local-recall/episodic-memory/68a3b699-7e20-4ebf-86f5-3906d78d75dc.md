Memory extraction behavior is driven by prompts stored in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts. This centralized configuration approach:

- Separates prompt engineering from extraction logic
- Allows easy updates to extraction criteria without code changes
- Uses Claude Haiku for cost-effective transcript processing
- Defines what constitutes valuable memories and how they should be structured
- Ensures consistency in memory format and quality across sessions

Future modifications to extraction behavior should update the prompts module rather than the extractor logic.
