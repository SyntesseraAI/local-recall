# Memory Extraction Keyword Process

The memory extraction pipeline relies on extracting meaningful keywords from transcript content to populate the memory index for semantic search.

## Current Implementation Challenge

The `memory-extractor.ts` currently depends on calling Claude Haiku via `claude -p` to extract keywords from transcript content. This creates a dependency on:
- Claude's CLI being available
- The project's Claude Code configuration
- External API calls during extraction

## Considerations

- Keyword extraction is critical for the search functionality
- Future optimization: Could implement local keyword extraction without external API calls
- Keywords should be specific and relevant to help with fuzzy matching
- The abstraction of this process may be beneficial for testing and modularity
