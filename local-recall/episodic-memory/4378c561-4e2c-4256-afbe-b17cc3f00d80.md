Transcripts are condensed before being sent to the memory extraction prompt. This optimization reduces token usage and focuses the extraction on key events rather than raw transcript content. The condensing process transforms transcripts into a simplified event-based format with `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]` markers to make them more digestible for analysis.
