SessionStart hook loads 5 most recent memories on session init (avoiding vector store for speed). UserPromptSubmit hook performs semantic search before processing user prompts. Stop hook is disabled - memory extraction handled by MCP server daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. Hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json`.
