Transcripts are condensed into a compact event format before being sent to Claude for memory extraction. This reduces token usage and improves processing efficiency. The condensed format includes [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], and [Result: OK/ERROR] events, making it easier for Claude to analyze what happened in the session.
