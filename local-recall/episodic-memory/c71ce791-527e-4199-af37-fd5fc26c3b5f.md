The memory extraction system uses transcript condensing as a preprocessing step before sending transcripts to Claude for analysis. This reduces token usage and API costs while maintaining the essential information needed for memory extraction. The condensing process is implemented in the transcript-collector module and helps optimize the memory extraction workflow.
