CLAUDE.md still references sqlite-vec and mutex lock issues from the pre-Orama architecture. Should be updated to reflect that: (1) the main codebase now uses pure-JavaScript Orama with no mutex issues in the core library, (2) mutex contention only occurs in hook processes due to fastembed's onnxruntime-node dependency, (3) the daemon HTTP architecture mentioned in diagrams was removed during migration.
