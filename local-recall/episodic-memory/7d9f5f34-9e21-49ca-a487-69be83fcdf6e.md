The Local Recall architecture separates transcript processing into distinct stages: 1) Raw transcripts are collected from Claude's cache, 2) Transcripts are condensed via `transcript-condenser.ts` to extract events ([User], [Assistant], [Tool], [Result]), 3) Condensed transcripts are passed to the memory extractor which uses Claude to identify and extract memories. This separation allows each component to focus on one responsibility and makes the pipeline testable.
