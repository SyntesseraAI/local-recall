Updated `src/utils/gitignore.ts` to remove sqlite-related patterns that were lingering from the previous sqlite-vec architecture. The gitignore template is auto-generated by the memory system and should only contain patterns for Orama index files and runtime artifacts, not obsolete sqlite references.
