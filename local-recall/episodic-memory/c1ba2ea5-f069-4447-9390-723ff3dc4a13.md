Local Recall enables Claude Code and MCP-compatible tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings (fastembed + BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic search. All memories are version-controllable and shareable among team members.
