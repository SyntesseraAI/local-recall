When extracting memories using the [LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL] memory extraction prompt, the response must be returned as a raw JSON object without any markdown code block formatting. The instructions explicitly state 'ONLY a valid JSON object with no explanation, no markdown formatting, no code blocks - just raw JSON'. This is critical for proper memory file creation and parsing.
