The vector store (`src/core/vector-store.ts`) uses better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension for semantic similarity search. Embeddings are generated using fastembed with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB, cached in `local_cache/`). Search results use cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0-1.0 range, rounded to 2 decimal places). When scores are equal, more recent memories are ranked first as a tie-breaker.
