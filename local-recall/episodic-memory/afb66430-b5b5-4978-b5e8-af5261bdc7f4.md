Memory keywords should be:
- Lowercase
- Specific and searchable (not overly general)
- Between 1-10 keywords per memory
- Focused on terms that would help future assistants discover the memory

Good keywords are concrete terms like file names, function names, feature names, and architectural concepts relevant to the memory.
