The project version must be updated in two places to keep them synchronized:
1. `package.json` - Main package version
2. `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Plugin manifest version

When bumping versions (e.g., 0.1.1 → 0.1.2), both files must be updated together. After version changes, run `npm run build` to ensure the compiled distribution is up-to-date before committing.
