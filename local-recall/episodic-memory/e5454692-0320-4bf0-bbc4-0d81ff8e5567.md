The SessionStart hook uses a full disk reload via MemoryManager.listMemories() and returns the 5 most recent memories sorted by occurred_at. It intentionally does NOT use the vector store to avoid slow initialization on every session start. The vector store is only lazily initialized on the first UserPromptSubmit hook call.
