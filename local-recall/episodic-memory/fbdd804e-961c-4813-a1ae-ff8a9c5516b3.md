The MCP server in Local Recall includes a background daemon that:

1. **Syncs transcripts** from Claude's cache directory (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
2. **Processes transcripts** using `claude -p` command to extract memories
3. **Tracks processed transcripts** with content hashes for change detection
4. **Deletes and recreates memories** when transcripts change
5. **Runs on a 5-minute interval** for continuous background processing

This allows memories to be extracted asynchronously without blocking Claude's workflow. The Stop hook is currently disabled in favor of this background daemon approach.
