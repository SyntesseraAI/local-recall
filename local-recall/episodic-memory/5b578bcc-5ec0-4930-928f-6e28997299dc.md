Vector store search results use cosine distance similarity scoring (range 0.0 to 1.0, rounded to 2 decimal places). Results are ranked by similarity score descending. When similarity scores are equal, more recent memories (by occurred_at timestamp) are ranked first as a tie-breaker. This ensures both relevance and recency are considered in search results.
