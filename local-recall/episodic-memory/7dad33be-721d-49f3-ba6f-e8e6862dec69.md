The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model via the `claude -p` command to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. The extraction is driven by a structured prompt defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides the model to identify architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, and other learnings from session transcripts.
