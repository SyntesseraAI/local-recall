The `extractMemoriesFromTranscript()` function in `memory-extractor.ts` (line 305) uses `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` as the model for memory extraction. This choice provides a good balance between capability and cost, as Haiku can still understand and extract structured memories effectively while being significantly cheaper than larger models like Sonnet.
