Local Recall implements a plugin-based architecture in `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/` with reusable skills for memory operations. Two key skills were added: `check-memories` and `proactive-recall`. The plugin system improves tool discoverability through metadata and helps organize memory functionality into modular, reusable components.
