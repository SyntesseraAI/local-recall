The MemoryExtractor class in src/core/memory-extractor.ts uses Claude Haiku (via `claude -p --model haiku`) to process condensed transcripts and extract memories. The extraction uses a structured prompt that filters out internal LOCAL_RECALL metadata and focuses on user interactions and assistant insights. The prompt asks Claude to identify what was learned, code patterns, bug fixes, and architectural decisions while avoiding generic knowledge and temporary debugging steps. This approach ensures extracted memories are specific, actionable, and relevant to future sessions.
