When extracting memories:
- **Be specific**: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- **Be concise**: Focus on one concept per memory
- **Be actionable**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work efficiently
- **Avoid**: Generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, trivial info, sensitive data
- **Use appropriate scope**: `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`
