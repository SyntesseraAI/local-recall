Transcripts are condensed into a compact event-based format before being sent to Claude for memory extraction. This condensing process:

- Converts verbose Claude Code transcripts into structured events like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, `[Result: OK/ERROR]`
- Significantly reduces token usage when processing transcripts through Claude
- Preserves essential information while removing verbosity
- Makes it easier for Claude to parse and understand the session's key moments
- Enables the memory extraction system to focus on meaningful interactions rather than implementation details

This is implemented as part of the memory extraction pipeline and is critical for efficient memory generation.
