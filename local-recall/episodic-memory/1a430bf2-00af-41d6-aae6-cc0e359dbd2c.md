# Transcript Event Types and Structure

Claude transcripts are stored as JSONL files with the following event types:

## Event Types
1. **user_message** - User input to Claude
2. **assistant_message** - Claude's response
3. **tool_call** - Tool invocation by Claude
4. **tool_result** - Result of a tool execution

## Parsing Considerations

- Each line in a JSONL file is a separate event object
- Events have `type`, `timestamp`, and `content` fields
- Must be parsed line-by-line, not as a single JSON array
- Content structure varies by event type
- Timestamps are in ISO-8601 format for sorting and deduplication

This is important for `src/utils/transcript-collector.ts` when processing transcripts from Claude's cache.
