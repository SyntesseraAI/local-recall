Memory extraction prompts are stored in a dedicated prompts directory (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) rather than inline in the extractor logic. This separation allows for easy iteration on prompt engineering and reuse across different memory extraction scenarios. The prompt file contains the structured instructions Claude follows when analyzing transcripts.
