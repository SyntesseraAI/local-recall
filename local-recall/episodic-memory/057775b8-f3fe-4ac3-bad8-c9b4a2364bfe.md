Hooks execute as shell commands receiving JSON via stdin. SessionStart hook (lazy, full reload) loads 5 most recent memories by occurred_at without using vector store to avoid slow initialization. UserPromptSubmit hook performs semantic search using vector embeddings before Claude processes user input. Both hooks output memory content to stdout for context injection. Stop hook is disabled; memory extraction is handled by MCP server daemon running every 5 minutes.
