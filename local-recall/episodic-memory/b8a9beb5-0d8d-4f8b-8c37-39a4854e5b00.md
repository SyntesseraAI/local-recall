# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`
- Transcripts location: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line):
- Each line represents a single message in the conversation
- Files can be read line-by-line to parse individual message events
- Timestamp and content information is included in each line

This is important for the transcript-collector component which syncs transcripts from Claude's cache.
