# Local Recall Project Setup

## Technology Stack

- TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Node.js based project
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration
- Hook-based architecture for Claude Code integration
- Memory stored as markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`

## Build and Development

- Uses npm for package management
- Compiled TypeScript output goes to `dist/` directory
- Scripts are bundled for distribution
- Active branch: `claude/refactor-memory-collection-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`

## Memory System Architecture

Memories are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter containing:
- Unique ID
- Subject (brief description)
- Keywords (searchable terms)
- Scope (global, file, or area)
- Occurred timestamp
- Content hash for deduplication
