Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. Memory files are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` as markdown with YAML frontmatter. Each memory has fields: id (UUID), subject, keywords (array), applies_to (global/file:<path>/area:<name>), occurred_at (ISO-8601), and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix). Memory files are version-controlled in git, while memory.sqlite is gitignored.
