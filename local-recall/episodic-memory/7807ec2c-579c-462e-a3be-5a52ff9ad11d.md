Memory extraction relies on a dedicated prompt file (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) that guides Claude Haiku in analyzing condensed transcripts. The prompt:

1. Provides context about the project and memory system
2. Defines what should and shouldn't be extracted
3. Specifies output format (JSON with memories array)
4. Includes guidelines for scope (global, file:, area:)
5. Emphasizes specificity, conciseness, and actionability

This structured prompt ensures consistent and high-quality memory extraction across sessions.
