Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/` where the encoded path matches the repository folder name. Example: `/Users/joe/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/` for the local-recall project.

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with names following the pattern `transcript-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.jsonl`. Each line is a JSON object representing a turn in the conversation.

This is critical for the MCP daemon that processes transcripts to extract memories - it needs to know where Claude stores these files on disk.
