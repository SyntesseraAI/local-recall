Local Recall is a project that creates a persistent memory layer allowing Claude Code and other AI tools via MCP to retain information and context across sessions. Memories are stored as structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory and are version-controllable and shareable among team members.
