# Fuzzy Matching Threshold Consideration

The current fuzzy matching implementation uses a threshold of 0.6 (60% similarity required).

## Potential Issue

This threshold may be too strict for practical keyword search:
- Keywords often have typos or variations (e.g., "useEffect" vs "use-effect")
- Users may search with partial terms
- Related keywords may not match above 0.6 threshold

## Recommendation

Consider lowering the threshold to 0.4-0.5 for more inclusive search results, or make it configurable via the configuration system. Monitor false positives and adjust based on user feedback.
