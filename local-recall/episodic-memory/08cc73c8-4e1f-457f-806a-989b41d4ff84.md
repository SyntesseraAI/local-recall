The Index Manager in `src/core/index.ts` maintains a searchable index stored at `local-recall/index.json`. It scans all memory files and builds a keyword index for fast access. Functions include `buildIndex()` to create the index, `getIndex()` to retrieve it, and `refreshIndex()` to rebuild from scratch. The index.json file is gitignored as it's auto-generated. This enables efficient fuzzy search across memories using the search module.
