Simplified the summarizeText and generateSubject functions:
- Removed ts-textrank npm package from dependencies
- generateSubject now uses simple logic:
  - For multi-line text: take the first line
  - For single-line text: take up to first '.', or all text if no period exists
- Updated src/utils/summarize.ts and src/utils/transcript.ts
- All related tests updated to match new behavior
- This reduces complexity and removes unnecessary dependency
