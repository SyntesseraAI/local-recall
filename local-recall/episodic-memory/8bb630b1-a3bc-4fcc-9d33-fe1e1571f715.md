Extracting valuable memories from transcripts is non-trivial because it requires semantic understanding of what was discussed. Using Claude Haiku to extract keywords from user prompts is effective, but transcript-based memory extraction requires understanding the conversation context and identifying when new insights were gained. Deduplication by content hash prevents storing duplicate memories from similar discussions.
