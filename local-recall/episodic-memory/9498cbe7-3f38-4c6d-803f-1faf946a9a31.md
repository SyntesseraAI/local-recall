Memory files use the `applies_to` field to specify their scope:
- `global` - Memory applies to the entire codebase
- `file:<path>` - Memory is specific to a particular file
- `area:<name>` - Memory relates to a functional area or component

This scope determines when memories are retrieved: SessionStart hook loads memories for the current context, UserPromptSubmit searches memories based on keywords and scope relevance.
