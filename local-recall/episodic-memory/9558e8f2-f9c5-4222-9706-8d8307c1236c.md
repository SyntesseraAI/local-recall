The memory extraction prompts are defined in a separate file (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) rather than hardcoded in the extractor. This allows for:

- Centralized prompt management and updates
- Easy modification of extraction criteria without touching the core extractor logic
- Consistency across extraction operations
- Version control of prompt changes

When modifying memory extraction behavior, update the prompts in this file rather than the extractor implementation.
