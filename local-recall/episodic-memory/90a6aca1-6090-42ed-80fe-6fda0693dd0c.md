The MCP server runs a background daemon that periodically processes Claude transcripts to extract memories. The daemon:
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache at `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
- Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
- Runs every 5 minutes

This allows asynchronous memory extraction without blocking the user's workflow.
