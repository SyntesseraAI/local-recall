Local Recall uses a markdown-based memory system with YAML frontmatter. Each memory file is stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` as a UUID.md file with metadata fields: id (UUID), subject (brief description), keywords (array), applies_to (scope), occurred_at (ISO-8601 timestamp), and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix). Memory files are version-controlled in git, while memory.sqlite and recall.log are gitignored.
