The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku API to process transcripts and extract memories. It sends transcripts to the Claude API with a structured prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and expects JSON output containing memory objects. The system validates extracted memories and handles API errors gracefully.
