# Local Recall Refactoring Status

The local-recall codebase is currently undergoing a significant refactoring of the memory collection system.

## New Components Being Added

- `src/core/embedding.ts` - New embedding functionality (currently untracked)
- `src/core/vector-store.ts` - New vector store implementation (currently untracked)

## Recent Changes

- Deleted: `src/core/index.ts` - Old index creation and management
- Refactored: `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` - Enhanced memory extraction
- Refactored: Multiple hook and core files for the new architecture

## Current State

The refactoring includes standardizing string quotes, improving logging consistency, and implementing transcript condensing for memory extraction. The project is on a feature branch: `claude/refactor-memory-collection-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`
