The vector store (`src/core/vector-store.ts`) uses better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension for semantic similarity search. Embeddings are generated using fastembed with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). The database file (`local-recall/memory.sqlite`) is gitignored and auto-generated. Search results use cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0) with recency as a tie-breaker.
