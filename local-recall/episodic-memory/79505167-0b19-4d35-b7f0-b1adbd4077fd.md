# Transcript File Format

Claude Code stores transcripts as JSONL (JSON Lines) files where each line is a separate JSON object representing a transcript event.

## Format Details

- Each line contains one complete JSON object
- No array wrapping - lines are parsed individually
- Each object represents a single event in the transcript
- Common event types include user prompts, assistant responses, and tool invocations

## Parsing Implementation

When reading transcript files:
1. Open the JSONL file
2. Read line by line
3. Parse each line as individual JSON (not the entire file as one JSON object)
4. Accumulate parsed events into an array or process them sequentially

This is different from standard JSON array format and requires line-by-line parsing.
