The memory extraction process analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to identify and extract valuable memories that will help future AI assistants. It focuses on what was learned, what is now known, specific codebase patterns, and problems solved. Memories should be specific with file paths and function names, concise with one concept per memory, and actionable to help future work. The extraction avoids generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and sensitive data.
