# Memory Extraction Task

The user requested a memory extraction task where the assistant should:
1. Analyze a Claude Code session transcript
2. Extract valuable memories that will help future AI assistants
3. Return results as a JSON object with a "memories" array
4. Each memory needs: subject, keywords, applies_to, and content fields
5. Return ONLY raw JSON with no explanation or markdown formatting

This is a meta-task used for analyzing session transcripts and preserving knowledge.
