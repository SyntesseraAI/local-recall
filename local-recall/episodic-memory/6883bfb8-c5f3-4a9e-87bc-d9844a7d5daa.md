# TranscriptCollector Implementation Notes

## Transcript File Discovery

When discovering transcript files:
1. Use glob patterns to find `.jsonl` files in the transcripts directory
2. Handle cases where the transcripts directory doesn't exist yet (new projects)
3. Filter by timestamp ranges when needed
4. Sort files by creation order (newest first or oldest first depending on use case)

## Key Considerations

- The transcripts directory may not exist in new projects - don't fail, just return empty results
- Use absolute paths when working with the transcripts directory
- Timestamp parsing from filenames: ISO-8601 format with timezone info
- May need to handle concurrent file creation during active sessions
