Before sending transcripts to Claude for memory extraction, the `condenseTranscript()` function is used to reduce token usage. The condensed transcript format follows the pattern: `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, `[Result: OK/ERROR]` to capture the essential information while removing verbose output. This preprocessing step happens before the structured memory extraction prompt is applied, making the extraction more efficient and focused.
