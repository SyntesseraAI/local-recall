Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files stored in local-recall/ directory. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings (BGE-small-en-v1.5 via fastembed) for semantic search. All memories are version-controllable and stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter containing metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash).
