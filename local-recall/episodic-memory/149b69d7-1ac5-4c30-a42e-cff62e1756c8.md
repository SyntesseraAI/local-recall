The LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL memory extraction process analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to identify and capture valuable memories that help future AI assistants. The process:

1. Reviews what was learned and new insights gained
2. Identifies important facts about codebase, architecture, and conventions
3. Notes unique patterns, configurations, or quirks
4. Documents problems solved and how they were resolved

Memories should be specific (include file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help avoid mistakes). Scope is important: `global` for codebase-wide, `file:<path>` for specific files, `area:<name>` for components.
