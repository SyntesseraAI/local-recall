Hooks are configured in hooks.json and execute as shell commands:
- **SessionStart**: Loads 5 most recent memories (sorted by occurred_at) on session begin
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Performs semantic search on user prompt before Claude processes it
- **Stop**: Parses transcript and creates memories (currently handled by async MCP server daemon)

Hooks receive JSON input with session_id, transcript_path, cwd, and optional prompt. Output is injected into Claude's context.
