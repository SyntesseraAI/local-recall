The project maintains memory extraction instructions in a separate `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` module rather than embedding them directly in the extractor. This provides:

- Centralized management of the extraction prompt and instructions
- Easier testing and iteration on prompt effectiveness
- Clear separation between prompt content and execution logic
- Ability to version and document prompt changes

This pattern follows best practices for prompt engineering and makes it easier to tune extraction quality without modifying core extraction logic.
