Local Recall integrates with Claude Code via three hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json`:
- **SessionStart**: Loads 5 most recent memories (sorted by occurred_at) on session begin
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Performs semantic search on user prompt before Claude processes it
- **Stop**: Currently disabled; memory extraction handled asynchronously by MCP server daemon

Hooks receive JSON via stdin and output memory content to stdout for context injection.
