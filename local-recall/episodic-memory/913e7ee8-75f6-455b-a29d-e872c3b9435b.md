# User Development Preferences

Based on the architecture decisions in the project:

1. **Async Over Sync**: The MCP server uses background polling (every 5 minutes) rather than stopping the Stop hook synchronously. This indicates a preference for non-blocking, asynchronous processing.

2. **Markdown as Memory Format**: All memories are stored as structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter. This suggests preference for human-readable, version-controllable memory format.

3. **Local-First Approach**: All memories are stored locally in the repository, making them version-controllable and shareable with git. No external database or cloud storage.

4. **Index-Based Search**: Rather than full-text database queries, the system uses a built keyword index for faster fuzzy search - suggesting preference for simplicity and offline capability.
