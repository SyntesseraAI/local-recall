The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku via the `claude -p` command to parse session transcripts and extract memories. It sends a system prompt (defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) along with the transcript content to Haiku, which returns structured memory objects that are then saved to disk. This approach leverages Claude's understanding to identify what's worth remembering from raw transcript data.
