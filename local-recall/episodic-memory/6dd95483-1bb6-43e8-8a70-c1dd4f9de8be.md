The `local-recall/` folder should have a `.gitignore` that excludes:
- `transcripts/` - Directory containing transcript files
- `processed-log.json` - File tracking which transcripts have been processed

These are dynamically generated and should not be version-controlled. The gitignore template is maintained in two places that must stay in sync:
1. `src/core/index.ts` - Line ~98 in the `ensureGitignore()` function
2. `src/core/memory.ts` - Same template used for initialization

When updating the template, both files must be changed together to ensure consistency.
