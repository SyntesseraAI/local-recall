Claude stores project transcripts in ~/.claude/projects/ directory. Project directories use URL-encoded paths (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/` for `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`). Individual sessions are stored as `.jsonl` files with timestamps. This is important for the MCP server daemon that syncs and processes transcripts.
