Local Recall is a memory system that extracts and stores valuable knowledge from Claude Code session transcripts. It uses automated memory extraction (via Claude Haiku analyzing condensed transcripts) to identify architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and project-specific quirks that help future AI assistants work more effectively on the codebase. The extracted memories are stored with metadata (keywords, scope, occurrence timestamp) for searchability and relevance.
