The Stop hook is currently disabled. Memory extraction is handled by the MCP server daemon which:
- Runs every 5 minutes
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/)
- Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change

This asynchronous approach avoids blocking the session end process.
