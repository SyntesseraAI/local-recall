All internal Local Recall prompts (like keyword extraction) should prefix the prompt with [LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL] token. This allows the recursion guard to detect internal prompts without relying on prompt content matching, making it easier to test with similar prompts and providing more reliable prevention of hook recursion.
