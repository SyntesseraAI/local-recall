The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku model to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. The extraction process is driven by structured prompts defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guide the model to identify and format memories appropriately. The actual extraction logic is implemented in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts`.
