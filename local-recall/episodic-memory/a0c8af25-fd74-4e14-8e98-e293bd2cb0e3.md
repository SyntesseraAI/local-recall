The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. The implementation uses streaming to efficiently process transcript data. The system integrates with memory creation to deduplicate memories based on content hash and occurred_at timestamp, preventing duplicate memory entries from the same event.
