Memory extraction is part of the broader memory lifecycle in Local Recall:

- Transcripts are analyzed to identify valuable information
- Extraction happens after user sessions or at specific triggers
- The process is designed to be asynchronous and non-blocking
- Multiple transcripts may be processed together for batch efficiency
- Extracted memories are deduplicated using content hashes and occurred_at timestamps
