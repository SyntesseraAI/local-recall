The MCP server includes a background daemon that automatically:
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache directory
- Processes transcripts to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts using content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
- Runs continuously every 5 minutes

This daemon is critical for the memory extraction feature. It allows memories to be created asynchronously without blocking the user's coding session. The Stop hook is currently disabled in favor of this async daemon approach.
