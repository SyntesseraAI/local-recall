The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API (via `@anthropic-ai/sdk`) with streaming enabled to extract memories from condensed transcripts. The system condenses transcripts using `transcript-condenser.ts` before processing to reduce token usage. Uses the Haiku model for fast, cost-effective extraction. The extractor streams responses and aggregates them into complete memory objects.
