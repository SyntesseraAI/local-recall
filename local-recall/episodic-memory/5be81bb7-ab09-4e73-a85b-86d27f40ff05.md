The memory extractor module uses the Claude API (via `claude -p` command) to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. It processes condensed transcripts that contain User, Assistant, and Tool events, then uses a structured prompt system to guide Claude in identifying memories worth storing. The extracted memories include subject, keywords, scope (applies_to), and content.
