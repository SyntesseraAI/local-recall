When extracting memories from transcripts, the transcript should be condensed into high-level events before analysis. This reduces token usage and improves focus on extracting meaningful memories. The condensed format uses markers like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]` to represent session activities.
