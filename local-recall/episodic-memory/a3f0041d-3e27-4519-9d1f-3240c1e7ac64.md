The memory extraction system analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to identify and create memories that help future AI assistants. This process:

- Reads condensed transcripts from sessions
- Uses AI-powered analysis to extract valuable insights
- Creates structured memory files with metadata
- Stores memories in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory

The system is designed to capture architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, and user preferences discovered during development sessions.
