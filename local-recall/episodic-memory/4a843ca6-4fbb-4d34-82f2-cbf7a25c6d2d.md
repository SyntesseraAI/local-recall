The memory extraction process works with condensed transcript format that includes:
- `[User]` - User requests and questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations with their names
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome status of tool calls

This format is used by the memory-extractor to parse session transcripts and identify meaningful events to extract as memories.
