Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use. First startup may take 30-60 seconds while model downloads; subsequent runs load from cache.

If 'Tokenizer file not found' error occurs, the cache is corrupted/incomplete. Fix by removing `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and letting it re-download.
