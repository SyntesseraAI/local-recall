# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Naming Convention

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- All `/` characters are replaced with `-`
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts are stored in `~/.claude/projects/{path-with-dashes}/transcripts/`
- Each transcript is a `.jsonl` file containing the session conversation

This is important for the `transcript-collector.ts` module which needs to locate and process transcripts from the correct directory.
