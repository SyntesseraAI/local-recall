Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files. The system uses:

- **Core Components**: Memory manager for CRUD operations, vector store for semantic search (SQLite + fastembed), embedding service
- **Storage**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
- **Vector Search**: Uses BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) cached in `local_cache/`
- **Claude Integration**: SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks for context injection
- **MCP Server**: Exposes memory tools (create, get, search, list, rebuild index)
- **Memory Format**: YAML frontmatter with id, subject, keywords, applies_to scope, occurred_at timestamp, content_hash for deduplication
