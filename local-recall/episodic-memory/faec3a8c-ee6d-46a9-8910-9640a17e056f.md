Local Recall has three working hooks in VS Code: SessionStart hook loads recent memories on session start, UserPromptSubmit hook searches and injects relevant memories before processing user prompts, and Stop hook creates new memories from transcripts after sessions end. The system is fully operational and requires no fixes.
