# Condensed Transcript Format

When extracting memories from transcripts, the format uses event-based condensation:

- `[User]` - User questions or requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool operations

This condensed format makes it easier to identify key learning moments and discoveries during a session.
