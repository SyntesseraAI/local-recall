The MCP server is currently running from `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/mcp-server/server.js` with config at `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.mcp.json`. The main project root does not yet have a compiled `scripts/` directory - this suggests the plugin directory is a separate development setup.
