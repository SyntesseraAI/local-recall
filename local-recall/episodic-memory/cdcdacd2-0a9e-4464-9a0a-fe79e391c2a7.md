There are two key moments when memories are injected into Claude's context:
1. **Session Start**: The session-start hook loads the memory index and retrieves relevant memories based on the current context
2. **User Prompt Submit**: The user-prompt-submit hook extracts keywords from the user's prompt and searches for matching memories before Claude processes it

This dual-trigger approach ensures Claude has access to both session-level context and prompt-specific memories.
