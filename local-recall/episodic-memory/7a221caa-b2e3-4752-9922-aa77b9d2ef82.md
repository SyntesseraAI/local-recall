# Keyword Extraction Task

User demonstrated need for extracting keywords from semi-structured text (specifically the memory extraction context/instructions).

The task involved:
1. Parsing a large block of instructional text
2. Extracting relevant keywords
3. Returning only a JSON array of strings, no explanation

This indicates the memory extraction system may need to handle parsing of transcripts or instructions for keyword identification.
