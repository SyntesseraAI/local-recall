Three hooks integrate Local Recall with Claude Code: SessionStart (loads 5 most recent memories on session start), UserPromptSubmit (performs semantic search on user prompts), and Stop (disabled - memory extraction moved to MCP server daemon). Hooks receive JSON input with session_id, transcript_path, and cwd, outputting memories to stdout for injection into Claude's context.
