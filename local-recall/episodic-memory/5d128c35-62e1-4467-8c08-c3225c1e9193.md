The memory extraction prompt in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts provides Claude with detailed instructions for extracting memories from transcripts. The prompt:

- Explains the memory file format with YAML frontmatter and structured fields
- Specifies what makes a good memory (atomic, specific, actionable)
- Defines the scope field options: global, file:<path>, area:<name>
- Lists what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns) and what to skip
- Returns memories as JSON with subject, keywords, applies_to, and content fields
- Guides keyword selection to be specific and searchable

This structured approach ensures consistent, high-quality memory extraction across different transcripts.
