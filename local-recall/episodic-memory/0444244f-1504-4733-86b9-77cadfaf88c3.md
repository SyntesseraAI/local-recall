The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku model via `claude -p` command to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. The system uses structured prompts defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide the model's output format, ensuring consistent and parseable JSON results. This approach balances accuracy with cost-effectiveness for processing session transcripts.
