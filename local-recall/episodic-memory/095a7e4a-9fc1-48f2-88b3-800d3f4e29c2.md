The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. It uses a structured prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides Claude to identify:

1. What was learned during the session
2. What is now known about the codebase
3. Codebase-specific patterns and conventions
4. Problems that were solved and their solutions

The extraction process is designed to create memories that help future AI assistants working on the codebase by avoiding mistakes and improving efficiency.
