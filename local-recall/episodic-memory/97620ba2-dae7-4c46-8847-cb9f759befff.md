The `local-recall/.gitignore` file is a tracked git file (not ignored). It specifies what files are ignored within the local-recall directory:
- `index.json` (auto-generated keyword index cache)
- `recall.log` (debug log file)

These auto-generated files should never be committed, while memory files in `episodic-memory/` directory should be tracked. The `.gitignore` file itself must always exist and be version-controlled so that when the repository is cloned, the proper ignore rules are in place.
