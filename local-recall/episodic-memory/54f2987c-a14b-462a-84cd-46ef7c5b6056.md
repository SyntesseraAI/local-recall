Memory files use `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp) and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix, 16 chars) for deduplication. The `findDuplicate()` function checks for existing memories with the same timestamp and hash before creating new ones. This prevents duplicate memories from being created when the same event is processed multiple times.
