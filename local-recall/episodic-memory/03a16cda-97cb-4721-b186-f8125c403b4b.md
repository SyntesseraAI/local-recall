# JSONL Transcript Format

Claude's transcript files are stored in JSONL format (JSON Lines), where each line is a complete JSON object.

## Processing Requirements

When reading transcript files:
1. Read file line-by-line
2. Parse each line as a separate JSON object (don't parse the entire file as one JSON)
3. Each line represents a single event in the transcript
4. Process events sequentially to build context

## Key Insight

This is different from a single large JSON array - it's a streaming format where each event is independent and can be processed incrementally. This is important for:
- Memory extraction efficiency (can process events as they come)
- Handling large transcripts without loading everything into memory
- Change detection (only need to process new lines since last read)
