The project includes a comprehensive memory extraction system that analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to automatically capture valuable insights. This system identifies:
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences and important component relationships

The extraction process is guided by specific rules about what to extract (architectural patterns, bug fixes, project-specific knowledge) versus what to ignore (generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, trivial information).
