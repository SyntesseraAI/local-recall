# Transcript File Discovery Strategy

When implementing transcript-collector functionality, the approach used:

1. **Location Research**: First examined where Claude stores transcripts by looking at the actual file system
2. **Path Verification**: Used `ls` and `cat` commands to verify the exact path format and file contents
3. **Manual Inspection**: Read sample JSONL files to understand the structure before writing code
4. **Progressive Implementation**: Started with basic file discovery and parsing before adding filtering/processing

## Key Discovery Methods

- `ls ~/.claude/projects/` to see available project folders
- `ls ~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/` to find transcript files
- `cat <transcript-file>` to inspect the JSONL format

## Testing Approach

When writing code that interacts with Claude's file system:
1. Don't assume the path structure - verify it empirically
2. Test with actual files from `~/.claude/projects/`
3. Handle both existing and missing transcript directories gracefully
4. Log the discovered paths for debugging

This approach revealed the dash-replacing naming convention that would not be obvious from documentation.
