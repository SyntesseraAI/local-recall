# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes and periods replaced with underscores:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with the pattern `transcript_*.jsonl`:
- Each line is a JSON object representing a session event
- Events include user messages, assistant responses, and tool calls
- Useful for extracting memories about what was discussed and solved

## Relevance to Local Recall

The transcript-collector component should scan this location to find and process transcripts for memory extraction. The path calculation involves:
1. Getting the absolute working directory
2. Replacing `/` with `_` and `.` with `_`
3. Constructing the full path to transcripts directory
