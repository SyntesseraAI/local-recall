The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001) to analyze transcripts and extract structured memories. The extraction uses a prompt template defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides the model to extract memories with specific fields: subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content. The MemoryExtractor class in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` orchestrates this process.
