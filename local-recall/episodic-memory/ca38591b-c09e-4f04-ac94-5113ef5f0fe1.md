The `TranscriptCollector` condenses transcripts before sending them to Claude for memory extraction. This reduces token usage by summarizing tool results and compacting the transcript structure. Tool results are summarized with status and key information rather than full output, making the transcript more concise while preserving essential information for memory extraction.
