The project maintains version consistency across two files that must be kept in sync:
1. `package.json` - Main package version
2. `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Plugin manifest version

When bumping versions, both files must be updated together. The plugin is located in `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/` subdirectory.
