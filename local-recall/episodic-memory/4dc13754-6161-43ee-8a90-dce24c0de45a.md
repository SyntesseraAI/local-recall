The LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL system is used to extract valuable memories from Claude Code session transcripts. The process involves:

1. Analyzing transcripts for learned knowledge, discovered facts, and solved problems
2. Extracting keywords that describe the memory
3. Assigning appropriate scope (global, file-specific, or area-specific)
4. Creating structured memories that help future assistants

Memories should be specific, actionable, and focused on single concepts. Generic programming knowledge should not be extracted as Claude already has this baseline knowledge.
