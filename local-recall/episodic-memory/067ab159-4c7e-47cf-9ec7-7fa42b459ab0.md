# Memory Extraction Process for Local Recall

When analyzing Claude Code session transcripts to extract memories:

## Key Requirements

1. **Output Format**: Return ONLY valid JSON object with no explanation, markdown, or code blocks
2. **Memory Structure**: Each memory must include:
   - `subject`: Brief one-line description (max 200 chars)
   - `keywords`: Array of 1-10 searchable keywords (lowercase, specific)
   - `applies_to`: Scope string (`global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`)
   - `content`: Detailed memory content in markdown format

## Scope Guidelines

- `global`: Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>`: Specific to a particular file
- `area:<name>`: Related to a component or area

## What to Extract

**DO extract**:
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations

**DO NOT extract**:
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Empty Response

If no valuable memories can be extracted, return: `{ "memories": [] }`
