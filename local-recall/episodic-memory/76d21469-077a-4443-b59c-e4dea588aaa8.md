The MCP server in `src/mcp-server/server.ts` includes a background daemon that runs every 5 minutes to: 1) Sync transcripts from Claude's cache directory, 2) Process transcripts using the claude CLI with memory extraction prompts, 3) Track processed transcripts with content hashes to detect changes, 4) Delete and recreate memories when transcripts change. This asynchronous approach keeps the MCP server responsive while maintaining up-to-date memories.
