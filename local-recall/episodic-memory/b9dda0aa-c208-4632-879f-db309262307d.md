# Memory Extraction Guidelines

When extracting memories from transcripts, focus on information that will help future AI assistants work more efficiently:

## Extract These Types of Memories

- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations and optimizations

## Do NOT Extract

- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Key Principles

- Be specific: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- Be concise: Focus on one concept per memory
- Be actionable: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work efficiently
- Use appropriate scope: `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`
