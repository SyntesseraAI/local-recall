Local Recall's core value is extracting knowledge from Claude Code session transcripts to create persistent memories that help future AI assistants. The extraction process:

- Analyzes session transcripts to identify learned insights
- Creates structured memories with metadata (subject, keywords, scope)
- Uses fuzzy search for retrieval based on context
- Allows multiple AI sessions to build on previous knowledge
- Memories are version-controlled markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
