# Transcript JSONL Format

Claude Code transcripts are JSONL files where each line is a JSON object representing an event.

## Event Structure

Each line contains a complete JSON object with:
- `type`: Event type (e.g., "user", "assistant", "tool_call", "tool_result")
- `content`: Event content/message
- `timestamp`: ISO-8601 timestamp
- `metadata`: Additional event metadata (varies by event type)

## Common Event Types

- `"user"` - User message/prompt
- `"assistant"` - Assistant response
- `"tool_call"` - Tool invocation (with tool name and arguments)
- `"tool_result"` - Tool execution result

## Parsing Considerations

- Each line must be parsed separately as valid JSON
- Do not try to parse the entire file as a single JSON object
- Timestamps are in ISO-8601 format and can be used for deduplication
- Tool names and arguments are essential for understanding what happened in the session
