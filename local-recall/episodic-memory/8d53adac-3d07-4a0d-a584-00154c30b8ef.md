The codebase includes a transcript condensing feature that converts full Claude Code session transcripts into a standardized event format with [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], and [Result: OK/ERROR] events. This condensed format is used for more efficient memory extraction, reducing the amount of data sent to Claude Haiku for processing.
