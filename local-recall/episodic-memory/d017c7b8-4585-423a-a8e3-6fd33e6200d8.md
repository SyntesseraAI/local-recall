# Transcript JSONL Format

Claude Code transcripts are stored as JSONL files where each line is a JSON object representing a turn in the conversation.

## Common Fields in Transcript Objects

- `type`: The type of message (e.g., "user", "assistant")
- `text` or `content`: The actual message text
- `timestamp`: When the message was created
- `role`: Who sent the message ("user" or "assistant")

## Structure

A typical transcript interaction:
1. User message with `type: "user"` and their prompt
2. Assistant response with `type: "assistant"` and Claude's reply
3. Additional fields may include metadata about tool usage, errors, or special events

The transcript-collector daemon reads these JSONL files line-by-line to extract memories and monitor for changes using content hashes.
