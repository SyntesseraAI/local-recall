Memory scope determines where a memory applies in the codebase:

- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

Choosing the correct scope ensures memories are surfaced to relevant contexts and prevents over-applying specific findings to unrelated code.
