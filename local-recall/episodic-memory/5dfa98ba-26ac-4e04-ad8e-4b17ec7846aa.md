The `syncTranscripts()` method in transcript-collector.ts was updated to check if source transcripts are synthetic BEFORE copying them from Claude's cache. This prevents unnecessary I/O overhead from copying files that would just be deleted during cleanup. The flow is: 1) cleanupTranscripts() removes existing synthetic files, 2) For each new/modified transcript, checks isSyntheticFile() before copying, 3) Skips with debug log if synthetic. This optimization reduces disk I/O when syncing transcripts.
