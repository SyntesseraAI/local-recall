Claude Code stores session transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The project folder name is the URL-encoded absolute path of the project directory (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall` for `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`).

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) where each line is a JSON object representing a message event with:
- `role`: 'user' or 'assistant'
- `content`: The message text
- `timestamp`: ISO-8601 formatted timestamp
- `tool_use`: Optional tool invocation details for assistant messages

This information is crucial for the transcript-collector component which needs to locate and parse these transcripts to extract memories.
