The transcript-collector uses `import { promises as fs } from 'node:fs'` for asynchronous file system operations. This is the standard modern Node.js approach for handling files in TypeScript/async code. When working with file operations in this codebase, always use the fs.promises API rather than callbacks or synchronous operations.
