The memory extractor parses markdown memories with YAML frontmatter headers and converts them to JSON. Each memory gets a SHA-256 content hash (first 16 characters) for deduplication. Memory objects include: id (UUID), subject, keywords array, applies_to scope, occurred_at timestamp, and content_hash field. This structure matches the memory file format defined in CLAUDE.md.
