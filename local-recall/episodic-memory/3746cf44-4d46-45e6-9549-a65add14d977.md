Local Recall uses the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model via the fastembed library for semantic search. The model produces 384-dimensional embeddings and uses asymmetric embedding - passages (memories) are embedded differently than queries using passageEmbed() for documents and queryEmbed() for search queries. This asymmetric approach optimizes for the different use cases of indexing documents vs searching them.
