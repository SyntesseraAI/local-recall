The MCP server runs a background daemon that syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, processes them to extract memories, tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection, deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change, and runs every 5 minutes. This allows asynchronous memory extraction without blocking Claude Code operations.
