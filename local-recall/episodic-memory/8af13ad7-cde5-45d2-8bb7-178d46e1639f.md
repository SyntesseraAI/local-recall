The CLAUDE.md architecture tree had incorrect references:
- Showed `scripts/` folder for build output, but actual output goes to `dist/`
- Referenced non-existent `.claude-plugin/`, `hooks.json`, and `.mcp.json` files
- These were removed and paths corrected to reflect actual project structure with `dist/hooks/` and `dist/mcp-server/` as compiled outputs
