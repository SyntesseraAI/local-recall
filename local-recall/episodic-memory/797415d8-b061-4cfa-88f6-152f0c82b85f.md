# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the project's transcripts directory. Each line is a JSON object representing an event in the session.

## Key Implications

- Transcripts are located outside the project directory
- Path conversion uses dash (`-`) as separator for directory components
- This path format is consistent and predictable
- Transcript collector needs to reconstruct this path given a working directory
