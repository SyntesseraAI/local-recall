Data enters the SQLite vector store through three pathways:

1. **On Memory Creation (immediate)**: `MemoryManager.createMemory()` writes the memory to disk and immediately calls `vectorStore.add(memory)` to generate embedding and insert into database

2. **Startup Sync**: When hooks or tools start, `vectorStore.sync(memories)` is called to ensure the in-memory vector store matches the file-based memories

3. **MCP Server Daemon**: The background daemon processes new/modified transcripts and creates memories, which are then added to the vector store

The sync operation handles both adding new memories and removing deleted ones.
