# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files:
- One JSON object per line
- Each object represents an event (user message, assistant response, tool use, etc.)
- Files are updated continuously during the session
- Content-hashing helps identify when transcripts change between sessions

This discovery is important for the transcript-collector component which needs to locate and process these files.
