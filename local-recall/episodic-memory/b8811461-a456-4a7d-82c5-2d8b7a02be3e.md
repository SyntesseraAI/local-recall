Claude stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The project folder naming convention encodes the absolute path by replacing `/` with `-`: `/Users/joe/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/` corresponds to the project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`. Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory within each project folder. This is important for the MCP server daemon which syncs transcripts every 5 minutes to extract memories.
