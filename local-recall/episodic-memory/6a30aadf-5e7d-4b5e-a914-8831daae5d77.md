The memory extraction prompt is stored in a dedicated file (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) rather than being inline in the memory-extractor code. This separation of concerns:

- Makes it easier to iterate on and improve the extraction prompt
- Keeps the prompt logic separate from the implementation logic
- Allows the prompt to be versioned and tested independently
- Enables different extraction strategies without modifying the core extractor
- Improves code maintainability and readability

This pattern should be followed for other prompt-based functionality in the codebase.
