# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

## Problem

Raw transcripts can grow very large over long sessions, making them expensive to process for memory extraction.

## Solution

Transcript condensing compresses the transcript by:
1. Replacing verbose tool outputs with compact summaries
2. Removing duplicate or redundant information
3. Keeping only the essence of each interaction

## Results

- Achieves approximately 90% reduction in file size
- Maintains enough context for memory extraction
- Makes processing faster and cheaper with Claude API

## Implementation Considerations

- Must preserve critical information (tool names, results, errors)
- Tool output handling is delicate - different tools need different approaches:
  - Some tools (like grep results) can be heavily condensed
  - Others (like tool errors) must be preserved in full
- Need to balance compression with information retention
- Condensed transcripts should still allow extraction of meaningful memories

## Usage in Memory Extraction

The MCP server daemon uses condensed transcripts when:
1. Processing transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes
2. Sending to Claude Haiku for memory extraction
3. Tracking transcript changes for deduplication
