# Claude Project Transcripts Location and Naming

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS. The project folder name uses the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes.

## Path Format Examples

- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

This naming convention is consistent and predictable, allowing transcript-collector to reliably locate transcripts for any project based on its working directory.
