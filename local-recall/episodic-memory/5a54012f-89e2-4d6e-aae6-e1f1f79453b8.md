# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

When extracting memories from Claude Code session transcripts, the full transcript should be condensed first to reduce token usage and improve processing efficiency.

## Why Condense
- Transcripts can be very long and contain repetitive exchanges
- Condensing reduces token usage when processing with Claude Haiku
- Maintains the essential information needed for memory extraction
- Improves performance of the background MCP daemon

## Implementation
The transcript-collector component should condense transcripts into a format like:
- `[User]` - User requests and questions
- `[Assistant]` - Key Claude responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool outcomes

This condensed format preserves context while minimizing size.
