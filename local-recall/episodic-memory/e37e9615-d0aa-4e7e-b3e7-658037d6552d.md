# Search Capabilities in Local Recall

Local Recall supports multiple search approaches for finding relevant memories:

## Embedding-Based Search (Semantic)

- Uses `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model
- Model size: ~133MB
- Automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use
- Provides semantic/meaning-based search across memory content
- First run takes 30-60 seconds while downloading model
- Subsequent runs load from cache

## Keyword-Based Search (Lexical)

- Fuzzy matching on memory keywords field
- Fast, no external dependencies
- Configurable fuzzy threshold (default 0.6)
- Built into core search module

## When to Use Each

- **Keywords**: Fast, good for exact/partial matches, works offline
- **Embeddings**: More semantically accurate, captures meaning variations, heavier initial setup

## Implementation Notes

- Both search methods are implemented in `src/core/search.ts`
- Embedding model is stored in `src/core/embedding.ts`
- Vector store implementation in `src/core/vector-store.ts`
- Configuration supports threshold tuning for better recall/precision balance
