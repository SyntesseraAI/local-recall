Local Recall uses the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model via the fastembed library:

- Model size: ~133MB
- Automatic download on first use
- Cached in `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`
- First run takes 30-60 seconds (one-time cost)
- Subsequent runs load from cache

**Troubleshooting**: If you see "Tokenizer file not found" error, the cache is corrupted. Remove `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and it will re-download on next run.
