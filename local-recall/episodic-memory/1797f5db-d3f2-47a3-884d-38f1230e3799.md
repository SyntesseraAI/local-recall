When creating memories, use appropriate scope:
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to component/area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

Choosing the correct scope makes memories discoverable and prevents overgeneralization of specific knowledge.
