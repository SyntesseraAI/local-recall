Local Recall integrates with Claude Code via three hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json`: SessionStart (loads recent memories), UserPromptSubmit (semantic search on prompt), and Stop (extract memories from transcript). Hooks are shell commands that receive JSON via stdin and output JSON. Command paths depend on whether local-recall is installed as npm package or run from project directory.
