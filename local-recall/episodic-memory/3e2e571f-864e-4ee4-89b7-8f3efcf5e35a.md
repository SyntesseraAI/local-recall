Before sending transcripts to Claude Haiku for memory extraction, the system condenses the transcript into a structured event format with `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, and `[Tool: Name]` entries. This reduces token usage and improves processing efficiency while maintaining the essential information needed for memory generation.
