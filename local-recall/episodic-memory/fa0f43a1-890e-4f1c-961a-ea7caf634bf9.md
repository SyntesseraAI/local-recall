# Project Build and Development Scripts

## Available Scripts

From `package.json`:
- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript and bundle scripts
- `npm run dev` - Watch mode for development
- `npm run test` - Run test suite
- `npm run lint` - Lint code
- `npm run mcp:start` - Start MCP server

## Build Process

The project uses TypeScript compilation with bundling for:
- Hook scripts in `scripts/hooks/`
- MCP server in `scripts/mcp-server/`

## Key Directories

- Source: `src/`
- Build output: `dist/`
- Bundled scripts: `scripts/` (gitignored, generated)

## Development Workflow

Use `npm run build` after TypeScript changes, or `npm run dev` for watch mode during development.
