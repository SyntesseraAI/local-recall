The MCP server runs a background daemon that:
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/)
- Processes transcripts using claude -p to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
- Runs every 5 minutes

This handles memory extraction asynchronously, avoiding the need for a disabled Stop hook.
