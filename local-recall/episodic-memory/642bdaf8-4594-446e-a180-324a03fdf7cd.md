# Stale Build Artifact: IndexManager Class

## Finding
The file `dist/core/index.js` (dated Dec 1st) contains an `IndexManager` class that:
- Reads markdown files from disk
- Is never imported or used anywhere in the current codebase
- Exists alongside newer code that uses JSONL stores

## Status
- Not imported in any source file
- Not referenced in MCP server or hooks
- Can be safely removed as a cleanup step
- Indicates incomplete migration or failed build cleanup

## Implication
This file wasn't causing the markdown creation issue (it's unused), but it demonstrates that stale artifacts from the migration process remain in the build output.
