Extraction prompts are centralized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` rather than hardcoded in the extractor. This separation allows for easier maintenance and iteration on the extraction logic without modifying the core extractor implementation. The prompts define what Claude should look for when analyzing transcripts to identify valuable memories.
