The memory extraction prompts in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` are carefully designed to guide Claude's API in identifying valuable memories from transcripts. The prompts instruct Claude to extract three main types of memories: (1) architectural decisions and their reasoning, (2) bug fixes and root cause analysis, and (3) code patterns or conventions specific to the project. The prompts also specify what NOT to extract (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data) and provide guidelines for memory scope (global, file-specific, area-specific).
