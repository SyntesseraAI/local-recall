The memory extraction system analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to identify valuable learning moments. Transcripts contain a sequence of events including user requests, assistant responses, tool invocations, and their outcomes. The extraction system processes this data to identify architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and project-specific knowledge that should be retained for future sessions.
