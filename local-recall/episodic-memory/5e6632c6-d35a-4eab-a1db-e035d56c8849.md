# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Structure

Each Claude Code project has a folder under `~/.claude/projects/` where the folder name is derived from the project path:
- Project path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (JSON Lines - one JSON object per line) with the naming pattern `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jsonl`.

## Transcript Structure

Each line in a transcript JSONL file is a JSON object containing:
- Event type (`type` field)
- Event data (varies by type)
- Timestamps

Common event types include:
- User prompts
- Assistant responses
- Tool invocations and results

## Usage in local-recall

The MCP server daemon uses `transcript-collector.ts` to:
1. Scan the transcripts directory
2. Read and parse JSONL transcript files
3. Extract memories based on transcript content
4. Track processed transcripts to avoid reprocessing
