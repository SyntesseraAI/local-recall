Each memory should include:
- `id`: Unique UUID identifier
- `subject`: Brief one-line description (max 200 chars)
- `keywords`: Array of 1-10 searchable keywords (lowercase, specific)
- `applies_to`: Scope string (global, file:<path>, or area:<name>)
- `occurred_at`: ISO-8601 timestamp of when the original event occurred
- `content_hash`: SHA-256 hash prefix (16 chars) of content for deduplication
- `content`: Detailed markdown-formatted memory content

The `occurred_at` and `content_hash` fields are critical for the memory system's deduplication logic - they allow detecting and preventing duplicate memories when the same insight is rediscovered.
