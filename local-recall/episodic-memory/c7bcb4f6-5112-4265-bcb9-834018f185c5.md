# Transcript Condensing Strategy

Transcript condensing is a technique to reduce transcript file size while maintaining information relevant for memory extraction.

## What Gets Condensed

When processing transcripts:
- **Preserved**: User prompts, assistant responses, tool invocations (names), and results
- **Removed**: Verbose tool output, full command results, and redundant formatting
- **Format**: Events are summarized as:
  - `[User] <prompt summary>`
  - `[Assistant] <response summary>`
  - `[Tool: ToolName] <tool invocation>`
  - `[Result: OK/ERROR]`

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Size**: Condensed transcripts are significantly smaller than raw transcripts
2. **Faster Processing**: Quicker to transmit and process for memory extraction
3. **Preserved Context**: Enough information remains to understand what happened and why
4. **Better Integration**: Works well with claude's prompt processing for memory extraction

## Implementation Notes

- Condensing should happen before sending transcripts to Claude for memory extraction
- The process is lossy but information-preserving for the purposes of memory creation
- Consider implementing as a utility function in `src/utils/transcript.ts`
