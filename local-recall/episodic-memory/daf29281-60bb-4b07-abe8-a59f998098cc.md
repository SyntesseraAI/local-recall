Development requirements: all new features must have unit tests in `tests/unit/` and integration tests in `tests/integration/`; documentation must be placed in `docs/` folder and updated when modifying functionality; tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases; memory files should have relevant, specific keywords and careful scope selection (global vs file: vs area:).
