Memory extraction is handled asynchronously by the MCP server daemon rather than through the Stop hook. The daemon processes transcripts every 5 minutes, extracting memories from Claude Code session transcripts stored in `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`. This design prevents blocking the Claude Code UI during memory extraction and allows for batch processing of multiple transcripts.
