Memory extraction logic is separated into a dedicated prompts module. This file contains:
- The system prompt that instructs Claude on memory extraction
- Rules for what constitutes a valuable memory
- Format specifications for the JSON output
- Guidelines for scope determination (global, file:path, area:name)

This separation allows:
- Easy iteration on extraction quality without modifying core logic
- Clear documentation of extraction rules and expectations
- Potential A/B testing of different extraction strategies
- Centralized maintenance of the extraction system prompt
