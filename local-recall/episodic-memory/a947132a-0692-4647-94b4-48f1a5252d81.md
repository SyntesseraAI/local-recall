The local-recall system extracts memories from Claude Code session transcripts as part of its learning mechanism. This allows the system to capture insights and discoveries from coding sessions and make them available for future sessions. The memory-extractor module is responsible for analyzing transcripts and producing structured memories that can be stored in the episodic-memory directory and indexed for later retrieval.
