# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with forward slashes, but with special encoding:
- Forward slashes `/` are converted to underscores `_`
- The leading slash is also converted to underscore

### Example

For a project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`:
- The folder name would be `_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`
- Transcripts are stored at `~/.claude/projects/_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with `.jsonl` extension.

## Key Implementation Detail

When implementing transcript collection, convert the project's absolute path (`process.cwd()`) by:
1. Splitting on `/`
2. Joining with `_`
3. This creates the encoded project folder name to look up in `~/.claude/projects/`
