Memory extraction prompt templates are centralized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This separation of concerns keeps prompt engineering isolated from the core extraction logic in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts`, making it easier to iterate on extraction quality and guidelines without modifying the extraction engine itself.
