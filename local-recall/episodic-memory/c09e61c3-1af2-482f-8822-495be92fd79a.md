Each memory must specify its scope via `applies_to`:
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to component/area (e.g., `area:authentication`)

Proper scoping ensures memories are retrieved only when relevant to the current context and helps future assistants understand where specific knowledge applies.
