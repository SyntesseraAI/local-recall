Two new TypeScript modules were added to the core memory system:

1. `src/core/embedding.ts` - Handles embedding generation using fastembed with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model
2. `src/core/vector-store.ts` - Manages storage and retrieval of vector embeddings for semantic search

These modules integrate with the existing memory system to enable semantic similarity-based memory retrieval in addition to the existing keyword-based search. The vector store persists embeddings to disk for efficient retrieval across sessions.
