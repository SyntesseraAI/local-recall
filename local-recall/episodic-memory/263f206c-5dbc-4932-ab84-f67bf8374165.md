# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The `transcript-collector.ts` module implements transcript condensing to prepare session transcripts for memory extraction.

## Current Implementation Status

- Transcript condensing feature has been implemented in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`
- Uses Claude Haiku API to compress transcripts while preserving key information
- Condensed format makes it easier for memory extraction to identify important events

## Condensing Process

The condensing process:
1. Reads raw JSONL transcript files
2. Processes them through Claude Haiku with specific prompts
3. Extracts condensed event format (User/Assistant/Tool entries)
4. Outputs structured format for memory extraction

## Integration with Memory System

- Condensed transcripts serve as intermediate format between raw sessions and memory creation
- Reduces token usage and processing time for memory extraction
- Helps identify relevant events and context for memory creation
- Part of the async background processing pipeline
