When the bundled plugin server is fixed, bump both `package.json` version and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version to force a fresh deployment. Users must uninstall the old plugin version and reinstall to get the updated bundled code from the new cache location. The version number triggers a new cache directory creation (e.g., 0.1.0 → 0.1.1 changes the deployment path).
