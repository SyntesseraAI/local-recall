# Code Quality Preferences

The user emphasizes keeping code simple and focused:

## Principles
- Avoid premature abstractions (three similar lines don't need a helper)
- Don't add features beyond what was asked
- Don't add extra error handling for impossible scenarios
- Trust internal code and framework guarantees
- Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
- Delete unused code completely instead of marking with comments
- Don't create utilities for one-time operations
- Don't design for hypothetical future requirements

## Application
- When fixing bugs, don't clean up surrounding code
- When adding simple features, don't add extra configurability
- No feature flags or backwards-compatibility shims unless necessary
- The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task

This is especially important when working with the local-recall codebase.
