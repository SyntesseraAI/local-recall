The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model via the `claude` CLI with `-p` flag for prompt input. It processes transcripts to generate both keywords and structured memories. The extraction is controlled via prompts defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This allows for semantic understanding of session content to create meaningful memories without requiring custom parsing logic.
