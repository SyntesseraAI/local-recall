When using condensed transcript format for memory extraction, the system prepends `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` context containing:
- Project context (working directory)
- Transcript format explanation
- Memory extraction guidelines
- Previous transcript content

This context must be filtered out from the actual memory extraction analysis to avoid processing metadata as session content.
