# Keyword Extraction Request

The user is testing or implementing a keyword extraction feature that analyzes session transcripts to identify relevant keywords for memory extraction.

## Context

This appears to be part of the memory extraction pipeline where:
1. Session transcripts are analyzed
2. Keywords are extracted from the transcript content
3. These keywords are used to create or tag memories

## Implementation Notes

The extraction should return a JSON array of keyword strings. This is likely used by the local-recall system to improve searchability and categorization of memories.
