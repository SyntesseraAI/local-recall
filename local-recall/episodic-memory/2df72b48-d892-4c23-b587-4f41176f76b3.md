Transcripts are condensed before being sent to the memory extraction API. This pre-processing step:
- Reduces the token count needed for memory extraction
- Makes the extraction process more efficient and cost-effective
- Is performed in the `transcript-collector.ts` module
- Uses a standardized condensing format for consistency
