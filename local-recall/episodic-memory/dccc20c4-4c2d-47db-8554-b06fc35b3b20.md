The MCP server includes a background daemon that:
- Syncs transcripts from Claude cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
- Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
- Runs asynchronously every 5 minutes

This approach avoids blocking the Stop hook while ensuring transcripts are processed for memory extraction. The daemon is essential for maintaining up-to-date memories across sessions.
