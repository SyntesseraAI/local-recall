The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku model to analyze session transcripts and identify valuable memories. The process:

1. Uses a specialized system prompt stored in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`
2. Sends condensed transcript events to Claude for analysis
3. Claude returns structured JSON with memory objects
4. Each memory has: subject (max 200 chars), keywords array (1-10 items), applies_to scope, and markdown content

The extraction focuses on architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and configuration quirks specific to the codebase. It explicitly excludes generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and sensitive data.
