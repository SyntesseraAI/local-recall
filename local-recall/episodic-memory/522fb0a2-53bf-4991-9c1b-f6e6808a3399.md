The memory extraction process follows a specific workflow: 1) Transcripts are read and parsed, 2) Claude Haiku analyzes the content via MCP call_tool, 3) Extracted memories are created using the memory_create tool. This runs in the background daemon which processes transcripts every 5 minutes and tracks processed transcripts by content hash to avoid reprocessing.
