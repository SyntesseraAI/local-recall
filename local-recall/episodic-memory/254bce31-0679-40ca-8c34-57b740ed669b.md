Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions. All memories are stored locally within the repository as markdown files with YAML frontmatter, making them version-controllable and shareable.

Key components:
- Memory files stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` (version-controlled)
- SQLite + vector embeddings for semantic search in `local-recall/memory.sqlite` (gitignored)
- Claude Code hooks for session start and user prompt submission
- MCP server for tool exposure

The system follows a plugin architecture with bundled scripts and source TypeScript files.
