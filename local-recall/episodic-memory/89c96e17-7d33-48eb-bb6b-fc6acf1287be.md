Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files. It uses SQLite with vector embeddings (fastembed BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic search. Memories are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory and are version-controlled.
