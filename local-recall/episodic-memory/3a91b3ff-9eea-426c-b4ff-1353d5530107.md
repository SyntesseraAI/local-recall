# Transcript Analysis for Memory Extraction

When analyzing Claude Code session transcripts for memory extraction, the system uses special `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` markers to identify sections requiring analysis. The transcript is condensed into events:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool calls

This structured format helps identify what was learned, problems solved, and codebase-specific knowledge that should be preserved as memories.
