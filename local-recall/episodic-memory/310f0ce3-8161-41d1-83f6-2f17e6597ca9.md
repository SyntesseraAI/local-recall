The memory extraction system in memory-extractor.ts uses transcript condensing before sending to Claude Haiku for memory extraction. This is a token optimization strategy that reduces the input size while preserving important information about what occurred in the session.

The condensing process is handled by the transcript-collector module and reduces verbosity while maintaining semantic meaning of the transcript events.
