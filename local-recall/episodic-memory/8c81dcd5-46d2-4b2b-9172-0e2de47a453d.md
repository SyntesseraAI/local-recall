When bumping the plugin version, updates must be coordinated across two files:
1. package.json - main package version
2. dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json - plugin manifest version

Keep both in sync to maintain version consistency across the published npm package and the plugin marketplace distribution.
