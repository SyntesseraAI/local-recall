Transcripts are condensed into standard event formats before memory extraction:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses or explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool calls

This standardized format makes it easier for the memory extraction prompt to parse and understand session activities.
