The memory-extraction.ts file contains prompt templates that instruct Claude on how to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. These prompts define what constitutes a good memory (specific, actionable, scoped appropriately) and guide the extraction process to focus on architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and important discoveries rather than generic knowledge.
