The search implementation supports multiple approaches: 1) Fuzzy keyword matching for quick lookups, 2) Embedding-based semantic search using the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for deeper understanding. The embedding model is approximately 133MB and is cached locally. The search should support both approaches to provide comprehensive memory retrieval.
