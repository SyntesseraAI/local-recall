# Transcript Condensing

## Purpose

Transcript condensing creates a compact, token-efficient representation of conversations by:
- Removing redundant information
- Extracting key events and decisions
- Creating summaries of important exchanges

## Implementation

Implemented in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` with extractors that:
1. Parse JSONL transcripts
2. Identify key events (user requests, tool invocations, decisions)
3. Create condensed representations for memory storage

## Why It Matters

Condensed transcripts:
- Reduce storage size
- Improve search performance
- Focus on actionable information
- Make memories more relevant to future sessions

## Usage

Condensing happens automatically during memory extraction via the `TranscriptCollector` which processes Claude Code session transcripts.
