The MCP server includes a background daemon that runs every 5 minutes to:
1. Sync transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
2. Process transcripts to extract memories using claude -p
3. Track processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
4. Delete and recreate memories when transcripts change
5. Expose memory tools via MCP protocol

This asynchronous approach avoids blocking the Stop hook and provides better performance. See `src/mcp-server/server.ts` for implementation.
