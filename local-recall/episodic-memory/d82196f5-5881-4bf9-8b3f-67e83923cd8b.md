The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku with a structured prompt system to extract keywords and memories from transcript condensing. The process includes:

1. **Keyword Extraction**: Uses Claude Haiku to extract relevant keywords from the transcript
2. **Memory Generation**: Generates structured memory objects with subject, keywords, and content
3. **Prompt-based Approach**: Utilizes prompts from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` for consistent output
4. **Tool Integration**: Works with the memory system to create memories with proper scoping (global/file/area)

This approach ensures memories are consistent, well-organized, and semantically relevant to the codebase context.
