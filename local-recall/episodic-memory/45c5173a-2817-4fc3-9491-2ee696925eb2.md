Memory extraction classifies memories into three scope categories:
- `global`: Applies to the entire codebase (architecture, conventions)
- `file:<path>`: Specific to a particular file
- `area:<name>`: Related to a component or feature area

This classification helps memories be properly scoped and searchable by context.
