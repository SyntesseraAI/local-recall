The default logging level in `getMinLogLevel()` was changed from 'info' to 'error' to minimize log noise in production. Users can still override this by setting the `LOCAL_RECALL_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to 'debug', 'info', or 'warn' as needed. This change reduces unnecessary log output while maintaining the ability to enable debugging when required.
