The memory extraction prompt at `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` provides specific guidelines for what Claude should extract from transcripts. It emphasizes extracting architectural decisions, bug fixes with root cause analysis, code patterns specific to the project, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, and performance considerations. It explicitly excludes generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, sensitive data, and outdated information.
