The memory extraction process has specific guidelines for what to extract and what to skip:

**DO Extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations or optimizations

**DO NOT Extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

This focused approach ensures memories are actionable and remain relevant long-term.
