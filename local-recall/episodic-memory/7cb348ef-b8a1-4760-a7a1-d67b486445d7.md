The default fuzzy match threshold is 0.6 (60% match required). This can be configured via environment variables or `.local-recall.json` file under the `fuzzyThreshold` option. Higher threshold = stricter matching, lower threshold = more lenient results. Consider adjusting based on whether you want precision or recall in search results.
