# Memory Extraction Process

When analyzing Claude Code session transcripts for memory extraction, the transcript is provided in a condensed format with `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` markers.

## Transcript Format

The condensed transcript uses these event markers:
- `[User]` - User's request or query
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's response or explanation
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocation (e.g., `[Tool: Read]`, `[Tool: Bash]`)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of the tool invocation

## Purpose

The `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` marker indicates that the analysis is happening in the memory extraction phase. This helps identify that:
1. The transcript being analyzed is from the current session
2. Memories should be extracted from what just happened
3. This is not a previously processed or external transcript

This structure helps the memory extraction system identify what was learned, problems solved, and codebase-specific knowledge during the session.
