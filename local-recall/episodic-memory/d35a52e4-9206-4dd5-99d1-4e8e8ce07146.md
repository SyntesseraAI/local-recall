The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to intelligently extract memories from session transcripts. It employs structured prompts defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to ensure consistent memory format (YAML frontmatter + markdown content). The system processes transcript events and generates memories with proper metadata including keywords, scope, and content hashes for deduplication.
