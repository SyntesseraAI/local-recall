# Embedding Model Caching

Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search.

## Download and Cache Behavior

- Model is automatically downloaded on first startup (~133MB)
- Downloaded to `local_cache/` directory for persistent caching
- First run takes 30-60 seconds while model downloads
- Subsequent runs load from cache (much faster)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter "Tokenizer file not found" errors:
1. The cache is corrupted or incomplete (usually from interrupted download)
2. Remove the corrupted cache: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*`
3. Model will re-download automatically on next run
