The memory extraction prompt template is maintained in a separate file (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) rather than being hardcoded into the memory-extractor module. This separation of concerns allows:
- Easier modification of extraction logic without touching the core extractor code
- Reusability of the prompt across different components
- Clear isolation of prompt engineering from implementation logic
- Better testability of prompt variations
