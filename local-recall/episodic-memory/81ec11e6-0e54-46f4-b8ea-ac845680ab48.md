The memory extraction system uses a structured prompt template defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts that is passed to Claude Haiku for analyzing transcripts. The memory-extractor.ts file (478 lines) handles the core logic for extracting memories from transcripts. The extraction uses a well-defined prompt system to guide Claude Haiku in identifying valuable memories from session transcripts.
