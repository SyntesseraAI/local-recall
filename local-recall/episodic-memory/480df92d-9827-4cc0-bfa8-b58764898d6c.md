# Stop Hook Disabled

## Current State

The Stop hook is currently disabled. Memory extraction is handled by the MCP server daemon which processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes.

## Reason

The daemon approach is more efficient and scalable than extracting memories on every session stop. It allows:
- Batch processing of multiple transcripts
- Change detection to avoid reprocessing unchanged transcripts
- Asynchronous operation without blocking user workflows

## Configuration Location

See `hooks.json` - the Stop hook event is commented out or marked as disabled.

## Future Considerations

If implementing memory extraction via the Stop hook in the future, this would be a breaking change from the current daemon-based architecture.
