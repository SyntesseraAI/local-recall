The MCP server runs a background daemon that syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, processes them to extract memories, tracks processed transcripts via content hashes, and deletes/recreates memories on transcript changes. This allows the Stop hook to remain lightweight while memory extraction happens asynchronously.
