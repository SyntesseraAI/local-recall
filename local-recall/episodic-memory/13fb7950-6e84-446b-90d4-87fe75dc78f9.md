The memory extraction system uses a separate prompt file to define extraction rules and guidelines. This separation allows for easy maintenance and iteration of extraction logic without modifying the core memory-extractor implementation. The prompt file should guide the extraction process to identify architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, and important relationships while avoiding generic knowledge and temporary debugging steps.
