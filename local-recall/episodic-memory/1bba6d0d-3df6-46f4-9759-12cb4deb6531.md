The configuration system (src/utils/config.ts) defines a `maxMemories` setting (default appears to be around 1000 based on CLAUDE.md). However, this limit is currently NOT actively enforced - there is no automatic pruning or cleanup when the limit is reached. The configuration value exists but is not actively used to constrain memory growth.
