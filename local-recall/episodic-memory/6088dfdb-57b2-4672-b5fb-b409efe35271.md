The MemoryManager class was creating the `local-recall/memories/` directory but not ensuring the parent `.gitignore` file existed. This caused the `.gitignore` file to never be created unless IndexManager.buildIndex() was called first.

Fix: Added a call to `ensureGitignore()` in the MemoryManager constructor to guarantee the `.gitignore` file is created whenever the memory directory is set up, regardless of whether the index is built.
