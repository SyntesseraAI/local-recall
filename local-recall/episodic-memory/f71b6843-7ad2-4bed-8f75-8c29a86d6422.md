# Model Selection for Memory Extraction

When implementing transcript analysis for memory extraction, use `claude-sonnet-4-5` instead of `claude-haiku-4-5`.

## Rationale

- **Haiku**: Sufficient for simple keyword extraction from short prompts, but struggles with complex reasoning
- **Sonnet**: Better handles intricate relationships between concepts, architectural patterns, and nuanced technical discussions
- **Trade-off**: Sonnet is slower and more expensive, but produces higher-quality memories for long or complex transcripts

For transcripts that are:
- Long (>50 events)
- Contain complex architectural discussions
- Involve debugging and root-cause analysis
- Have multiple interconnected changes

Use Sonnet to capture the full depth of learning.
