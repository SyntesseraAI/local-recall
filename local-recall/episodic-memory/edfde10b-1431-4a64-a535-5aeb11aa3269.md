The local-recall/recall.log file tracks hook execution and can be used to debug memory creation issues. The log shows:
- SessionStart hook fired ✓
- UserPromptSubmit hook fired ✓
- Stop hook entries (or lack thereof) indicate if memory creation was attempted

This log is created by src/utils/logger.ts and is gitignored in .local-recall/.gitignore. Checking this log is the first step in diagnosing memory creation failures.
