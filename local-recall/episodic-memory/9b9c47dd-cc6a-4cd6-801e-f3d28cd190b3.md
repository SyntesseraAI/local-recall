Memory extraction is a central feature of Local Recall that transforms raw Claude Code session transcripts into structured, searchable memories. The `memory-extractor.ts` module orchestrates this process by: 1) Parsing transcripts into events, 2) Using Claude Haiku to extract meaningful keywords, 3) Generating memory content, 4) Creating memory files with proper YAML frontmatter and markdown formatting. This enables the system to build a knowledge base that improves over time.
