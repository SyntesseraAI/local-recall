Haiku model is well-suited for structured extraction tasks like memory extraction from transcripts. It successfully:
- Extracts valid YAML frontmatter with proper structure
- Generates markdown-formatted memory content
- Produces output that is compatible with existing `stripMarkdownCodeBlocks` utilities
- Completes processing significantly faster than larger models

This makes Haiku a good default choice for memory extraction operations in Local Recall, especially where cost and speed are important factors in daemon operations.
