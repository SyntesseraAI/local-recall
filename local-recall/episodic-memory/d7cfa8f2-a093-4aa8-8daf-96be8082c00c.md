Local Recall integrates with Claude Code via:
1. **Hooks** (in hooks.json): SessionStart (loads recent memories), UserPromptSubmit (semantic search on user input), Stop (disabled)
2. **MCP Server**: Exposes memory tools (memory_create, memory_get, memory_search, memory_list, index_rebuild) for Claude Desktop and other MCP clients
3. **Background daemon**: Processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes to extract memories
4. Plugin root is at project root with scripts bundled in `scripts/` directory
