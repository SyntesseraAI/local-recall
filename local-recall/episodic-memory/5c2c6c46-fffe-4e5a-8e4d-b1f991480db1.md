The memory extraction pipeline uses a condensing step before extracting memories from transcripts. This is done to:
1. Reduce token usage by removing redundant or irrelevant parts of transcripts
2. Focus Claude's analysis on the most important parts
3. Improve the quality of extracted memories by removing noise

The `condenseTranscript` function handles this step as part of the extraction workflow.
