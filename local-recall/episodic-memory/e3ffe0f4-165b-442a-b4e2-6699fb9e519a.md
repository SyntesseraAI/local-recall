When extracting memories from transcripts:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data (keys, passwords)
- Quickly-outdated information

**Scope appropriately:**
- `global` - Entire codebase (architecture, conventions)
- `file:<path>` - Specific file quirks
- `area:<name>` - Component-specific patterns
