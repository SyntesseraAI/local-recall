The vector store implements semantic search using cosine distance similarity scoring:
- Score range: 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (identical)
- Scores are rounded to 2 decimal places
- Results sorted by score descending
- When scores are equal, more recent memories (occurred_at) are ranked first as a tie-breaker

This ensures both relevance and freshness in search results.
