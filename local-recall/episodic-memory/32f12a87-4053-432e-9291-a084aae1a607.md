The SessionStart hook:
1. Triggers when a Claude Code session begins
2. Loads all memories from disk via MemoryManager.listMemories()
3. Returns the 5 most recent memories (sorted by occurred_at)
4. Outputs memory content to stdout (injected into Claude's context)

Important: This is a full reload, not incremental. The vector store is NOT used here to avoid slow initialization on every session start.
