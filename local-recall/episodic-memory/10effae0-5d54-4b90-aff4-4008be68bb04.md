The memory extractor implements deduplication using two mechanisms: (1) SHA-256 content hashing of the memory content to detect identical memories, and (2) occurred_at timestamps to handle temporal context. The extractor checks if a memory with the same content hash already exists before creating a new memory, ensuring idempotency. This prevents duplicate memories from being created when transcripts are processed multiple times.
