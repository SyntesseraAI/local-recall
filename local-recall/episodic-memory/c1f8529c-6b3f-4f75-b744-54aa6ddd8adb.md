Three hooks are configured in hooks.json:
1. SessionStart: Loads 5 most recent memories on session start (doesn't use vector store to avoid slow initialization)
2. UserPromptSubmit: Performs semantic search using vector store on user prompts
3. Stop: Currently disabled - memory extraction handled by MCP server daemon instead

Hooks are shell commands configured in .claude/settings.json that receive JSON input via stdin.
