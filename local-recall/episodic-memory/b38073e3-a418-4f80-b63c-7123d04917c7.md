# Memory Extraction Process

Extracting valuable memories from Claude Code transcripts requires two key steps:

1. **Keyword Extraction**: Use Claude Haiku (lightweight) to extract keywords from conversation content
2. **Semantic Understanding**: The extracted memories must capture architectural decisions, bug fixes, and codebase-specific patterns

## Why This Matters

- Raw transcripts are verbose and contain noise (debugging steps, temporary fixes)
- Memories need to be concise, actionable, and specific to the codebase
- Keywords enable fuzzy search so future sessions can find relevant context
- Scope (global/file/area) determines when memories are relevant

## Key Insight

Not everything in a transcript is worth remembering. The memory extraction process must filter for:
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root causes
- Code patterns and conventions
- User preferences
- Important component relationships

And exclude:
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
