The memory extractor implements comprehensive result handling:

- Returns `ExtractionResult` type with `created` and `skipped` arrays
- Skipped memories include reasons (e.g., duplicate content, extraction failure)
- Uses try-catch blocks to handle API errors gracefully
- Logs detailed information including:
  - Number of memories extracted
  - Duplicate detection results
  - API errors and fallback behavior
  - Processing time and status

This approach ensures visibility into the extraction process and helps debug issues with memory creation.
