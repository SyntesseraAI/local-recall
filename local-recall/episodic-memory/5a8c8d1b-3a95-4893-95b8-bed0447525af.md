Claude Code hooks receive JSON input via stdin and output results to stdout. SessionStart hook loads 5 most recent memories (sorted by occurred_at). UserPromptSubmit hook performs semantic search using vector store. Both hooks are configured in `hooks.json` as shell commands with timeout settings (30-60 seconds).
