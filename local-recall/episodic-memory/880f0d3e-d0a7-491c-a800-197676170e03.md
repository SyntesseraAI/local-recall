# Memory Extraction Task Request

The user requested keyword extraction from a text block and wanted the response in JSON array format with no additional explanation.

This appears to be part of testing or setting up the memory extraction functionality within Local Recall itself - using the system's own mechanisms to create memories about how transcripts should be processed.
