The MCP server runs a background daemon that:
1. Monitors for new or changed transcripts in Claude's cache
2. Uses content hashes to detect transcript changes
3. Processes transcripts with Claude Haiku to extract memories
4. Runs every 5 minutes for continuous memory collection
5. Handles transcript deletion by removing associated memories

This enables passive memory extraction without requiring explicit user action.
