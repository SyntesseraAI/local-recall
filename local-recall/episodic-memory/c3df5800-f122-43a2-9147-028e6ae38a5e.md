Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files stored locally in the repository. The system includes:
- Core memory management (CRUD operations, vector store with SQLite)
- Claude Code hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop)
- MCP server for tool exposure
- Semantic search using fastembed embeddings (BGE-small-en-v1.5 model)
- Memory extraction from transcripts

All memories are version-controlled and use YAML frontmatter with fields like id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, and content_hash.
