The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude's streaming API to extract memories from condensed transcripts. It condenses transcripts before sending them to reduce token usage and improve efficiency. The extractor processes the streaming response to build memory objects incrementally and handles cost tracking for the operation.
