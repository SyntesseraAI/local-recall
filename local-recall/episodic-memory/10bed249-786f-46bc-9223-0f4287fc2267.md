Local Recall uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic embeddings. Model is ~133MB and auto-downloads to `local_cache/` on first use. First run takes 30-60 seconds for download; subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file error occurs (`tokenizer.json` not found), delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to force re-download.
