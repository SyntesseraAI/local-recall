The extraction prompt has been moved to a dedicated prompts module (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) to separate concerns from the extraction logic. This allows:

- Easy updates to extraction rules and guidelines
- Consistent prompt versioning
- Reusability across different memory extraction contexts
- Clear separation between prompt content and execution logic

The prompt includes detailed guidelines about what to extract and what to avoid, along with specific formatting requirements for the JSON output.
