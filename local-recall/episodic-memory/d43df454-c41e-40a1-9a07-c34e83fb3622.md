The system includes transcript condensing functionality that creates concise summaries of session events before passing them to Claude for memory extraction. This reduces token usage and improves extraction efficiency while maintaining relevant context. The condensed format uses structured event notation like [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], and [Result: OK/ERROR].
