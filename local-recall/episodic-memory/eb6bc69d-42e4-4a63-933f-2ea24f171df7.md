The local-recall project has standardized on using the `claude-3-5-sonnet` model for memory extraction from transcripts. This model choice balances:

- Good performance on understanding complex code and architectural concepts
- Reasonable cost compared to larger models like opus
- Sufficient speed for near-real-time transcript processing
- Adequate instruction-following capability for memory extraction tasks

Other models in the codebase (like claude-haiku for keyword extraction in hooks) are used for simpler, faster tasks where quality can be reduced.
