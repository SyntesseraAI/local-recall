# Transcript Collection and Memory Extraction Workflow

## Overview

Local Recall uses a background daemon in the MCP server to automatically collect transcripts from Claude's cache and extract memories asynchronously.

## Process Flow

1. **Collection**: Transcripts are synced from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/` to the local-recall project
2. **Processing**: Transcripts are processed using `claude -p` command to extract memories
3. **Deduplication**: Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes to detect changes
4. **Memory Creation**: Extracted memories are stored as markdown files
5. **Schedule**: Runs every 5 minutes in the background

## Key Components

- `transcript-collector.ts` - Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache
- `transcript-condenser.ts` - Condenses/prepares transcripts for processing
- `memory-extractor.ts` - Extracts memories from transcripts using Claude
- `processed-log.ts` - Tracks which transcripts have been processed and their hashes

## Advantages of Background Processing

- Doesn't block Claude Code during sessions
- Allows time for context to settle before extraction
- Can process larger transcripts efficiently
- Handles transcript updates and deduplication automatically
