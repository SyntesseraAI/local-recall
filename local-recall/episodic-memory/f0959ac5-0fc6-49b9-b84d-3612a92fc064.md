When rebuilding the plugin (npm run build in the local-recall project), the hook scripts in dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/ are regenerated from the main src/hooks/ TypeScript sources. This ensures the plugin's hooks always use the latest implementation. After any migration in the main hooks (like switching from better-sqlite3 to Orama), the plugin must be rebuilt to get the updated hooks. The hooks.json configuration should point to the new hook files after rebuild.
