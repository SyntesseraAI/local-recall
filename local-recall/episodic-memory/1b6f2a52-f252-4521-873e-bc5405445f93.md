Local Recall uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. First run downloads the model to `local_cache/` directory (30-60 seconds). Subsequent runs load from cache. If 'Tokenizer file not found' error occurs, delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and let model re-download.
