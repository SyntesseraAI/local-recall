# Memory Extraction from Transcripts

Local Recall extracts memories from Claude Code session transcripts through a structured pipeline:

## Process

1. **Transcript Collection**: The transcript-collector reads from Claude's transcript cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
2. **Transcript Condensing**: Raw transcripts are condensed to extract key information (user requests, assistant responses, tool invocations)
3. **Memory Extraction**: Claude Haiku processes condensed transcripts to identify and create memories
4. **Duplicate Detection**: Content hashes prevent duplicate memories from being created

## Key Components

- `transcript-collector.ts`: Reads transcripts from Claude's cache
- `memory-extractor.ts`: Processes condensed transcripts and creates memories
- Background daemon runs every 5 minutes to process new transcripts

## Current Implementation

Memories are created asynchronously by the MCP server daemon, not during the Stop hook. This allows for better performance and handles transcript processing in the background.
