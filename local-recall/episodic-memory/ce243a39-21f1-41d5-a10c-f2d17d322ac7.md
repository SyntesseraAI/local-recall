The thinking memory extraction was implemented but never actually called by the MCP server daemon. The daemon loop only called `runTranscriptProcessing()` for episodic memories. To fix this, thinking extraction now runs in parallel with episodic extraction using separate flags:

- `isEpisodicProcessing` flag prevents concurrent episodic runs
- `isThinkingProcessing` flag prevents concurrent thinking runs
- Both can run simultaneously without blocking each other

This is invoked in the daemon loop via `runThinkingExtraction()` with proper error handling and logging.
