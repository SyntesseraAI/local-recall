# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path using a hash-based directory structure:
- Claude hashes the full project path
- Creates a directory structure like `~/.claude/projects/<hash>/`
- Stores transcripts in `transcripts/` subdirectory

## Transcript Files

Transcript files are stored in JSONL format with filenames like:
- `transcript_2024-12-01_14-30-45.jsonl`
- Format: One JSON object per line
- Each line contains a transcript event with timestamp

## Key Implementation Detail

When collecting transcripts for the local-recall project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`, the MCP server must:
1. Calculate the project hash from the full working directory path
2. Construct the path: `~/.claude/projects/<hash>/transcripts/`
3. Read and parse JSONL files to extract memory-worthy events

This location is critical for the transcript-collector to sync with Claude's native transcript storage and extract memories asynchronously.
