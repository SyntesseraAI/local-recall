Memory scope is defined in the `applies_to` field with three patterns:

1. **global**: Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
2. **file:<path>**: Specific to particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
3. **area:<name>**: Related to component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

Choosing the correct scope is important for relevance - use specific scopes to avoid false positives in unrelated parts of the codebase.
