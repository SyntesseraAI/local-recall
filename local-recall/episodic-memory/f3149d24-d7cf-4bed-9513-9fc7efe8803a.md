# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Directory Naming

Project folders use encoded directory names where the absolute path has slashes replaced with dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- The project folder is located at: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcripts Storage

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-project-name>/transcripts/`

## Important for Transcript Processing

When building systems that process Claude transcripts:
1. Account for the directory encoding scheme (slashes → dashes)
2. Transcripts follow JSONL format (one JSON object per line)
3. The transcript path is provided to hooks via the `transcript_path` field in stdin JSON
4. The MCP server and background daemons need to monitor and process these transcripts asynchronously
