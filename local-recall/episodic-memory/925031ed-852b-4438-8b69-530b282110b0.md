The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses the Anthropic Claude API client to process transcripts. It streams responses from Claude to extract structured memories, using a system prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. The extraction process handles transcript analysis to identify and format memories for storage.
