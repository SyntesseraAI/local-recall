Local Recall is a sophisticated memory management system that allows Claude Code and other AI tools to retain context across sessions. Key architectural components:

- **Memory Storage**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
- **Vector Search**: Uses `fastembed` with BGE-small-en-v1.5 embeddings and SQLite with sqlite-vec extension
- **Integration**: Hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit) and MCP server for seamless integration
- **Scope System**: Memories can have scope of `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>` for targeted relevance
