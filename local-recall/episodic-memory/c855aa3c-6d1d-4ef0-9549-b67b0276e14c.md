The vector store implementation (`src/core/vector-store.ts`) uses:
- **Database**: better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for similarity search
- **Embeddings**: fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB)
- **Model Cache**: Downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first run
- **Scoring**: Cosine distance similarity (0.0 to 1.0), rounded to 2 decimal places
- **Ranking**: Results sorted by score descending, with recency (occurred_at) as tie-breaker

First startup takes 30-60 seconds for model download. Subsequent runs load from cache.
