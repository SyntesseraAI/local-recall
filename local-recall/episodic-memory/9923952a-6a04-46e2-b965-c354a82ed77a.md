# Project Identification Strategy

Local Recall identifies projects by converting the absolute working directory path into a slug:

1. Take the absolute working directory path
2. Convert to lowercase
3. Replace path separators and special characters with dashes
4. This becomes the project identifier

This slug is used to:
- Find the correct Claude project folder in `~/.claude/projects/{slug}/`
- Locate transcripts for the current project
- Maintain separate memory indices per project

Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `users-joe-code-syntessera-local-recall`

This approach allows local-recall to be installed once and work with multiple projects simultaneously.
