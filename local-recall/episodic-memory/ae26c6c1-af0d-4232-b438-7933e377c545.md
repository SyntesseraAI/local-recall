When extracting memories from session transcripts, focus on:
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

Avoid extracting:
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly
