The `syncTranscripts()` method in transcript-collector.ts was inefficiently copying synthetic transcripts from Claude's cache before cleaning them up. The process now checks `isSyntheticFile(transcript.sourcePath)` before copying to avoid unnecessary I/O. The cleanup still runs first to remove any synthetic files that may have slipped through previously, but new/modified transcripts are now filtered before being copied.
