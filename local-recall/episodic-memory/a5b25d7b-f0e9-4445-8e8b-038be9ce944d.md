The vector store implements semantic search using SQLite with the sqlite-vec extension and fastembed embeddings. Search results are scored using cosine distance (0.0-1.0 range, rounded to 2 decimal places). Results are sorted by similarity score descending. When scores are equal, more recent memories (by `occurred_at` timestamp) are ranked first as a tie-breaker.
