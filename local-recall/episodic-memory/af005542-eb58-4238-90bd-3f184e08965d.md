The vector store in `src/core/vector-store.ts` uses better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings are generated using fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). Search uses cosine distance similarity with scores 0.0-1.0 (rounded to 2 decimals). Results are sorted by score descending with recency tie-breaker (occurred_at) for equal scores.
