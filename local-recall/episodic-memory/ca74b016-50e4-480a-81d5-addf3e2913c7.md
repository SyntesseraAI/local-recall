Session transcripts are the primary source of information for memory creation in Local Recall. The system analyzes these transcripts to extract valuable memories that help future AI assistants working on the codebase. This is handled by the MCP server which processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes, detecting changes via content hashes and regenerating memories as needed.
