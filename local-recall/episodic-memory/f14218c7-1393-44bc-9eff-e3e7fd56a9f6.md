The memory extraction system uses Claude's API (via the `claude-sdk` package) with streaming enabled to process transcripts efficiently. The `extractMemories` function receives a transcript and processes it through the Claude API with specific prompts defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. Streaming is important for managing token usage and handling large transcripts effectively.
