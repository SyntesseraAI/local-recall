The extraction system creates memories with carefully selected scopes:

- `global` - For architectural decisions, conventions, and project-wide knowledge
- `file:<path>` - For file-specific implementation details and patterns
- `area:<name>` - For component or functional area knowledge

Each memory includes:
- Unique ID (UUID)
- Subject (one-line description)
- Keywords (for searchability)
- Content (detailed markdown)
- Metadata (occurred_at timestamp, content_hash for deduplication)

This enables targeted memory retrieval during future sessions based on context (file being edited, area being worked on).
