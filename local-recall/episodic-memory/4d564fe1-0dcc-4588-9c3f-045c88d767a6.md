# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

When processing transcripts for memory extraction, the system uses a condensing algorithm to reduce transcript size while preserving essential information.

## Condensing Pattern

The condensed transcript format uses simplified event notation:
- `[User]` - User request or question
- `[Assistant]` - Claude response or explanation
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocation (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocation

## Purpose

Condensing transcripts:
1. Reduces token usage and context size when analyzing for memory extraction
2. Removes noise like verbose tool outputs
3. Preserves the semantic flow of the conversation
4. Makes it easier to identify what was learned and decisions made
5. Enables efficient processing in memory extraction pipelines

This is especially useful for long sessions where the full transcript would exceed context limits.
