# User Workflow for Memory Extraction

The user's typical workflow involves:

1. Working with Claude Code on the local-recall project
2. Requesting analysis of session transcripts to extract valuable memories
3. Expecting the system to identify architectural decisions, bug fixes, learned patterns, and project-specific knowledge
4. Storing these as structured markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`

## Memory Extraction Criteria

The user has specific guidelines for what should be extracted:
- **DO extract**: Architecture decisions, bug fixes with root cause, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, performance optimizations
- **DO NOT extract**: Generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, sensitive data, quickly-outdated information

## Output Format

Memories should be returned as JSON with fields: `subject`, `keywords`, `applies_to`, and `content` in markdown format.
