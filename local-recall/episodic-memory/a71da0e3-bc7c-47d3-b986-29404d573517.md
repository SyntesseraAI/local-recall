Local Recall uses BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model via fastembed library:

**Model Details**:
- Model size: ~133MB
- Location: `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`
- Auto-downloaded on first use
- Cached for subsequent runs
- Used for semantic search via vector embeddings

**Performance**:
- First startup: 30-60 seconds (initial model download)
- Subsequent runs: Instant (loads from cache)

**Troubleshooting - Tokenizer Error**:
If error occurs: `Error: Tokenizer file not found at local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json`
- This indicates corrupted/incomplete cache (usually from interrupted download)
- Fix: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*`
- Model will re-download automatically on next run
