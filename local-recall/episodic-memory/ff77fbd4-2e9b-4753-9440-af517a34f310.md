The memory extraction process uses a two-stage approach:
1. **Transcript Condensing**: First condenses the full transcript into key events (User requests, Assistant responses, Tool invocations, Results) to reduce context
2. **Memory Extraction**: Then analyzes the condensed transcript to extract valuable memories

This two-stage approach improves efficiency by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed by the memory extraction model, while preserving the essential information needed to identify learnings and discoveries.
