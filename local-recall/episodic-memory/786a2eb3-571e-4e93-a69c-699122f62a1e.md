The logging system writes to `local-recall/recall.log` with configurable log levels via the LOCAL_RECALL_LOG_LEVEL environment variable. Default is 'error' level. Debug-level logs won't be visible to users by default, so important diagnostic information should use INFO level for visibility during troubleshooting.
