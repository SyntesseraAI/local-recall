# Transcript Condensing Process

The transcript collector uses Claude to condense transcripts before memory extraction. This is useful for:

1. **Reducing Context Size**: Large transcripts become unwieldy for processing
2. **Preserving Structure**: Condensing maintains the event structure needed for memory extraction
3. **Improving Relevance**: Only useful information is retained

## Implementation Details

The condensing process:
- Takes a raw transcript (JSONL format)
- Sends it to Claude (via `claude -p` command) with instructions to condense it
- Returns a condensed version maintaining the same structure
- The condensed transcript is then used for memory extraction

## Use Case

This is particularly important for long sessions where the transcript could be hundreds of KB or MB. By condensing first, subsequent memory extraction is faster and more focused.
