Local Recall enforces strict development standards:

**Testing Requirements**:
- ALL new features must have corresponding unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests go in `tests/integration/`
- Tests must cover both happy paths and edge cases
- Run with: `npm test`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Documentation placed in `docs/` folder
- Update existing docs when modifying functionality
- Each memory should have relevant, specific keywords
- Consider scope carefully: `global` vs `file:` vs `area:`

**Build & Development**:
- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript
- `npm run dev` - Watch mode
- `npm run lint` - Lint code
- `npm run mcp:start` - Start MCP server
- Requires Node.js 18+ and TypeScript 5.9+

**Memory Creation Guidelines**:
- Memory files ARE version-controlled (committed to git)
- Memories should be atomic (one concept per file)
- Use specific, lowercase keywords
- Include file paths and function names for specificity
