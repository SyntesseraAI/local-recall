Migrated memory storage from individual markdown files to JSONL format with three entry types: 'add', 'delete', 'embedding'. Memories are split across multiple files with 500 entries each, using sequential file naming with 6-digit padding (episodic-000001.jsonl, episodic-000002.jsonl, etc.) to support up to 999,999 files (~500 million memories). Files are loaded sequentially in order, allowing proper replay of entry history. This design prevents single large files that cause git/performance issues.
