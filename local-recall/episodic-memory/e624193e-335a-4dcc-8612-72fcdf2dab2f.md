Local Recall is a memory management system that stores memories as markdown files with YAML frontmatter. It integrates with Claude Code via hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop) and exposes tools via MCP server. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings (fastembed, BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic search. Memories are stored in local-recall/episodic-memory/ and are version-controlled in git.
