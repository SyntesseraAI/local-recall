The vector store search implementation uses cosine distance similarity scoring:

- Score range: 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (identical)
- Scores rounded to 2 decimal places (e.g., 0.65)
- Results sorted by score descending
- **Tie-breaking**: When scores are equal, more recent memories (occurred_at) ranked first

This ensures highly relevant results while preventing older duplicate information from appearing higher in rankings.
