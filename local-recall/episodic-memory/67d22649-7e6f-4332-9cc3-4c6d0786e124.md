Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files stored in the repository. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings (fastembed BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic search, allowing memories to be version-controlled and shared among team members.

Key features:
- Memory files stored as markdown with YAML frontmatter in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
- Vector store for semantic search using cosine distance similarity
- Claude Code hooks for SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, and Stop events
- MCP server for exposing memory tools to other clients
- Background daemon syncing transcripts every 5 minutes
