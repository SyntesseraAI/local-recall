# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Naming Convention

The project folder name is derived from the working directory path with these rules:
- Forward slashes (`/`) are converted to underscores (`_`)
- The leading underscore is removed from the result
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory within each project folder:
`~/.claude/projects/Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

## Relevance to Local Recall

The `TranscriptCollector` in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` needs to correctly convert working directory paths to match Claude's internal naming convention when collecting transcripts for memory extraction.
