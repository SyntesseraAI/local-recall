# Keyword Extraction for Memory Indexing

When searching memories based on user prompts, keywords should be extracted from the prompt text to enable fuzzy matching against the memory index.

## Implementation Approach

Keywords can be extracted using Claude Haiku via the CLI (`claude -p --model haiku`) to intelligently identify relevant terms from natural language prompts.

## Benefits

- Enables semantic search rather than simple string matching
- Improves recall by finding memories with conceptually related keywords
- Reduces false positives from overly broad searches
