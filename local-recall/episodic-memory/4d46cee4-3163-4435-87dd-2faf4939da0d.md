Transcript condensing is implemented to improve efficiency:

- Combines consecutive user and assistant messages into single events
- Avoids processing duplicate or near-duplicate tool results
- Reduces the number of Claude Haiku calls needed for keyword extraction
- Implemented in the transcript collector before passing to memory extraction
- Helps manage token usage and processing time for transcripts
