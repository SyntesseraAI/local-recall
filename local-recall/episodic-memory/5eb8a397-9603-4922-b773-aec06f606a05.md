Local-recall project root IS the plugin root following Claude Code's plugin format. Hooks use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` to reference bundled scripts relative to plugin installation. Scripts are built output in `scripts/` directory (gitignored). Hooks receive `cwd` via stdin to operate on user's project directory. Hook scripts are bundled JavaScript files generated during build.
