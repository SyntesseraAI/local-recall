The memory extraction process converts full transcripts into a condensed event format before sending to Claude for analysis. The condensed format includes: [User] entries for user requests, [Assistant] entries for responses, [Tool: Name] for tool invocations, and [Result: OK/ERROR] for outcomes. This significantly reduces token usage while preserving essential information for memory extraction.
