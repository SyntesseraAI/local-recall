The memory extraction system uses Claude (via `claude -p` command) with a specialized memory-extraction prompt to analyze session transcripts and generate memory objects. The extraction prompt is defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and is used by the memory-extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` to parse transcripts and create structured memories.
