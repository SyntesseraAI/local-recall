# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

## Problem

Full transcripts can become very large over time, making them inefficient to process for memory extraction due to context window limitations and processing overhead.

## Solution

Implement a transcript condensing system that:
1. Strips unnecessary formatting and metadata from raw transcript JSON
2. Compresses message history into a more compact format
3. Preserves essential information needed for memory extraction
4. Reduces the transcript size significantly while maintaining semantic meaning

## Implementation Details

The condensing process should:
- Extract only the essential parts of each message (user input, assistant response, tool calls)
- Remove intermediate tool outputs and formatting
- Create a summary representation suitable for Claude's prompt processing
- Maintain chronological order and context relationships

## Benefits

- Reduced context window usage when processing transcripts
- Faster memory extraction from the MCP server daemon
- More efficient storage and transmission of transcript data
- Better performance for the background transcript processing loop
