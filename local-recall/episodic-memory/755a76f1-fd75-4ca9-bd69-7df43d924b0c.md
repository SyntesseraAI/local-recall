The memory extraction prompt includes explicit guidelines to help Claude determine what should and shouldn't be extracted:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to this project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during the session
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations or optimizations applied

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that would become outdated quickly

This distinction ensures extracted memories are truly valuable for future sessions.
