The system uses independent configuration flags to control which memory types are retrieved and injected into Claude's context:

- `episodicEnabled` - Controls whether episodic memories are retrieved (default: true)
- `thinkingEnabled` - Controls whether thinking memories are retrieved (default: true)

These flags allow users to configure the balance of memory types based on their needs. The hooks check these flags before performing retrieval and injection, ensuring that disabled memory types are not included even if they exist in storage.
