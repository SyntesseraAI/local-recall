Memory scope is determined by the `applies_to` field:
- `global`: Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>`: Specific to a file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>`: Related to component/area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

Hooks use scope to filter which memories are relevant to the current context. SessionStart uses cwd and file paths to find relevant memories. This prevents overwhelming Claude with irrelevant information.
