The `ensureGitignore()` method (lines 190-209) was updated to call `ensureDir()` first to create the `local-recall` base directory if needed. This makes the method robust for fresh projects where the local-recall folder hasn't been created yet. This ensures that `.gitignore` can be written on the very first session start.
