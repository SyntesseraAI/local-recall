The memory extraction prompt (`memory-extraction.ts`) provides Claude with structured guidance on analyzing transcripts. It defines categories like 'what was learned', 'what is now known', 'problems solved', and 'codebase-specific patterns'. The prompt also includes clear guidelines on what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns) vs what to skip (generic knowledge, sensitive data, temporary debugging steps). This systematic approach ensures consistent, high-quality memory creation.
