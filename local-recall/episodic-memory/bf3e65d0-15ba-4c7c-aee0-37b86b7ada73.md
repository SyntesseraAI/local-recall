Transcripts are processed in a condensed event-based format with markers like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, and `[Tool: Name]`. The memory extractor parses these events to understand the context of the session. This condensed format is more efficient than processing raw transcripts and makes keyword extraction more relevant.
