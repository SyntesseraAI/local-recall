All core components are fully implemented:
- **Memory Manager** (`src/core/memory.ts`): Create, read, delete operations with duplicate detection
- **Index Manager** (`src/core/index.ts`): Build, get, and refresh keyword index stored in `local-recall/index.json`
- **Search** (`src/core/search.ts`): Fuzzy search using Fuse.js for keywords, subjects, and scope filtering
- **MCP Server** (`src/mcp-server/`): Exposes 6 tools (memory_create, memory_delete, memory_search, memory_list, index_rebuild, and background sync)
- **Hooks**: SessionStart (loads relevant memories) and UserPromptSubmit (searches and injects matching memories) are complete
