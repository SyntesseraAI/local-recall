# MCP Server Transcript Processing

The MCP server runs a background daemon that:

1. Scans transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
2. Processes each transcript to extract memories using claude -p
3. Tracks processed transcripts by content hash
4. Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
5. Runs periodically (every 5 minutes by default)

This is documented in CLAUDE.md under "Background Daemon" section and is the primary mechanism for converting session transcripts into persistent memories.
