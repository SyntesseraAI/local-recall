The vector store (`src/core/vector-store.ts`) uses better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search. It generates embeddings using fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB, cached in `local_cache/`). Search results use cosine distance scoring (0.0-1.0 range, rounded to 2 decimals), sorted descending by score. When scores are equal, more recent memories (`occurred_at`) are ranked first as a tie-breaker.
