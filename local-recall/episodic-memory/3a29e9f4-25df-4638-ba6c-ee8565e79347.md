Guidelines for extracting memories:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations applied

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, PII)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

Memories must be specific (include file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes).
