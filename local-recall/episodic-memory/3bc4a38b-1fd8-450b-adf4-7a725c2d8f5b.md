The local-recall/transcripts directory contains 39,879 total JSONL transcript files. Of these, 12,594 are synthetic files (generated during memory extraction tests) and 27,285 are real transcripts from actual Claude sessions. Only 51 transcripts (out of ~40k) contain thinking blocks, totaling 1,101 thinking block instances.

Synthetic files can be identified by the presence of `"<synthetic>"` in the model field. Real transcripts use models like `claude-opus-4-5-20251101`. Files with thinking blocks also contain `thinkingMetadata` with fields like `{"level":"high","disabled":false,"triggers":[]}` and thinking block objects with `{"type":"thinking","thinking":"...","signature":"..."}`.
