The UserPromptSubmit hook is triggered before Claude processes a user's prompt. It extracts keywords from the user's input using Claude Haiku, then searches the memory index for matching keywords using fuzzy matching. Matching memories are output to stdout and injected into Claude's context window. This ensures Claude has relevant historical context and previous learnings about the codebase when responding to user requests.
