New exported function `parseTranscriptForMemories(rawContent: string): MemorySuggestion[]` that processes raw JSONL transcript format and extracts memory-worthy content. Takes raw JSONL string (as read from transcript file) and returns array of memory suggestions ready to be saved.

The function:
- Parses each JSONL line, extracting user/assistant messages
- Handles both string content and ContentBlock arrays (with text and thinking)
- Calls analyzeForMemories() to filter and suggest memories
- Returns MemorySuggestion[] with subject, keywords, applies_to, content, and occurred_at

This centralizes memory extraction logic and makes it reusable from any context (hooks, MCP server, etc).
