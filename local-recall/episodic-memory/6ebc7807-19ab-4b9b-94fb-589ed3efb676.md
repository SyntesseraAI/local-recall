The thinking memory extraction was implemented in `src/core/thinking-extractor.ts` but was never being called by the MCP server daemon. The daemon in `src/mcp-server/server.ts` only called `runTranscriptProcessing()` for episodic memories, leaving thinking extraction inactive. A separate daemon call was added to run thinking memory extraction in parallel with episodic extraction using flags `isEpisodicProcessing` and `isThinkingProcessing` to prevent concurrent runs of each type.
