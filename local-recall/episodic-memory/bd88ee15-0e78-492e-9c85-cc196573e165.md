# Memory Extraction Guidelines

Memories should be:
- **Specific**: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- **Concise**: Focus on one concept or discovery per memory
- **Actionable**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently

## What to Extract

DO extract:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to this project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during the session
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

## What NOT to Extract

DO NOT extract:
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that would become outdated quickly

## Memory Scope

Use appropriate scope based on applicability:
- `global` - Entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`)
