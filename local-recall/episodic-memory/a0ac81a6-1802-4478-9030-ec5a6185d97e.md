When creating memories, always use the appropriate scope:
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

Proper scoping helps future assistants understand where knowledge applies and prevents overgeneralization.
