Local Recall uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. Model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use, taking 30-60 seconds. Subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file not found error occurs, the cache is corrupted and should be removed with `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to allow re-download.
