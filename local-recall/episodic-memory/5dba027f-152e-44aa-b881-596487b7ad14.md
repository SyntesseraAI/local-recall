# Memory Extraction Uses Transcript Condensing

The memory extraction pipeline uses transcript condensing to improve efficiency and reduce token usage.

## Process Overview

1. **Raw Transcript**: Collected from Claude Code session transcripts
2. **Condensing**: Uses Claude Haiku to summarize/condense the transcript while preserving important details
3. **Memory Extraction**: Processes the condensed transcript to extract specific memories

## Benefits

- Reduces token consumption when sending to Claude for analysis
- Maintains important context while removing noise
- Improves quality of extracted memories by focusing on significant events
- Faster processing times

## Implementation Notes

- Condensing should preserve:
  - User queries and commands
  - Important assistant responses
  - Tool invocations and results
  - Code changes and their context
- Should remove:
  - Redundant explanations
  - Verbose output
  - Temporary debugging steps
