# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the project's transcript directory

## Relevance to local-recall

The transcript-collector utility needs to locate these files at the correct path to process them for memory extraction. This is critical for the background daemon functionality that extracts memories from Claude Code sessions.
