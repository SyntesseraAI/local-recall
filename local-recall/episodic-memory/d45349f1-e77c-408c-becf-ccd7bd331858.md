The memory extraction system expects Claude to return a valid JSON object with a 'memories' array. Each extracted memory must have: subject (brief description), keywords (array of searchable terms), applies_to (scope: global/file:<path>/area:<name>), and content (detailed markdown). The system parses this JSON response to create structured memory files in local-recall/episodic-memory/.
