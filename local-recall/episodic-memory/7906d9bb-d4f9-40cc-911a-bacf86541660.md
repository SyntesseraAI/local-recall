The memory extraction system is designed to extract only valuable long-term insights and avoid noise. DO extract: architectural decisions, bug fixes with root cause analysis, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, performance optimizations. DO NOT extract: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, sensitive data, outdated information.
