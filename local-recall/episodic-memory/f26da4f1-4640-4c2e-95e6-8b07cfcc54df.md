New files `src/core/vector-store.ts` and `src/core/embedding.ts` are being added to implement semantic search capabilities in addition to keyword-based search.

Key details:
- Uses `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB)
- Model auto-downloads to `local_cache/` on first use
- First run may take 30-60 seconds for model download
- Provides semantic similarity search beyond keyword matching
- This enables finding memories based on meaning, not just keywords

Note: The embedding model cache is in `local_cache/` and may occasionally need manual cleanup if corrupted during interrupted downloads.
