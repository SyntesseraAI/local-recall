The fastembed BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use. First startup may take 30-60 seconds for the download. Subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer.json is missing or cache is corrupted (from interrupted downloads), remove the directory with `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and it will re-download on next run.
