The memory extraction system in Local Recall uses Claude Haiku model via `claude -p --model haiku` command to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. It leverages dedicated prompt templates from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guide the extraction process. The system follows specific guidelines for memory extraction including: being specific with file paths and function names, being concise (one concept per memory), being actionable for future assistants, and using appropriate scope (global, file-specific, or area-specific). The extraction process filters out generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and sensitive data.
