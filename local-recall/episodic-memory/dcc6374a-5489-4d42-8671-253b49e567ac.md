Local Recall has multiple core components:

**Vector Store** (`src/core/vector-store.ts`): SQLite-backed store using `better-sqlite3` with the `sqlite-vec` extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings are generated using `fastembed` with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB).

**Search** (`src/core/search.ts`): Semantic search using vector embeddings with cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0-1.0 range). Results are sorted by score descending with recency tie-breaker.

**MCP Server** (`src/mcp-server/`): Exposes memory tools to MCP-compatible clients. Runs background daemon syncing transcripts every 5 minutes.

**Memory Manager** (`src/core/memory.ts`): CRD operations for memory files (no update - memories are idempotent).
