# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Structure

Each Claude Code project has a folder under `~/.claude/projects/` where the folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes.

### Example

For a project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`:
- Folder: `~/.claude/projects/_Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`
- Transcripts location: `~/.claude/projects/_Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) files. Each line is a separate JSON object representing a message or event in the transcript.

## Relevance

This is important for the MCP server's background daemon which needs to sync transcripts from Claude's cache and process them to extract memories.
