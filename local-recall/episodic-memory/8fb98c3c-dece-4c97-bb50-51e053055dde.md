The UserPromptSubmit hook extracts keywords from user prompts by calling `claude -p --model haiku` with a specific prompt asking Claude to extract keywords. The returned keywords are then used for fuzzy searching the memory index.

This is done synchronously before Claude processes the prompt, so relevant memories can be injected into the context immediately.
