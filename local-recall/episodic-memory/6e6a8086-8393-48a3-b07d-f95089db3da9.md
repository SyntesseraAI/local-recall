The memory extractor prevents duplicate memories by passing both occurred_at (ISO-8601 timestamp of when the event happened) and content_hash (SHA-256 hash of the memory content) to the memory creation process. The memory manager's findDuplicate function checks for existing memories with matching occurred_at and content_hash to avoid creating duplicate entries.
