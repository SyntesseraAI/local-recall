# Memory Extraction Strategy

## What to Extract

When processing Claude Code transcripts, focus on **what was discussed and learned**, not the mechanics of tool invocations.

### Good memories to extract:
- Conversations between user and Claude about architecture decisions
- Insights Claude provided about the codebase
- Solutions discussed for problems
- User preferences or feedback on approaches
- Important discoveries about how the code works

### Bad memories to extract:
- Tool invocation details (Read, Edit, Bash, etc.)
- Step-by-step tool sequences
- File path changes or file operations
- Technical details about how tools work

## Reasoning

Memories should capture **valuable context and understanding** that will help future AI assistants work more effectively. Raw tool invocation logs add noise without adding insight.

The transcript structure naturally separates:
- `[User]` - User's intent and questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations (valuable)
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool usage (less valuable)
- `[Result]` - Outcomes (sometimes valuable if revealing unexpected behavior)
