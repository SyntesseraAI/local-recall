The memory extraction system uses `claude -p --model haiku` to process transcripts and extract meaningful keywords. This approach allows dynamic keyword identification from session content rather than hard-coded extraction rules. The UserPromptSubmit hook uses this same technique to extract keywords from user prompts for memory searching.
