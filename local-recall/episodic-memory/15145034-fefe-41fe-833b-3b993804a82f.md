Local Recall is a local markdown-powered memory system that allows Claude Code and other AI tools (via MCP) to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. All memories are stored locally within the repository, making them version-controllable and shareable among team members.

Key components:
- Memory Manager (src/core/memory.ts) - CRD operations for memory files
- Index Manager (src/core/index.ts) - Maintains searchable index of keywords
- Search (src/core/search.ts) - Fuzzy search implementation
- Claude Code hooks for SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, and Stop events
- MCP server exposing memory tools to compatible clients
- Background daemon syncing transcripts and extracting memories every 5 minutes
