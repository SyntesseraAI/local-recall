# Stop Hook Status

The Stop hook is currently DISABLED.

## Why Disabled

Memory extraction is now handled by the MCP server daemon instead of the Stop hook:

1. The MCP server runs a background daemon
2. It processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes
3. It syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
4. Extracts memories using `claude -p` command
5. Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
6. Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change

## Benefits

- Non-blocking: Doesn't slow down end of session
- Asynchronous: Processes in the background
- Change detection: Only re-processes modified transcripts
- More reliable: Separate daemon handles extraction
