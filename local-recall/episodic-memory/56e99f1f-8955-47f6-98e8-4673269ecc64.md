# Memory Extraction from Transcripts

## Important Distinction

When extracting memories from Claude Code transcripts, it's critical to distinguish between:
- User requests and questions (questions themselves don't warrant memories)
- Assistant responses and explanations (valuable knowledge to retain)
- Tool invocations and results (for context, but not typically memory-worthy on their own)

## Key Principle

Memories should capture **knowledge and insights**, not just questions asked. A user asking "How do I find transcripts?" is not itself memory-worthy—but the answer about WHERE transcripts are located IS valuable.

## Examples

**Don't extract:** "User asked where Claude stores transcripts"
**DO extract:** "Claude stores project transcripts at ~/.claude/projects/ with hash-based directory structure and JSONL format"

## Application

This principle ensures memories are actionable knowledge that helps future assistants work more effectively, rather than just recording what questions were asked during a session.
