The system processes session transcripts to extract valuable memories for future sessions. This is part of the episodic memory system that stores learned information from interactions. Memory extraction happens after sessions complete or asynchronously via the MCP server daemon. The extracted memories are stored as markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`.
