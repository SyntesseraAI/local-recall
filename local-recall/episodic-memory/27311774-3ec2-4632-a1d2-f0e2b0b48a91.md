The transcript processing pipeline uses a two-stage approach:

1. **Condensing Stage** - Raw transcripts are condensed into a structured event format with tool invocations and results clearly marked
2. **Extraction Stage** - The condensed transcript is then analyzed to extract valuable memories

This separation allows for cleaner processing and makes it easier to identify what was actually learned during a session.
