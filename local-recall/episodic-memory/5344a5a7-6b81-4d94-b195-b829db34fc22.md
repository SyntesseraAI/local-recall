The MemoryManager class was not creating the .gitignore file in the local-recall directory. While IndexManager had ensureGitignore() logic, MemoryManager only created the memories subdirectory without ensuring the root .gitignore file existed. This could cause issues with version control. Both classes should coordinate to ensure .gitignore is created once at the root level. Fix: Add ensureGitignore() call in MemoryManager's constructor or initialization method.
