When extracting memories from transcripts, prioritize:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

**Scope guidelines:**
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase
- `file:<path>` - Specific to one file
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area
