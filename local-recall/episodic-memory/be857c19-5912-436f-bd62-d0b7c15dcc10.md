The memory extraction process uses transcript condensing as an optimization technique. This involves:

- Analyzing full transcripts from Claude Code sessions
- Condensing them into essential events and tool invocations
- Reducing the token count sent to Claude for memory extraction
- Maintaining semantic meaning while removing noise

This approach balances extraction accuracy with API costs and latency. The condensed format includes `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]` events.
