Claude stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project directories use URL-encoded paths with dashes replacing slashes (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/` for `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`). Individual transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (one JSON object per line). This is important for the transcript-collector component which needs to locate and parse these files for memory extraction.
