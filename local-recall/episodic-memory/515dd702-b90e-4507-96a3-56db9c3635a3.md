The local-recall project leverages Claude API streaming for memory extraction operations. This design choice provides:
- Real-time processing of transcript analysis
- Reduced memory footprint when processing large transcripts
- Better user experience with progressive output
- More efficient token usage patterns

Streamng is integrated into the core memory extraction workflow in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts`.
