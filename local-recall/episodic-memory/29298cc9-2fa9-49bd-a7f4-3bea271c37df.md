The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model with a specialized extraction prompt. The system parses session transcripts to identify and extract valuable memories that should be persisted for future sessions. The extraction uses a structured prompt-based approach with defined keywords and memory formatting requirements.
