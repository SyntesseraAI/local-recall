Key guidelines for extracting memories:

**DO Extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered in sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations and optimizations

**DO NOT Extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

**Scope Guidelines:**
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to particular files (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to components (e.g., `area:authentication`)
