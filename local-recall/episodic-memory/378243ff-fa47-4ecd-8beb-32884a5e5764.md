The memory extraction system distinguishes between different types of memories:
- **Completed tasks**: Extracts learnings, solutions, and architectural decisions that were implemented
- **Ongoing tasks**: Captures patterns, conventions, and work-in-progress insights
- **Code patterns**: Identifies specific patterns, conventions, and architectural patterns used in the codebase
- **Decisions**: Records architectural decisions and their reasoning

This allows memories to be tagged appropriately for future reuse based on the context of the work.
