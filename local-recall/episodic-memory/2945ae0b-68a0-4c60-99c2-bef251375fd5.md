When the memory extractor parses Claude responses containing malformed or incomplete JSON objects, empty objects {} are created and added to the memories array instead of being filtered out. This causes invalid memories to be persisted. The extraction process should validate that memory objects have required fields (subject, keywords, applies_to, content) before adding them to the memories array.
