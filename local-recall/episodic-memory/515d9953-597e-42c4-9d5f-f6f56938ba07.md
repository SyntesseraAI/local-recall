The memory system includes deduplication logic that checks for existing memories before creating new ones. This uses a combination of:
- `content_hash`: SHA-256 hash prefix of memory content
- `occurred_at`: Timestamp when the event occurred

The `findDuplicate()` method checks these fields to prevent storing the same memory multiple times, making the system idempotent and reducing storage of redundant information.
