# User Preference: Refactoring Over New Files

The user prefers refactoring and improving existing code structures rather than creating new files when possible.

## Context

When the transcript-collector functionality was being added, there was discussion about:
- Whether to create a new separate module for transcript collection
- Or refactor existing code to integrate the functionality

## Preference Statement

The user explicitly favors:
- Keeping code consolidated in existing modules when it makes sense
- Refactoring to reduce duplication rather than spreading similar logic across files
- Maintaining a clean, organized codebase structure

This should guide future development decisions about where new functionality belongs.
