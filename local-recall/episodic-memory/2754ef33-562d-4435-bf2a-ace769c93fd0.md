# Claude Transcript Storage Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Folder Naming Convention

Project folders are named using the absolute path with slashes replaced by underscores:
- Path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder name: `_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`

## Structure

Within each project folder:
- `transcripts/` - Contains JSONL files with session transcripts
- Each session has a corresponding `.jsonl` file with conversation history

## Key Details

- Transcripts are in JSONL format (one JSON object per line)
- Each line represents a message/event in the session
- Transcripts can be used by hooks and the MCP server to extract memories
- This is the canonical source for session history
