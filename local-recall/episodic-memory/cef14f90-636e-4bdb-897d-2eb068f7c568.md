On session start, the system performs a **full reload** of all memories, not a delta. The SessionStart hook in `src/hooks/session-start.ts:57-63` creates a fresh MemoryManager instance, calls `listMemories()` to load all memories from disk, then sorts by `occurred_at` descending and takes the 5 most recent for context injection. This happens on every session initiation.

Implication: If there are thousands of memories, this could be slow. Future optimizations could cache recent memories or use a delta approach to only load new/changed memories.
