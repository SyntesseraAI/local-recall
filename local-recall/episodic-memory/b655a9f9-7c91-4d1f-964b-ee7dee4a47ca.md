The Claude CLI response parser handles responses from `claude -p` that may come in different formats. The parser normalizes field names (e.g., `keywords_array` → `keywords`, `applies_to_scope` → `applies_to`) and handles both newline-delimited JSON and standard JSON formats. This is critical for robust memory extraction from Claude's output.
