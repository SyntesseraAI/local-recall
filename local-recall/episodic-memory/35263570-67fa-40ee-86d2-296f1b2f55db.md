The two separate hooks (`user-prompt-submit.ts` and `user-prompt-submit-thinking.ts`) have been merged into a single `user-prompt-submit.ts` hook. This hook now handles both episodic and thinking memory retrieval based on configuration flags. The old `user-prompt-submit-thinking.ts` file has been deleted. This simplifies the hook architecture and allows users to enable/disable episodic and thinking memory independently.
