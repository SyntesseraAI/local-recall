Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files stored in the repository. It integrates via Claude Code plugin system with hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop) and can also function as an MCP server. The system uses fuzzy search with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) for semantic search capabilities.
