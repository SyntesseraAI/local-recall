Transcript condensing is implemented to reduce token usage before sending transcripts to Claude for memory extraction. This involves:

1. Filtering out low-value events (e.g., tool outputs, verbose logging)
2. Compressing verbose tool results while preserving important information
3. Maintaining chronological order and session structure

Condensed transcripts focus on user requests, assistant reasoning, and key tool invocations, making the extraction process more efficient and cost-effective.
