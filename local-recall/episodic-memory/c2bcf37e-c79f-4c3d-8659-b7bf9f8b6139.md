# Transcript Condensing Feature

The Local Recall project implements transcript condensing to abstract raw transcripts into a more meaningful event format for memory extraction.

## Purpose

- Reduces verbosity of raw transcripts from Claude's cache
- Converts detailed conversation into discrete events
- Enables better memory extraction by providing abstracted format
- Improves signal-to-noise ratio for memory creation

## Event Types

Condensed transcripts use these event types:
- `[User]` - User requests and questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

## Implementation

Transcript condensing is handled in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` which:
1. Reads raw JSONL transcript files
2. Extracts relevant events
3. Abstracts verbose details into event format
4. Produces condensed transcript for memory extraction
