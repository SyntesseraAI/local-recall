Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system that enables Claude Code to retain information across sessions. It uses three main integration points: SessionStart hook (loads memory index), UserPromptSubmit hook (searches memories), and an MCP server for CRUD operations. Memory files are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` as markdown files with YAML frontmatter containing metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash).
