SessionStart hook returns 5 most recent memories (sorted by `occurred_at`) without using vector store to avoid slow initialization. UserPromptSubmit hook lazily initializes the vector store (cached) and performs semantic search using the user's prompt. Stop hook is disabled; memory extraction is handled by MCP server daemon running every 5 minutes.
