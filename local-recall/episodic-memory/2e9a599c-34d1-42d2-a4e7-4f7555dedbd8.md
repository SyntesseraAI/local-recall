The codebase has identified a known issue where 'mutex lock failed: Invalid argument' errors occur when multiple processes attempt to load sqlite-vec simultaneously. This is a cross-process synchronization problem. The solution involves implementing cross-process file locking to prevent sqlite-vec mutex errors. See src/mcp-server/server.ts:230 for context.
