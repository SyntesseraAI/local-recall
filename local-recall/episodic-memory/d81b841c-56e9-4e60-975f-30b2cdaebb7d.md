The local-recall/.gitignore file should contain entries to ignore two auto-generated files that should not be version-controlled:
- `index.json` - The keyword index cache that is rebuilt on each session
- `recall.log` - The debug log file

These files are generated at runtime and do not need to be committed to git. The .gitignore is automatically created and maintained by the IndexManager during initialization.
