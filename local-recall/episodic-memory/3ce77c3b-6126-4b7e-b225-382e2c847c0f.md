Claude stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project folders use a URL-encoded path format where slashes are replaced with hyphens (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/` for `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`). Transaction logs are stored in these directories with UUID-based filenames.
