The memory extraction prompt (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) gives Claude detailed instructions on what constitutes a valuable memory. It specifies:
- DO extract: architectural decisions, bug fixes with root cause, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, performance optimizations
- DO NOT extract: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, sensitive data, outdated information
- Each memory should have a brief subject, 1-10 searchable keywords, appropriate scope (global/file/area), and detailed markdown content
- The prompt emphasizes being specific (file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help future assistants)
