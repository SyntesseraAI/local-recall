Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files. Each memory file contains:
- YAML frontmatter with: id (UUID), subject, keywords, applies_to (scope), occurred_at, content_hash
- Markdown content below the frontmatter

Memory files are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` and ARE version-controlled (tracked in git).
