The memory extraction process takes raw transcript data and formats it into distinct sections (User, Assistant, Tool invocations, Results) before sending to Claude Haiku for analysis. This structured formatting ensures consistent memory extraction across different session types and improves Claude's ability to identify meaningful memories from the transcript content.
