Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools via MCP to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. All memories are stored locally within the repository, making them version-controllable and shareable. The system uses YAML frontmatter for metadata and includes features like fuzzy search, memory deduplication, and semantic search via fastembed.
