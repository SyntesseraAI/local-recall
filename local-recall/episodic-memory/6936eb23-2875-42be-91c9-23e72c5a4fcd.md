Memories are deduplicated using a combination of:
1. `occurred_at` timestamp - when the original event occurred
2. `content_hash` - SHA-256 hash prefix (16 chars) of the memory content

This prevents duplicate memories from being created when the same transcript is processed multiple times. The deduplication logic is in src/core/memory.ts findDuplicate() function.
