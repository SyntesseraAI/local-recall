Memory files are stored as markdown with YAML frontmatter containing: `id` (UUID), `subject` (brief description), `keywords` (searchable array), `applies_to` (scope), `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp), and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix). The `content_hash` field is important for deduplication - it prevents duplicate memories from being created even if they arrive at different times.
