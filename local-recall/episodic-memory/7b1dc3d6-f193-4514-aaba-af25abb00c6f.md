When extracting memories from session transcripts, the MemoryExtractor processes condensed transcript format:
- `[User]` - What user asked or requested
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude said or explained
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This condensed format allows the memory extraction prompt to focus on significant events and decisions rather than full transcript text, making analysis more efficient.
