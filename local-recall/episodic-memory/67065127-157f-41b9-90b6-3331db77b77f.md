Memory files are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter metadata in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. These files ARE version-controlled and will be committed to git. The SQLite database (`local-recall/memory.sqlite`) and log files are gitignored and auto-generated. Each memory file contains fields: id (UUID), subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, and content_hash.
