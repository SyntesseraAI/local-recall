Local Recall uses the fastembed library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for generating semantic embeddings. The model is automatically downloaded to local_cache/ on first use and cached there. Initial startup may take 30-60 seconds for the download; subsequent runs load from cache. Vector similarity uses cosine distance with scores 0.0-1.0, rounded to 2 decimal places.
