The keyword extraction in `user-prompt-submit.ts` (lines 37-66) uses Claude Haiku to analyze text and extract relevant keywords. The prompt instructs Claude to identify 5-10 keywords that capture the essence of the text, prioritizing specific keywords over generic ones. Keywords are extracted as a JSON array and used for searching the memory index.
