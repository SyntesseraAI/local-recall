The memory system prevents duplicate memories by using a combination of `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix of memory content) and `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp of when the event occurred). The `findDuplicate()` function checks for existing memories with the same hash and timestamp before creating new ones. This ensures that when the same event/learning is extracted multiple times across different sessions, only one memory is retained.
