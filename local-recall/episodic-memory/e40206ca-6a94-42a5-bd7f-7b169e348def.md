The memory extraction prompt system provides Claude with:
- Clear guidelines on what constitutes valuable memories (architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, conventions)
- Instructions on what NOT to extract (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data)
- Requirements for memory structure (subject, keywords, scope, content)
- Context about the specific codebase being analyzed

Prompts are carefully crafted to ensure consistent, high-quality memory extraction that improves over time.
