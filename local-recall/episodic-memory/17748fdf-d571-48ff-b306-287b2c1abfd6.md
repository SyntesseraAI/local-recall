The memory extraction system uses the Claude API (not local model) to process transcripts and extract structured memories. It uses a prompt template from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide Claude in identifying valuable information from session transcripts. The system sends the transcript content to Claude and parses the returned JSON to create memory objects with proper frontmatter.
