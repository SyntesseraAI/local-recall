Claude stores projects in ~/.claude/projects/ with folder names that convert the full path by replacing forward slashes with dashes. For example, /Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall becomes -Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall. The TranscriptCollector should prioritize this naming convention when searching for projects. Additionally, transcripts are stored directly in the project folder (not in a transcripts/ subfolder), as .jsonl files.
