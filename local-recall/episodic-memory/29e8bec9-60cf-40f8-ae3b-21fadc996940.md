The Stop hook is disabled. Instead, memory extraction is handled by the MCP server running as a background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. This daemon syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, extracts memories using `claude -p`, tracks processed transcripts with content hashes, and handles deduplication by detecting when transcripts change.
