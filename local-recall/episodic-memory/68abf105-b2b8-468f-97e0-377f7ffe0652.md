Alternative embedding solutions investigated: Transformers.js (ONNX-based, likely same mutex issues), TensorFlow.js Universal Sentence Encoder (native backend, similar concurrency issues), Ollama (external API requiring separate service). The core challenge is that Node.js native modules (ONNX, TensorFlow bindings) have global state that causes mutex conflicts when multiple processes load them. Pure JavaScript/WASM solutions or external services may be required.
