Claude Code fetches plugins from Git repositories (e.g., GitHub) and caches them locally. Only files that are committed to Git make it into the plugin distribution. Files in .gitignore are excluded from the plugin cache, even if they exist locally.

This is critical for local-recall: the `dist/` directory must be committed to Git for plugins to work correctly. The .gitignore excludes index files and log files, but the compiled distribution must be tracked.
