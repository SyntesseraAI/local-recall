Memory extraction is handled by the MCP server daemon running in the background (every 5 minutes), not by the Stop hook. The daemon syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, processes them to extract memories, and tracks which transcripts have been processed using content hashes. This prevents duplicate memory creation when transcripts change.
