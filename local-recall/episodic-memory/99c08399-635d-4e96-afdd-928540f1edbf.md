Both `IndexManager` and `MemoryManager` were responsible for creating `.gitignore`, leading to inconsistent initialization. The `.gitignore` should be created by whichever manager is instantiated first. In the current fix, `MemoryManager` is responsible for creating it since it's initialized earlier and represents the core memory functionality. The `IndexManager` should not duplicate this logic.
