# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full transcript path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (JSON Lines format):
- Each line is a complete JSON object representing an event
- Common event types: `user_message`, `assistant_message`, `tool_result`
- Timestamp field: `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 format)
- Tool results include: `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `tool_result` fields

## Processing

When extracting memories from transcripts, parse as JSONL and iterate line by line. Each line may contain nested tool information that needs to be extracted separately.
