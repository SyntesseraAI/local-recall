The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API with streaming to process transcripts efficiently. The `MemoryExtractor` class handles the extraction workflow, utilizing prompt templates from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide Claude in identifying valuable memories from session transcripts. Streaming allows for real-time processing of large transcripts without loading the entire response into memory at once.
