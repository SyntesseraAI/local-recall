The error "Tokenizer file not found at local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json" indicates a corrupted or incomplete model cache, usually from an interrupted download.

Fix: Remove the corrupted cache with `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` - the model will automatically re-download on next run.

This typically happens when the first run is interrupted while downloading the ~133MB BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model.
