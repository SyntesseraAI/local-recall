The project root serves as the plugin root following Claude Code's plugin format. Hooks are configured in `hooks.json` using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for relative references. Built scripts go in `scripts/` (gitignored) with subdirectories for `hooks/` and `mcp-server/`. Hooks receive `cwd` via stdin to operate on the user's project directory.
