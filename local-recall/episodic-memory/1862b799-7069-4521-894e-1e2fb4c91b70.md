The memory-extractor.ts module is responsible for processing transcripts and creating memories. It uses the Claude API (via `anthropic` package) to analyze transcripts and extract valuable information. Key functions:

- `extractMemoriesFromTranscript()` - Main function that takes a transcript and returns extracted memories
- Uses token counting via `countTokens()` to manage API call efficiency
- Processes transcript chunks to stay within token limits
- Creates Memory objects with proper metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash)

The module integrates with the memory.ts module to persist extracted memories to disk.
