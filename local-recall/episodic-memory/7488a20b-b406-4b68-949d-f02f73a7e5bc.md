The memory extraction system in memory-extractor.ts uses the Claude API with structured output (JSON schema) to generate memories from transcripts. This ensures consistent, parseable memory objects with all required fields (subject, keywords, applies_to, content). The extractor handles batching and validates the response schema matches expectations.
