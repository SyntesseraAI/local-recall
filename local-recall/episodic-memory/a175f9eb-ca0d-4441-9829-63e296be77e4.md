The memory extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` provides detailed guidelines for analyzing transcripts. It specifies what should and shouldn't be extracted (e.g., extract architectural decisions and bug fixes, but don't extract generic programming knowledge). The prompt emphasizes being specific with file paths and function names, concise with one concept per memory, and actionable so future assistants can benefit.
