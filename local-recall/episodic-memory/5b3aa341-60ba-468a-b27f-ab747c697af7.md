Rather than creating a separate hook or mechanism for .gitignore generation, the functionality was integrated into the existing `getIndex()` call that happens during session start. This is efficient because:

1. The session-start hook already calls `searchEngine.getRelevantForSession()` which calls `indexManager.getIndex()`
2. This means `.gitignore` is created automatically as part of normal initialization
3. No additional system calls or hooks are needed
4. The pattern works whether the index exists or not

This demonstrates a design principle: leverage existing initialization flows rather than adding parallel initialization mechanisms.
