The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model via the `claude -p` command to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. The extraction is driven by a structured prompt defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides the model to identify:

- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

The prompt explicitly excludes generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, and sensitive data. This allows the extraction to be highly focused and actionable.
