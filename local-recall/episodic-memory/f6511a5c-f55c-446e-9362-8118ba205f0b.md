# Memory Extraction from User Prompts

The transcript collector extracts memories when it encounters user prompts in the transcript data.

## Process

1. Collector reads JSONL transcript files from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
2. Identifies events with `type: 'user_prompt'`
3. For each user prompt, extracts valuable memories
4. Creates memory files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`

## Key Points

- User prompts are triggers for memory creation
- This happens during transcript processing
- Memories are extracted from the context around these prompts
- The extraction should consider what was learned or changed
