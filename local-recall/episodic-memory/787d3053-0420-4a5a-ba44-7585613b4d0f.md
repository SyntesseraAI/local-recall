The project uses a dedicated system prompt file at `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that defines how Claude should extract memories from transcripts. The prompt instructs Claude to return a JSON object with a 'memories' array, where each memory has: subject (brief one-line description), keywords (array of searchable keywords), applies_to (scope: global, file path, or area name), and content (detailed markdown description).
