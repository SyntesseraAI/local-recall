The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) to analyze condensed session transcripts and extract valuable memories. The process involves:

1. Condensing transcripts into structured events ([User], [Assistant], [Tool], [Result])
2. Passing the condensed transcript to Haiku with specific extraction guidelines
3. Haiku returns structured memories as JSON

The memory extractor is located in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` and uses `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` for the extraction prompt template.
