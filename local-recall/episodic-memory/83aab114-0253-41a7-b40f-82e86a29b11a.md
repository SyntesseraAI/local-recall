# Memory Extraction Guidelines

When extracting memories from transcripts, focus on:
1. **Architectural decisions** - Why certain patterns were chosen
2. **Bug fixes** - Root causes and solutions
3. **Code patterns** - Conventions specific to this project
4. **Configuration quirks** - Gotchas and workarounds
5. **Component relationships** - How different parts interact

Avoid extracting:
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

Each memory should be specific, concise, and actionable.
