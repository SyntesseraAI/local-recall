The memory system prevents duplicates through `MemoryManager.findDuplicate(occurredAt, contentHash)` which checks for existing memories with the same timestamp and SHA-256 hash prefix. Memory creation operations are idempotent - attempting to create a duplicate returns the existing memory instead of creating a new one. This prevents memory bloat from repeated transcripts.
