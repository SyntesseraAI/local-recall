Local Recall is a persistent memory layer for Claude Code and MCP-compatible tools. Memories are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory and are version-controlled. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings (via fastembed and BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic search capabilities.
