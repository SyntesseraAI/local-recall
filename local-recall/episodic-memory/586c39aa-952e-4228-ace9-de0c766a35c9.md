# Extracting Memories from Transcripts

## What Makes Good Memories

Good memories from transcripts include:
- **Bug fixes**: Problems that were discovered and solved, with root cause analysis
- **Architectural decisions**: Why certain patterns or approaches were chosen
- **Code patterns**: Specific conventions or patterns used in this codebase
- **Configuration quirks**: Special setup or gotchas discovered
- **Performance insights**: Optimizations that were applied
- **Integration details**: How components work together

## What NOT to Extract

- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps that aren't long-term useful
- Obvious or trivial information
- Information that changes frequently
- Sensitive data

## Key Insight

Focus on **concrete, specific details** from actual tool invocations:
- Actual file paths and function names from code changes
- Specific error messages and their solutions
- Real configuration values or paths discovered
- Actual code patterns seen in the files

Not on generic summaries or high-level observations.
