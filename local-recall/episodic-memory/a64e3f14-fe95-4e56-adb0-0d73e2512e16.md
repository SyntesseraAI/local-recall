# Memory Extraction Keyword Extraction

The transcript processing pipeline uses Claude Haiku to extract keywords from condensed transcripts.

## Process

1. Transcripts are condensed into simplified event format
2. Condensed transcript is sent to Claude Haiku for keyword extraction
3. Keywords are used to create searchable memory entries
4. Memories are stored with extracted keywords for fuzzy search capability

## Implementation

This is part of the async MCP server daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes, as described in CLAUDE.md's "Background Daemon" section.
