# Fuzzy Search Configuration

The Local Recall search system uses fuzzy matching to find memories by keywords.

## Default Configuration

- **Fuzzy Threshold**: 0.6 (60% match required)
- This is a reasonable default that balances precision and recall
- Can be configured via environment variables or `.local-recall.json`

## How It Works

When searching for memories:
1. Extract keywords from the query
2. Compare each keyword against indexed keywords using fuzzy matching
3. Return matches that score above the threshold (0.6)
4. Results are ranked by match quality

## Configuration Location

See `src/core/search.ts` for implementation details and configurable thresholds.
