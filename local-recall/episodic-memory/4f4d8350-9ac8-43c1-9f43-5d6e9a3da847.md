Memory creation includes a `content_hash` field (SHA-256 prefix, 16 chars) to detect duplicate memories. The `findDuplicate()` function checks both `occurred_at` timestamp and `content_hash` to prevent creating the same memory twice. This is essential for the daemon which processes transcripts periodically - transcripts that haven't changed (same content hash) should not generate new memories.
