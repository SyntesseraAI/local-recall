The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. The MemoryExtractor class processes transcripts through a two-phase system:

1. **Transcript Condensing**: Reduces verbose transcripts to key events
2. **Memory Extraction**: Uses Claude Haiku with structured prompts to identify memories

The system uses a MemoryExtractionPrompt with specific templates in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide the extraction process. This runs in the MCP server background daemon to process transcripts asynchronously.
