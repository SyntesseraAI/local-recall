The system implements transcript condensing to reduce token usage when extracting memories. Raw transcripts are first condensed into a compact format (events with [User], [Assistant], [Tool], [Result] markers) before being passed to the memory extraction model. This optimization reduces API calls while maintaining necessary context for memory creation.
