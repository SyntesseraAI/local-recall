When extracting memories from transcripts, the project context and working directory are essential for determining the appropriate scope. Memories should use `applies_to` field with `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>` to indicate relevance. The working directory (`/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`) helps determine whether memories are global or specific to certain files/areas.
