The BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) is automatically downloaded on first use and cached in `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`. The first startup takes 30-60 seconds for model download, but subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file error occurs, delete the corrupted cache directory and the model will re-download automatically.
