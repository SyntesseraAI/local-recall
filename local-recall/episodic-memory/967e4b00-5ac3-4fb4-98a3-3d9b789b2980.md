Memory extraction should follow these guidelines: Be specific (include file paths, function names, concrete details), be concise (one concept per memory), and be actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes). Use appropriate scope: 'global' for codebase-wide knowledge, 'file:<path>' for file-specific information, and 'area:<name>' for component-related memories. Extract architectural decisions, bug fixes with root cause analysis, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, and performance optimizations. Avoid extracting generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, sensitive data, or quickly-outdated information.
