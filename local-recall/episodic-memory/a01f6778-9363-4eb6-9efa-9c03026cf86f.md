# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format):
- One event per line
- Each event is a complete JSON object
- Files are named with timestamps or session IDs

## Usage in Local Recall

The transcript-collector module reads from this location to:
- Extract memories from completed sessions
- Identify memory extraction patterns
- Process transcript events for analysis

This is critical for the MCP server daemon's background transcript processing that creates memories automatically.
