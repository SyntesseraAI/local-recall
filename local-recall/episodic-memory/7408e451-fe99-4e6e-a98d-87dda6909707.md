The memory extraction prompt (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) provides Claude Haiku with detailed instructions on how to extract memories from transcripts. It specifies the exact JSON structure that should be returned, including fields for id (UUID), subject (brief description), keywords (searchable terms), applies_to (scope), occurred_at (ISO timestamp), and content (memory details). This prompt is critical for ensuring consistent, structured memory extraction.
