The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku via `claude -p` command to generate keywords from transcripts. The extraction process:

1. Takes condensed transcript events as input
2. Uses prompt templates from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide Claude's analysis
3. Generates keywords for searchability and memory categorization
4. Creates structured memories with metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash)

Key files:
- `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` - Main extraction logic
- `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` - Prompt templates for extraction

The approach ensures consistent, high-quality memory extraction guided by well-crafted prompts.
