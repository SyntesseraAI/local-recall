The Stop hook is currently disabled. Memory extraction is now handled by an asynchronous MCP server daemon that:
- Runs every 5 minutes
- Processes transcripts from Claude's cache
- Extracts memories using a dedicated memory extraction process
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection

This approach avoids blocking the user's session and allows for more sophisticated memory extraction without interrupting the coding workflow.
