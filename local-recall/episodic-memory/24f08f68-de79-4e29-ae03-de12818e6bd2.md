The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku (via `claude -p` process invocation) to analyze transcripts and extract memories. It uses a structured prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that provides detailed guidelines for what memories to extract and how to format them as JSON. The extractor invokes the Claude process, parses JSON output, and handles any extraction failures gracefully.
