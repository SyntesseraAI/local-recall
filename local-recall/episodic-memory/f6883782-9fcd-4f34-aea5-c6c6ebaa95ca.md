The codebase uses `fastembed` library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic embeddings. Vector similarity search is implemented using `better-sqlite3` with the `sqlite-vec` extension for cosine distance calculation. The embedding model is cached in `local_cache/` directory. Scores are cosine distances ranging 0.0-1.0, rounded to 2 decimal places.
