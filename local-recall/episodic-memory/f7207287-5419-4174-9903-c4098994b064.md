The memory extractor's `callClaudeCLI` method explicitly uses the Haiku model (`--model haiku`) instead of relying on the default model. This optimization reduces costs while maintaining extraction quality. Haiku successfully extracts valuable memories from transcripts despite being a smaller model.
