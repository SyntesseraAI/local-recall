Transcripts are condensed into compact event format before being sent to Claude for memory extraction. This reduces token usage and focuses the analysis on essential information. The condensed format includes: [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], and [Result: OK/ERROR] events. This compression is critical for cost-effective batch processing of transcripts by the background daemon.
