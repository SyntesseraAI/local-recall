Thinking memory files are being actively created and stored in the local-recall system. These files capture Claude's reasoning (thought blocks) paired with the actual output produced, creating valuable examples of "how I reasoned → what I produced" for future sessions.

**Key aspects:**
- 8 thinking memory files were added in this session
- Files are stored in `local-recall/thinking-memory/`
- Each file contains a thought section and an output section
- These are version-controlled and tracked in git (unlike vector indexes which are gitignored)
- The system extracts these from transcripts automatically

This pattern helps future AI assistants understand not just what was done, but the reasoning behind decisions and implementations.
