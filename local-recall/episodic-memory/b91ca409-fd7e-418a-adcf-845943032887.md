Transcript condensing reduces verbose transcripts to event-based summaries to improve token efficiency for memory extraction. The condensed format represents the transcript as events: `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]`. This approach allows the MCP server to summarize longer sessions before passing them to Claude for memory extraction, reducing processing time and token costs while preserving essential information needed to identify actionable memories.
