The user has made it clear that extracting valuable memories from Claude Code session transcripts is the primary focus for future work. This is the core purpose of the local-recall plugin - to retain knowledge across sessions.

Key points:
- Memory extraction should be automatic and reliable
- Memories should capture important insights, patterns, and decisions
- The transcript-collector component is critical for this functionality
- Future sessions should leverage extracted memories to work more efficiently

This context is important for prioritizing development work and ensuring the memory system functions effectively.
