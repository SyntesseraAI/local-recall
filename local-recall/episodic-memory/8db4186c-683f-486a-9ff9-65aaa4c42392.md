The memory extractor includes transcript condensing functionality to reduce the number of tokens sent to Claude API:

- Large transcripts are condensed before being sent to the extraction prompt
- Condensing preserves essential information while removing redundancy
- This optimization helps stay within token limits and reduces API costs
- Implemented in the memory-extractor module for easy access by extraction logic
