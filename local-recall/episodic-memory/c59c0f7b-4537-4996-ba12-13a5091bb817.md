The current git branch is `claude/refactor-memory-collection-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`, indicating an active refactoring effort focused on memory collection.

Recent commits show:
- Standardizing string quotes and improving logging consistency (user-prompt-submit hook)
- Renaming memories directory to episodic-memory across the project
- Implementing transcript condensing for memory extraction
- Enhancing memory extraction and logging functionality
- Removing created_at field and sorting by occurred_at

Multiple files have been modified including core components (memory.ts, memory-extractor.ts, search.ts) and hooks. This refactoring is still in progress.
