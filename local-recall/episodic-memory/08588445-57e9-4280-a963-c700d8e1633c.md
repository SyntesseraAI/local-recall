To handle large session transcripts that may exceed token limits when sent to Claude, a transcript condensing feature was implemented. This allows the memory extraction process to:

1. Condense verbose transcripts into a more compact format
2. Preserve essential information while removing redundancy
3. Stay within API token limits when processing with Claude Haiku
4. Maintain the semantic meaning needed for keyword extraction

This is particularly important for longer sessions where the full transcript might be too large to process in a single API call.
