Changed thinking memory extraction to capture both the thinking block AND the corresponding text output in a single memory. Format is: ## Thought\n\n{thinking}\n\n## Output\n\n{output}. Tool-only responses are now skipped (memories are only created when there's text output). This provides concrete examples of 'how I reasoned → what I produced' for future sessions.
