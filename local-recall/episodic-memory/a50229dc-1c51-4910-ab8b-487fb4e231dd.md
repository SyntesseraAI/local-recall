Local Recall uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic embeddings. The model auto-downloads to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use (30-60 seconds). If tokenizer.json is missing or corrupted, clearing `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and re-running allows re-download. This is a known troubleshooting step for model cache corruption.
