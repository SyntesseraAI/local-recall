Claude Code stores transcripts for each project in `~/.claude/projects/` using a hashed version of the project path as the folder name. The transcript collector uses multiple strategies to find them:

1. **Primary**: Direct path lookup using hashed project path
2. **Fallback**: Scan all directories and check for matching project paths
3. **Last resort**: Look for directories ending with hashed path suffix

This three-tier approach ensures transcripts are found even if the hashing algorithm or directory structure varies.
