# User Preference: Avoid Unnecessary File Creation

The project instructions emphasize a strong preference for editing existing files rather than creating new ones.

## Key Principle

From CLAUDE.md:
> "ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required."

## Application

When working on this codebase:
- Only create new files if absolutely necessary for the task
- Refactor and reorganize existing files instead of creating new utility files
- Consolidate related functionality in existing modules
- Use this principle for all development work

## Reasoning

This keeps the codebase structure clean and reduces file proliferation, making it easier to understand and maintain.
