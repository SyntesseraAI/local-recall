Local Recall uses the fastembed library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use. Initial startup may take 30-60 seconds during first run while the model downloads. Subsequent runs load from cache. If the tokenizer file is corrupted, delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to force re-download on next run.
