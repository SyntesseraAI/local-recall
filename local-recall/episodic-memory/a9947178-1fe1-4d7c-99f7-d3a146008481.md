# Local Recall User Preferences

## Key Preferences

1. **Avoid over-engineering**: Only make changes directly requested or clearly necessary
2. **Keep solutions simple and focused**: Don't add features, refactor, or make "improvements" beyond scope
3. **Comprehensive testing and documentation**: All new features must have unit tests and documentation
4. **Avoid redundancy**: Don't create helpers/utilities for one-time operations
5. **Trust internal code**: Don't add error handling for scenarios that can't happen

## Project Structure

The project uses:
- TypeScript for type safety
- YAML frontmatter in memory files for metadata
- Markdown for memory file content
- JSONL format for transcripts
- Standard npm scripts: build, dev, test, lint

## Memory System Conventions

- Memory files are version-controlled (tracked in git)
- The index (`local-recall/index.json`) is gitignored
- Each memory should be atomic (one concept per file)
- Use specific keywords for searchability
- Consider scope carefully: `global` vs `file:` vs `area:`
