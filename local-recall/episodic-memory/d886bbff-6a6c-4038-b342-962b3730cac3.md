Claude stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The project folder naming convention encodes the absolute path by replacing `/` with `-`: `/Users/joe/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/` corresponds to the project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`. Transcript files are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) in the `transcripts/` subdirectory. This is critical for the MCP daemon that syncs and processes transcripts asynchronously.
