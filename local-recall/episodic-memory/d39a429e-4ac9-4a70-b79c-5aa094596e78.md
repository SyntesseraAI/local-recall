The memory-extractor.ts module uses Claude Haiku (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001) as the LLM for analyzing transcripts and extracting memories. This choice is intentional for token efficiency, as Haiku is more cost-effective than larger models while still capable of understanding context and identifying key insights from session transcripts.
