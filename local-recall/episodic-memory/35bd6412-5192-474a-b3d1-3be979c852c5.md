The `analyzeForMemories()` function in `src/utils/transcript.ts` was refactored to remove all filtering logic:

## Changes Made

1. **Removed** `USER_TRIGGER_PATTERNS` - previously matched phrases like "remember this", "save this for later", "don't forget", etc.

2. **Removed** `AUTO_DETECT_PATTERNS` - previously detected patterns like architecture decisions, bugfixes, discoveries, and conventions

3. **Simplified behavior** - now saves every message from the transcript:
   - Skips only empty messages
   - Formats each message with role prefix (`**user**:` or `**assistant**:`)
   - No semantic filtering or heuristic-based selection

This change means all conversation content is now preserved in memory rather than using selective filtering based on trigger phrases or auto-detected patterns.
