The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model with streaming responses and token counting. The `MemoryExtractor` class has methods like `extractMemories()` that process transcripts and extract structured memories. Uses `stream()` method for streaming responses and `countTokens()` for token management. The extraction is designed to be efficient for processing session transcripts.
