Hooks should wrap main logic in try-catch blocks and log errors to the logger instead of letting exceptions propagate silently. This helps with debugging since hook execution happens in the background. Errors should be logged with context about what operation failed, and the hook should attempt to continue gracefully rather than crashing completely.
