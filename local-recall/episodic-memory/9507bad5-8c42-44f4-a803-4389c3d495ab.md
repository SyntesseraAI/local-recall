The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the `claude -p` command to invoke Claude Haiku for analyzing transcripts. The extraction process:

1. Takes a transcript as input
2. Sends it to Claude Haiku via `claude -p` with a structured prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`
3. Parses Claude's response to extract memories
4. Returns an array of structured memory objects

This is a key component of the async memory creation pipeline that processes transcripts for memory extraction.
