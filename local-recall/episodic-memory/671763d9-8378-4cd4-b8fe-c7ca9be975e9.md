# Transcript Filtering Strategy

When implementing transcript collection and processing for memory extraction, avoid processing temporary or non-relevant files.

## What to Exclude

- Files that are obviously temporary or incomplete
- Transcripts that don't contain meaningful interactions
- Extremely short or minimal transcripts that lack substance
- Duplicate or superseded transcript versions

## Implementation Notes

- The MCP server daemon scans `~/.claude/projects/{project}/transcripts/`
- It should intelligently filter which transcripts to process
- Only transcripts with valuable content should be analyzed
- Use content hashes to detect duplicates and avoid reprocessing

## Benefits

- Reduces noise in memory creation
- Improves efficiency by not processing useless transcripts
- Helps maintain a higher quality memory database
- Prevents memory pollution with trivial or temporary information
