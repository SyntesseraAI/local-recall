The system uses `claude -p` (Claude Haiku in project mode) to process transcripts and extract memories. This is used in the UserPromptSubmit hook for keyword extraction and in the MCP server background daemon for creating memories from session transcripts. The prompt mode is lightweight and suitable for processing structured data.
