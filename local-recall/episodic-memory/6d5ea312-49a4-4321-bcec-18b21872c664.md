Local Recall can be installed as:
1. **Claude Code Plugin** - Project root is plugin root with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
2. **npm package** - Added to `.claude/settings.json` with hook commands and MCP server config
3. **Direct hooks** - Hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json` pointing to bundled scripts

Hooks use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for relative paths and receive `cwd` via stdin to operate on user's project directory.
