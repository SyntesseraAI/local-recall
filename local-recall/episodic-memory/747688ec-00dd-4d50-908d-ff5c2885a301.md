# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Slashes (`/`) are replaced with underscores (`_`)
- Leading/trailing underscores are stripped
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`

## Transcript Files

- Format: JSONL (JSON Lines) files
- Located in: `~/.claude/projects/{folder-name}/transcripts/`
- Each line is a complete JSON object representing a transcript event
- New transcripts are appended to files as the session progresses

## Implementation Details

The `transcript-collector.ts` handles syncing these transcripts. When collecting transcripts:
1. Compute the project folder name from the working directory path
2. Read JSONL files from the transcripts directory
3. Each line can be parsed independently as JSON
4. Track file modification times for detecting new transcripts
