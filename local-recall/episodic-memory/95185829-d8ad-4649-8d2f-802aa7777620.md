Transcripts are condensed before being sent to memory extraction. This condensing step:
- Reduces token count by removing noise and redundant information
- Preserves key events and decisions that matter for memory creation
- Makes the extraction prompt more focused and efficient

This is a critical preprocessing step that happens before the memory-extractor processes the transcript.
