Local Recall uses the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) for semantic search via fastembed library. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use. First startup may take 30-60 seconds while the model downloads. Subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file is missing, remove the corrupted cache directory and it will re-download automatically.
