The `syncTranscripts()` method in transcript-collector.ts previously copied synthetic transcripts from Claude's cache before cleaning them up, causing unnecessary I/O. This was optimized to check `isSyntheticFile(transcript.sourcePath)` before copying, skipping synthetic transcripts entirely. The `cleanupTranscripts()` call still runs first to remove any previously copied synthetic files as a safety measure.
