# Memory Scope System

Local Recall supports three scope types in the `applies_to` field:

1. **global** - Memory applies to the entire project, relevant across all files
2. **file:<path>** - Memory specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
3. **area:<name>** - Memory related to a component or architectural area (e.g., `area:transcript-processing`, `area:memory-indexing`)

## Usage in Hooks

Both SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks consider the current file context when searching for memories. Scoped memories help surface only relevant context without overwhelming the assistant with unrelated information.

## Examples

- **Global memories**: Architecture decisions, project conventions, general best practices
- **File-scoped memories**: Specific implementation details, known issues in that file
- **Area-scoped memories**: Component-specific patterns, interdependencies between modules
