The memory extractor module uses Claude Haiku model (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) to extract keywords from session transcripts. This is used during memory creation to populate the `keywords` field. The extraction process is handled by the `extractKeywords()` function which sends the transcript content to Claude with a specific prompt format.
