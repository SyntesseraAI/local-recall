Implemented vector store for semantic search using the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model via the `fastembed` library. This enables finding memories based on semantic similarity, not just keyword matching. The model is cached locally (~133MB) and downloaded automatically on first use. Future searches can use `searchBySemantic()` for more intelligent memory retrieval based on context.
