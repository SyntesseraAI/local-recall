Transcripts are condensed before being sent to the memory extraction prompt. This condensing process (likely in transcript-collector.ts) reduces verbosity while maintaining the key events and decisions from a session. The condensed format uses [User], [Assistant], [Tool], and [Result] markers to create a structured summary suitable for analysis.
