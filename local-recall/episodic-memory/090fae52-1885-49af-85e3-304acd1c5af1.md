The thinking index implementation revealed that episodic memory should default to OFF and thinking memory should default to ON. This suggests:

1. **Thinking memory is more reliable/useful** - It captures actual reasoning patterns and outputs which appear more actionable than episodic memories
2. **Episodic memories may have issues** - The user explicitly wanted to disable episodic by default, suggesting quality or relevance concerns
3. **Independent control is important** - Users need granular control to enable/disable each memory type independently based on their use case

This design reflects a preference for reasoning examples (thinking) over factual memory (episodic) as the primary memory source.
