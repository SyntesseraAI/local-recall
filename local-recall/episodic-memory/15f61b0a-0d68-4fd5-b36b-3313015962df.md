The `ThinkingExtractor` class was fully implemented (lines 103-310 of `thinking-extractor.ts`) with methods like `extractThinkingFromTranscript()` to parse Claude's thinking blocks and pair them with outputs. However, the `runThinkingExtraction()` function was never being invoked by the MCP server daemon, meaning thinking memories were not being automatically processed from transcripts despite the feature being conceptually complete.
