The Stop hook is disabled. Memory extraction from transcripts is handled by the MCP server running as a background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. This allows memory extraction to happen without blocking the hook execution. The memory-extractor.ts module contains the logic for parsing transcripts and creating memories.
