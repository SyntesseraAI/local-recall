# Session Transcript Already Available During Memory Extraction

When analyzing a Claude Code session transcript for memory extraction, the session transcript is **already provided as input** to the memory extraction process.

## Context

- The `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` message indicates the memory extraction phase
- The transcript being analyzed comes from the CURRENT session
- This means memories should be extracted from what just happened in this session

## Implication

When receiving `LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL` markers in prompts, the AI assistant should:
1. Recognize this as a signal that it's in the memory extraction phase
2. Analyze the provided transcript to identify valuable memories
3. Focus on extracting codebase-specific knowledge and session learnings
4. Not attempt to fetch transcripts from external sources - the input is already complete
