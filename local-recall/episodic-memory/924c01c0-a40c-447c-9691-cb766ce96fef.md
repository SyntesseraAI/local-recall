The user requires that multiple Claude Code instances can run concurrently. This rules out daemon approaches that would conflict on ports or file locks. Instead, embedding services should be externalized (Ollama) or hooks should use text-based search only. Each Claude instance can have its own MCP server, but shared embedding infrastructure (like Ollama) prevents the ONNX concurrency problem entirely.
