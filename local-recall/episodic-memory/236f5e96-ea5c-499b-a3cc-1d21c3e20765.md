# Claude Code Transcript Storage

Claude Code stores session transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` with URL-encoded project directory names:

- Base path: `~/.claude/projects/`
- Project directory names are URL-encoded versions of the full project path
- Transcript files are stored as `.jsonl` files (newline-delimited JSON)
- Each line represents a single turn in the conversation
- This is how the transcript collector daemon locates and processes transcripts for memory extraction
