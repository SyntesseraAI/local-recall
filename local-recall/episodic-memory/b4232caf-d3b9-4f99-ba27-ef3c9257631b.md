The memory extraction system expects condensed transcripts using event markers:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude responses
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool outcomes

This format allows the extractor to parse transcript events and extract meaningful memories about what was learned, fixed, or discovered during the session.
