The memory-extractor.ts module uses the Claude API (via claude-sdk) to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. It employs a prompt-based approach with a system prompt defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts that guides Claude to identify and structure memories with proper YAML frontmatter. The extracted memories are then created via the memory manager, with duplicate detection based on occurred_at timestamp and content_hash to ensure idempotent memory creation.
