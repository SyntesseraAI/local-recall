The MemoryExtractor class in src/core/memory-extractor.ts uses Claude Haiku via the MCP client to extract memories from condensed transcripts. The prompt is defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts and guides the model to identify valuable memories based on specific criteria:

- What was learned or discovered
- Important facts about the codebase
- Codebase-specific patterns and configurations
- Problems that were solved

The extraction process takes transcript content and returns structured memories with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content. This is part of the background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously.
