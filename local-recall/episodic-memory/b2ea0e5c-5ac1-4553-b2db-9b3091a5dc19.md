The project includes a CLAUDE.md file that documents project instructions, architecture, and user preferences. These instructions define how the codebase should be worked with and include requirements like:
- Never creating new files unless necessary
- Preferring to edit existing files
- Using TodoWrite for task tracking
- Following specific code patterns and conventions

These preferences should be referenced when extracting memories to ensure consistency across sessions.
