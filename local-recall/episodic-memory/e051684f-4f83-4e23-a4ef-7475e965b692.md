# Path Conversion for Transcript Collector

The transcript collector module needs a robust path conversion utility to handle cross-platform path differences.

## Current Implementation Issue

The current path conversion logic may need enhancement for Windows compatibility:
- macOS/Linux: Uses `/` as path separator, needs conversion to `-`
- Windows: Uses `\` as path separator, also needs conversion to `-`

## Recommendation

Create a dedicated utility function (e.g., `convertPathToProjectFolderName()`) that:
1. Takes an absolute path as input
2. Normalizes path separators to forward slashes (handles Windows `\` correctly)
3. Replaces all forward slashes with dashes
4. Returns the standardized project folder name

This utility should be:
- Exported from a utilities module for reuse
- Thoroughly tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux paths
- Used consistently in both transcript-collector and anywhere paths are converted to project folder names
