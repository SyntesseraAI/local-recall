The Local Recall project root IS the plugin root. Hooks are configured in `hooks.json` and use the `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` variable to reference bundled scripts in `scripts/hooks/` and `scripts/mcp-server/`. This allows the plugin to be installed in any location while still finding its resources.

Hooks receive `cwd` via stdin to operate on the user's project directory, not the plugin directory.
