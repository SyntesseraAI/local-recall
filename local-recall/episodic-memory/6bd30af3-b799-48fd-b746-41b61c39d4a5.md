The memory extraction process includes a transcript condensing step that prepares transcripts before memory extraction. This is defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and handles:
- Reducing transcript size while preserving relevant information
- Formatting transcripts in a standardized way for memory extraction
- Ensuring memories are extracted from well-structured input

The condensed transcript format uses events like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]` to represent session activity.
