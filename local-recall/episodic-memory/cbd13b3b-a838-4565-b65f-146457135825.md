The memory extraction process explicitly avoids storing: generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this), temporary debugging steps, obvious/trivial information, sensitive data (API keys, passwords), and information that would become outdated quickly. This keeps memories focused on codebase-specific, actionable insights.
