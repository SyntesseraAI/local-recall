Claude projects are stored in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The directory naming follows a pattern where special characters (like slashes) are replaced with hyphens. For example, the project path `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` maps to a project directory with an equivalent hash-based or path-based identifier. This is important for understanding how Claude Code stores project-specific data like transcripts and configurations.
