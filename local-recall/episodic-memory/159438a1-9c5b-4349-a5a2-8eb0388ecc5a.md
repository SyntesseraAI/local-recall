# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Project: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line) in the `transcripts/` subdirectory. Each line contains:
- `role`: Either "user" or "assistant"
- `content`: The message content
- `timestamp`: ISO-8601 timestamp

## Implementation Details

The `transcript-collector.ts` module handles collecting transcripts from this location:
- Resolves the path-encoded folder name from the absolute project path
- Reads all JSONL files from the transcripts directory
- Parses each line as a separate JSON object

This is used by the MCP server daemon to process transcripts for memory extraction.
