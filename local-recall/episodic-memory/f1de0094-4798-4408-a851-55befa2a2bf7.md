Data flows into the SQLite vector store through three mechanisms:

1. **Immediate Creation**: When `MemoryManager.createMemory()` is called, the memory is written to disk, then immediately added to the vector store with `vectorStore.add(memory)`, which generates embedding and inserts into SQLite

2. **Explicit Sync**: The `vectorStore.sync(memories)` method (called from MCP server at `src/mcp-server/server.ts:73`) reconciles the in-memory state with disk files, adding missing memories and removing deleted ones

3. **Daemon Background**: The MCP server runs a background daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes, extracts new memories using Claude, and adds them via the creation pathway

This multi-pathway design ensures memories are available immediately when created while also catching any stale or missing data through periodic syncs.
