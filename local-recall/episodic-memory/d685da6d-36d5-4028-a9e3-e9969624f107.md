The memory extraction system is a critical component of Local Recall's architecture. It automatically processes session transcripts to identify and store valuable memories that help future AI assistants maintain context. This enables the system to build a persistent knowledge base from Claude Code sessions, allowing subsequent sessions to benefit from previous discoveries and decisions.
