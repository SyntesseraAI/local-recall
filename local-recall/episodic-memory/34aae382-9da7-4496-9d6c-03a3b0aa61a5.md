# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The project implements transcript condensing to reduce token usage when using Claude to extract memories from transcripts.

## Implementation Details

- Condenses verbose transcripts into a compact event-based format
- Events are represented as: `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, `[Result: OK/ERROR]`
- Reduces token count from full transcript while preserving essential information
- Used in the MCP server background daemon for processing transcripts

## Location

Implementation is in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` with modifications tracked in git.

## Purpose

This condensing allows the system to extract memories more efficiently by:
1. Reducing the number of tokens sent to Claude for memory extraction
2. Preserving the essential information about what happened in the session
3. Making transcript processing faster and cheaper
