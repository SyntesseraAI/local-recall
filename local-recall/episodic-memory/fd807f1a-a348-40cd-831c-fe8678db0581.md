Memory extraction prompts are defined in a separate `memory-extraction.ts` module under `src/prompts/`. This centralized approach allows for easy maintenance and iteration on the prompts used to guide Claude in extracting relevant memories from transcripts. The prompts likely contain instructions for identifying what makes a valuable memory and how to structure the extracted information.
