The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku via `claude -p` command to analyze transcripts and extract memories. The extraction prompt is stored separately in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` rather than being hardcoded, allowing for consistent prompt management and easy updates without changing the core extraction logic. This separation of concerns follows the project's architectural pattern.
