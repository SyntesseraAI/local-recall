Local Recall uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search embeddings.

- Model automatically downloads to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use
- First run takes 30-60 seconds while model downloads, subsequent runs load from cache
- If encountering "Tokenizer file not found" error, remove corrupted cache: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and model will re-download
- Vector store caches embeddings in SQLite for efficient similarity search
- SessionStart hook skips vector store to avoid slow initialization on session start
