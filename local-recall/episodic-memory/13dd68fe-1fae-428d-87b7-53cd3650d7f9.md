Local Recall maintains version information in two places: (1) `package.json` for npm package distribution and (2) `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` for Claude Code marketplace distribution. Both must be updated in sync when releasing new versions. The package.json is the primary source of truth, and marketplace.json should mirror it.
