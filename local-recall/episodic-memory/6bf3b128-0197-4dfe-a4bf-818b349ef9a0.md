The memory extraction prompt is defined in a separate module (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) rather than inline. This enables:

- Centralized prompt management
- Easy iteration and testing of prompt improvements
- Separation of concerns between prompt logic and extraction logic
- Reusability across different memory extraction contexts

Future improvements should update the prompt module to refine memory extraction quality.
