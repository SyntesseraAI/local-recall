# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

When extracting memories from transcripts, the system uses transcript condensing to reduce token usage.

## Why Condensing Matters

Full transcripts can be very large and expensive to process with Claude API. Condensing reduces tokens while preserving key information needed for memory extraction.

## Implementation

The condensing logic is implemented in the memory-extractor module. It:
1. Parses transcript events
2. Filters out verbose details that aren't needed for memory extraction
3. Summarizes tool results and user interactions
4. Creates a condensed version suitable for Claude API processing

## Effect on Memories

Condensed transcripts still contain enough information to extract valuable memories about:
- What was learned
- Problems solved
- Architectural decisions
- Code changes made
- User preferences

But without the verbose noise that would inflate token costs.
