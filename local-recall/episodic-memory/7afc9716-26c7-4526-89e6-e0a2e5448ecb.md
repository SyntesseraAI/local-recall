The memory extraction system uses transcript condensing via Claude to handle large transcripts. This is implemented in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` and uses prompts from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. The condensing process reduces transcript size before extraction to improve efficiency and token usage.
