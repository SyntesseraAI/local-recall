Memory messages are stored in markdown format with role prefixes to indicate who said what:
- User messages: `**user**:` prefix
- Assistant messages: `**assistant**:` prefix
- Each message is stored as-is from the transcript
- Empty messages are filtered out

This format maintains conversation context while being human-readable in markdown files.
