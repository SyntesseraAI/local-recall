Each memory is stored as a markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing:
- `id`: UUID identifier
- `subject`: One-line brief description
- `keywords`: Array of searchable keywords
- `applies_to`: Scope (global, file:<path>, or area:<name>)
- `occurred_at`: ISO-8601 timestamp for deduplication and sorting
- `content_hash`: SHA-256 prefix (16 chars) for content deduplication

Memory files are version-controlled and located in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`.
