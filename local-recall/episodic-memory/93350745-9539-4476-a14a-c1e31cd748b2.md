Memory extraction logic is separated into a dedicated prompt file (`memory-extraction.ts`) that:

- Defines the system prompt for guiding Claude's memory extraction behavior
- Contains detailed instructions on what constitutes valuable memories
- Specifies the JSON output format expected from the extraction process
- Implements the guidelines for scope (`global`, `file:`, `area:`)
- Separates concerns between extraction logic and API integration

This modular approach allows prompt refinement without modifying the core extractor implementation.
