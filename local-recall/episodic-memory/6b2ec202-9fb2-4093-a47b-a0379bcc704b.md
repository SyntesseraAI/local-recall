# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

A transcript condensing feature has been implemented (commit 8c4fbf5) to improve memory extraction efficiency.

## Purpose

The feature reduces transcript size by removing redundant or less relevant information while preserving the key events and decisions needed for memory extraction.

## Implementation Details

- Condensed transcripts remove verbose tool output while keeping essential context
- This makes memory extraction more efficient and focuses on meaningful events
- Works with the memory extraction pipeline in the MCP server

## Related Components

- `transcript-collector.ts` - Handles transcript collection and processing
- Memory extraction system - Uses condensed transcripts for analysis
