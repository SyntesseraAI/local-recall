# Claude Project Transcripts Location and Format

Claude Code stores project transcripts in the user's local cache on macOS:

## Directory Location
`~/.claude/projects/`

## Folder Naming Convention
Project folders use the absolute path with forward slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## File Format
Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files where each line is a separate JSON object representing a transcript event:
- Each line contains a single JSON object
- Events can have various types and structures
- Files are in `.jsonl` format for efficient line-by-line processing

## Key Considerations
- This path is used by the transcript collector to locate and process transcripts
- The directory structure allows multiple projects to be cached simultaneously
- Transcripts are stored locally on the user's machine
