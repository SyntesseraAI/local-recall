# Incremental JSONL Transcript Files

Claude Code creates JSONL transcript files that grow incrementally as the session progresses:

- A new file is created at the start of each session with a timestamp (e.g., `2025-12-01T10-30-45.jsonl`)
- Each conversation turn (user message or assistant response) is appended as a new line
- Each line is a complete, valid JSON object
- The file remains open and writable during the session
- The file is closed when the session ends

## Implications for Memory Processing

- Cannot rely on file closure to determine if a transcript is complete
- Need content-based detection (e.g., checking for stop hook execution markers) to determine session boundaries
- Files should be processed periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes) and checked for updates
- Content hashing (SHA-256) should be used to detect when files have been modified
- The background daemon approach in the MCP server is the correct pattern for handling this
