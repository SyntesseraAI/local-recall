# Episodic Memory Directory Rename

## Change

The `local-recall/memories/` directory was renamed to `local-recall/episodic-memory/` across the entire project.

## Rationale

This naming better reflects the type of memory being stored - episodic memories are memories of specific events, sessions, and discoveries. This distinguishes them from other potential memory types (e.g., semantic memories, procedural memories) that might be added in the future.

## Files Affected

All references to the memories directory were updated across:
- Core memory management code
- Tests
- Configuration
- Documentation
