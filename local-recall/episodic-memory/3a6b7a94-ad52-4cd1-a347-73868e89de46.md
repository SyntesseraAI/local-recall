The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku (`claude -p --model haiku`) to analyze session transcripts and identify valuable memories. It uses a specialized prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that instructs the model on what constitutes valuable memories (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configurations, user preferences, component relationships, performance considerations). The extraction process filters out generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, sensitive data, and outdated information.
