The memory extraction process uses a structured prompt defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides Claude Haiku on what to extract and what to avoid. The prompt includes specific guidelines about what constitutes valuable memories (architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, quirks) and what should NOT be extracted (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data, obvious information).
