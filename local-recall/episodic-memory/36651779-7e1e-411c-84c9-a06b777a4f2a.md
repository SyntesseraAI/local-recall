The vector store uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. Initial setup is slow (~30-60 seconds on first run) due to downloading the embedding model (~133MB). The model is cached in local_cache/ for subsequent runs. Vector store should be lazily initialized (only when needed for search) rather than on every session start, which is why SessionStart hook does NOT use it.
