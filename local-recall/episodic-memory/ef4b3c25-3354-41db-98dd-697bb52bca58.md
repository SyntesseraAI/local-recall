# Vector Store and Embedding Architecture

Local Recall implements semantic search through a two-component system:

## Components

1. **Embedding Pipeline** (`src/core/embedding.ts`)
   - Converts memory text to semantic embeddings
   - Uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model
   - Caches embeddings for performance

2. **Vector Store** (`src/core/vector-store.ts`)
   - Stores and indexes embeddings
   - Performs similarity searches
   - Returns ranked results based on semantic relevance

## Integration

These components work together to enable semantic search alongside the existing fuzzy keyword matching in `src/core/search.ts`.

## Performance

Vector-based search provides more intelligent matching than simple fuzzy/keyword search, understanding semantic relationships between queries and memories.
