# Transcript Event Structure

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files where each line is a complete, independent JSON object representing a session event.

## Event Object Structure
- Each line is a valid, standalone JSON object
- Events are ordered chronologically
- Common event fields include:
  - `type`: Event type (e.g., "UserPrompt", "AssistantResponse", "ToolInvocation")
  - `timestamp`: ISO-8601 timestamp
  - `content`: Event-specific content

## Implications
- Cannot use streaming JSON parsers that expect a single array
- Must parse line-by-line and handle each line as independent JSON
- No need for special error recovery across lines (each line is atomic)
- File can be processed incrementally from the last known position

## Implementation Considerations
- Use `.split('\n')` to separate lines, then `JSON.parse()` each
- Skip empty lines and lines that fail to parse
- Consider tracking the number of processed lines to avoid reprocessing
