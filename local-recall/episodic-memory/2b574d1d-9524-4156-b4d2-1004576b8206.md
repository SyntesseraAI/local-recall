# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path to the project directory:
- Path segments are separated by `-`
- Forward slashes `/` are converted to `-`
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## Transcript Files

Transcript files are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) format within each project folder:
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`
- Files use `.jsonl` extension
- Multiple transcript files may exist for a single project
- Each line in the JSONL file is a complete JSON object representing a transcript event

## Relevance to Local Recall

The `transcript-collector.ts` in Local Recall needs to:
1. Construct the project folder name from the current working directory
2. Read JSONL files from `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`
3. Parse each line as a separate JSON object to extract transcript events

This is critical for the background daemon that processes transcripts to extract memories.
