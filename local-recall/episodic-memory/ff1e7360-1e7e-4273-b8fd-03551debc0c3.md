Orama is a pure JavaScript vector database with no native dependencies. It can be used for semantic search in multiple concurrent hook processes without mutex issues. Orama stores indexes as JSON files that can be persisted to disk. This is the recommended approach for local-recall's hook architecture where multiple processes need to perform searches simultaneously.
