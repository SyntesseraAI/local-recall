The Local Recall system extracts valuable memories from Claude Code session transcripts. Key things to extract include:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations or optimizations

Memories should be specific with file paths and function names, concise focusing on one concept, and actionable for future assistants.
