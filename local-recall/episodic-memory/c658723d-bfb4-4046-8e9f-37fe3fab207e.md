The memory extractor module uses Claude Haiku (via `claude -p --model haiku`) to process transcripts and extract memories. This is a deliberate choice for efficiency - Haiku is faster and cheaper than larger models for structured extraction tasks. The extractor handles condensed transcripts with tool invocations and results, parsing them to identify what was learned and accomplished.
