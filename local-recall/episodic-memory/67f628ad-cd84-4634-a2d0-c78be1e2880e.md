Session transcripts are structured as formatted events containing `[User]` blocks (user requests), `[Assistant]` blocks (Claude's responses), and `[Tool: Name]` blocks (tool invocations). The memory extraction system parses these formatted events to understand the conversation flow and context for memory creation.
