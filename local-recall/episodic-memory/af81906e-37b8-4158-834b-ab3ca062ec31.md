After fixing the thinking extractor and mutex lock issues, successfully extracted thinking memories from the transcript archive:

- **Transcripts processed**: 59
- **Thinking memories created**: 616 (average ~10.4 per transcript)
- **Format**: Each memory has `## Thought` and `## Output` sections
- **Status**: All memories correctly written to `local-recall/thinking-memory/` directory with unique UUIDs

This demonstrates the thinking memory extraction pipeline is now functioning correctly and can process the full transcript history.
