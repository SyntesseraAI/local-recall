The MCP server exposes memory tools that can create memories directly without relying on hooks. The `episodic_create` (or `memory_create`) tool accepts memory data and creates memories idempotently, meaning duplicate memories are automatically detected and ignored based on occurred_at timestamp and content_hash.

This provides a reliable way to create memories programmatically from any environment that has access to the MCP server, making it suitable for:
- VS Code extensions that don't support the Stop hook
- Custom integrations
- Manual memory creation
- Scripted memory management
