Transcripts for memory extraction use a condensed event format with markers like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]`. The memory extraction system must parse this format to understand the flow of conversation, tool usage, and outcomes. This structured format enables systematic analysis of what was accomplished during a session.
