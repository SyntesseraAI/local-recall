# JSONL Transcript Format

Transcript files use JSONL (JSON Lines) format where each line is a complete, valid JSON object.

## Parsing Approach

To parse JSONL files:
1. Read the file line by line
2. Parse each line as a separate JSON object
3. Skip empty lines
4. Handle potential trailing newlines

## Advantages for Transcripts

- Each line is independent and parseable
- Can stream process large transcript files without loading entire file into memory
- Supports appending new events without rewriting entire file
- Compatible with standard Unix line-processing tools (grep, head, tail)

## Error Handling

When parsing, account for:
- Blank lines (common at end of files)
- Malformed JSON lines (log warning and skip)
- Incomplete writes (partial lines at end of file)

This format is efficient for the transcript-collector module which processes accumulated transcript data.
