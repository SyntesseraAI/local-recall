Raw transcripts can be very long and include many tool invocations, verbose outputs, and debugging steps that aren't useful for memory extraction. Condensing transcripts into key events (what was asked, what was tried, what was learned) makes them manageable and helps extract meaningful insights. The `transcript-collector.ts` module handles this condensing process for the MCP server.
