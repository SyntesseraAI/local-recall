# Memory Extraction Task Analysis

## What to Extract

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Scope Guidelines

- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area

## Memory Characteristics

- **Be specific**: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- **Be concise**: Focus on one concept per memory
- **Be actionable**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work efficiently
