The MemoryExtractor class in src/core/memory-extractor.ts is responsible for processing Claude Code session transcripts and extracting valuable memories. It:

- Uses Claude Haiku to analyze transcripts and extract structured memory data
- Processes transcripts in chunks to handle large inputs
- Calls the memory extraction prompt defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts
- Creates Memory objects with metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash)
- Implements deduplication logic to prevent storing duplicate memories
- Is integrated with the MCP server and Stop hook for automatic memory creation

Key methods:
- `extractMemories(transcript)` - Main entry point for processing transcripts
- Handles both successful extraction and error cases
