# Memory Directory Renaming

The memories directory has been renamed from `memories/` to `episodic-memory/` across the entire project (commit 48ecf07).

## Impact

- All memory file paths now use `local-recall/episodic-memory/` instead of `local-recall/memories/`
- Code references to the memory directory path have been updated throughout
- This change is tracked in git and represents a project-wide refactoring

## Important

When working with memory files or references in code, use the `episodic-memory/` directory name, not `memories/`.
