When extracting memories, follow these principles:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences
- Component relationships
- Performance considerations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data (keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

**Scope guidelines:**
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a file
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component/area

Each memory should be specific with file paths and function names, concise (one concept), and actionable for future assistants.
