The MCP server daemon runs automatic startup sequences with specific timings:

1. **Vector sync**: Begins 2 seconds after server startup, then runs every 10 minutes
2. **Transcript processing**: Begins 5 seconds after server startup, then runs every 5 minutes

These initial delays ensure the server is fully initialized before starting critical background tasks. See lines 169-193 in server.ts for implementation details.
