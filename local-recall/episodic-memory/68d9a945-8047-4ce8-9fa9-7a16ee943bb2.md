Memory creation is idempotent - duplicate memories are detected by findDuplicate() which checks occurred_at timestamp and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix, 16 chars). If a memory with matching timestamp and hash exists, the existing memory is returned instead of creating a new one. This prevents duplicate memories across sessions.
