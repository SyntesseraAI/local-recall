# Claude Transcript Storage

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory where the project path is URL-encoded into the directory name.

## Directory Structure
- Base location: `~/.claude/projects/`
- Directory naming: Project paths are URL-encoded (e.g., `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes a URL-encoded directory name)
- Transcript files: Located within project-specific directories
- Format: JSONL (JSON Lines) format for transcript files

## Key Details
- This is where Claude's MCP server daemon can sync transcripts from when processing memories
- Important for understanding how the memory extraction pipeline accesses transcript data
- The path encoding scheme is critical for the background daemon to locate correct transcripts

## Relevance to Local Recall
The MCP server's background daemon references this location to pull transcripts for memory extraction and processing.
