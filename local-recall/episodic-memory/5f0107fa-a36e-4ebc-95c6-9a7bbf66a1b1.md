The mutex issue with ONNX occurs specifically when multiple processes try to *load/initialize* the model concurrently. Once a single process loads the model, other processes can reuse it without mutex issues. This is why a shared daemon (like Ollama) solves the problem - the model loads once in the daemon, and multiple clients connect via HTTP without triggering concurrent initialization.
