Local Recall is a local markdown-powered memory system that allows Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions. The system stores memories locally within the repository in structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Core components include:

- **Memory Manager** (src/core/memory.ts): Handles CRD operations for memory files
- **Vector Store** (src/core/vector-store.ts): SQLite-backed semantic search using embeddings
- **Embedding Service** (src/core/embedding.ts): Uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model
- **Claude Code Hooks**: SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks for context injection
- **MCP Server** (src/mcp-server/): Exposes memory tools to MCP-compatible clients

Memory files use a standard format with metadata fields: id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash
