# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes converted to dots. For example:
- `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users.joe.Code.Syntessera.local-recall`

## File Structure

Each project folder contains:
- `transcripts/` - Directory containing JSONL files
- Each JSONL file has a name based on session timestamp

## Access Pattern

The MCP server can sync transcripts from these locations to process them for memory extraction. This is how the background daemon discovers new transcripts to analyze.
