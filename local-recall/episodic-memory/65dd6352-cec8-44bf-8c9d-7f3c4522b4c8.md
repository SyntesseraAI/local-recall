The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) to analyze transcripts and extract memories. This choice is intentional for cost efficiency since Haiku is significantly cheaper than larger models while still being capable enough for the memory extraction task.
