# Memory Extraction Using Claude Haiku

The Local Recall system uses `claude -p --model haiku` to extract keywords from user prompts and transcripts during memory creation.

## Process
1. UserPromptSubmit hook: Extracts keywords from user's prompt using Claude Haiku
2. Stop hook (MCP daemon): Processes full transcripts to extract relevant memories
3. Keywords are used for fuzzy matching against existing memory index

## Why Haiku?
- Fast and lightweight for keyword extraction
- Cost-effective for high-frequency operations
- Sufficient for summarization and keyword identification tasks
