The extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` provides detailed guidelines for what constitutes valuable memories:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Component relationships and dependencies
- Performance considerations and optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data (keys, passwords, personal info)
- Quickly outdated information

Memories should be specific (include file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes).
