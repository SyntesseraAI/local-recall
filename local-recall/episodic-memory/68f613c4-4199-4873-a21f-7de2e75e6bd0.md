The memory extraction process uses Claude's API (via `claude` CLI) to intelligently parse transcripts and extract meaningful memories. The extraction uses a structured prompt that guides Claude to identify valuable insights, learned information, and decisions made during the session. This is superior to simple regex/keyword matching as it understands semantic meaning and context.
