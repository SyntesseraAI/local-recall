## Purpose
The logger utility (src/utils/logger.ts) provides structured logging that writes to `local-recall/recall.log` for debugging.

## Key Features
- Supports log levels: debug, info, warn, error
- Can be controlled via `LOCAL_RECALL_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
- Outputs both to console (stderr) and to recall.log file
- Used throughout hooks and daemon for troubleshooting

## Usage in Debugging
When hooks fail, check `local-recall/recall.log` to see detailed execution traces, timing information, and error messages. This file is gitignored and auto-generated.
