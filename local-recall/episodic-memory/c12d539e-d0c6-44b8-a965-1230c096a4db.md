Memory extraction uses structured prompt templates to guide Claude Haiku in extracting keywords and metadata from transcripts. The prompts are designed to:

1. Provide clear instructions for what constitutes valuable memories
2. Specify the exact format Claude Haiku should return (likely JSON)
3. Include examples of good vs. poor keywords
4. Guide the model to extract from the transcript content

The prompt templates are crucial for ensuring consistent, high-quality memory extraction across sessions.
