The vector store implementation uses better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search. Search results use cosine distance with scores ranging from 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (identical). Scores are rounded to 2 decimal places. Results are sorted by score descending, with a recency tie-breaker: when scores are equal, more recent memories (by occurred_at timestamp) are ranked first.
