# Session Transcript Already Available

When analyzing a Claude Code session transcript for memory extraction, the session transcript is already provided as input to the memory extraction process.

The `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` message indicates that you are in the memory extraction phase, analyzing a condensed transcript of the user's session to identify valuable memories to persist.

Key insight: The transcript being analyzed is from the CURRENT session - not a previously processed one. This means memories should be extracted from what just happened in this session, not from external sources.
