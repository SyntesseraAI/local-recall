The memory extraction prompt in `memory-extraction.ts` provides comprehensive guidelines for AI assistants extracting memories:

**Key principles:**
- Extract specific, actionable memories (not generic knowledge)
- Include file paths, function names, and concrete details
- Focus on what was learned, problems solved, and codebase-specific patterns
- Use appropriate scope: `global` (entire codebase), `file:<path>` (specific file), or `area:<name>` (component)

**What to extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions
- Configuration quirks
- User preferences
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**What NOT to extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Trivial or obvious information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

This prompt has proven effective at guiding Claude models to extract meaningful memories that improve future assistant performance on the codebase.
