The MemoryExtractor class in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` processes session transcripts and extracts memories. Key features:
- Uses content_hash (SHA-256 prefix) for deduplication
- Tracks occurred_at timestamp for sorting and change detection
- Searches for existing duplicates before creating new memories
- Integrates with the memory manager to persist extracted memories
- Uses Claude Haiku for intelligent extraction with system prompt guidance
