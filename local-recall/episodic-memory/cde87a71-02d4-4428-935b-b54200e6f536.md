Memory extraction prompts are stored in a centralized file (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) rather than inline in the memory-extractor code. This separation allows:

- Easy maintenance and updates to prompt templates
- Consistency across multiple extraction calls
- Version control and testing of prompts separately
- The ability to experiment with different prompt variations

This is a good architectural pattern for prompt-based systems - keeping prompts in dedicated files makes them more discoverable and maintainable.
