The memory extraction prompt expects Claude to analyze session transcripts and return a JSON object with a 'memories' array. Each memory should include subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and markdown-formatted content. The prompt distinguishes between what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configurations) vs what to ignore (generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, sensitive data).
