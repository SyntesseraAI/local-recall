# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The memory extraction pipeline condenses full transcripts into event-based format before analysis:
- `[User]` - User requests and questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool execution outcomes

This condensed format is more efficient for analysis and helps identify valuable patterns without processing raw transcript data.
