The memory extraction prompt provides explicit guidelines distinguishing between what SHOULD be extracted (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, performance optimizations) and what SHOULD NOT be extracted (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, trivial info, sensitive data, dated information). The prompt also defines the memory format with fields for subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content in markdown.
