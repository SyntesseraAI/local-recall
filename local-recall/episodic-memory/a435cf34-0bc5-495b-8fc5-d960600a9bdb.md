# Transcript Processing Challenges

Transcript files can be very large, making direct processing of the entire transcript impractical for memory extraction.

## Known Issues

- Transcripts grow continuously during a session
- Reading and parsing entire transcripts repeatedly is inefficient
- Sending large transcript content to LLMs for memory extraction is costly

## Solution Strategy

- Implement transcript condensing: summarize events, maintain key information
- Extract only new/changed events since last processing
- Use content hashing to track which transcripts have been processed
- Process incrementally to avoid re-processing the same content
- Consider event filtering to extract only relevant events for memory extraction
