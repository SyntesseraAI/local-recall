The memory-extraction.ts file contains prompts that define how Claude should analyze transcripts and extract memories. These prompts guide the extraction process to ensure memories are specific, concise, actionable, and appropriately scoped. The prompts include guidelines on what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, configuration quirks) and what NOT to extract (generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, sensitive data).
