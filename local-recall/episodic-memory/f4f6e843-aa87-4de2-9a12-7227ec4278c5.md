# Active Refactoring Branch

The project is on branch `claude/refactor-memory-collection-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`, which indicates:
- Memory collection logic is being refactored
- New files have been added: `src/core/embedding.ts`, `src/core/vector-store.ts`
- Core index module (`src/core/index.ts`) was deleted and reorganized
- Multiple core files have been modified
- A new `local-recall/` directory was added (in addition to being the plugin root)

These changes suggest implementation of vector embedding and semantic search capabilities, likely for improved memory retrieval beyond fuzzy keyword matching.
