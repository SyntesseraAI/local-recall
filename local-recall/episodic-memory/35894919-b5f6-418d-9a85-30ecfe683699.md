The memory extraction prompt in memory-extraction.ts instructs Claude Haiku to analyze transcripts and extract memories that capture: architectural decisions and reasoning, bug fixes with root cause analysis, code patterns and conventions, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, and performance considerations. The prompt specifically excludes generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and sensitive data.
