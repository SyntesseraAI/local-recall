# Memory Extraction Process

## Transcript Processing Flow

1. The memory extraction process receives a condensed transcript as input
2. System instructs Claude to extract keywords from the transcript text
3. Keywords are returned as a JSON array (lowercase, specific)
4. These keywords are then used to identify and create relevant memories

## Key Pattern

The process uses Claude (Haiku model) to intelligently identify keywords from raw transcript content before memory creation. This suggests the system may:
- Use keyword extraction to determine relevance
- Avoid creating duplicate memories
- Improve searchability through keyword-based memory discovery

## Implementation Detail

The format is strict: "Return ONLY the JSON object now" - indicating the system expects clean JSON output without explanation or markdown formatting.
