Transcripts processed by Local Recall include detailed information about tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, etc.), including what tools were called and their results. This metadata provides valuable context for memory extraction and helps understand what operations were performed during a session, enabling more precise memory creation about code changes and discoveries.
