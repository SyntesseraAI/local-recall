# User Editing Preference

The user prefers inline editing (Edit tool with old_string/new_string) over complete file replacements (Write tool) for TypeScript and JSON files. This preference applies when making modifications to existing code.

## Reasoning

Inline editing:
- Preserves existing formatting and structure
- Makes changes explicit and reviewable
- Easier to track what specifically changed
- Better for version control and diffs

## When to Apply

Use Edit tool for:
- Modifying existing TypeScript source files
- Updating JSON configuration files
- Changing existing test files

Use Write tool only for:
- Creating brand new files
- When instructed explicitly by the user
