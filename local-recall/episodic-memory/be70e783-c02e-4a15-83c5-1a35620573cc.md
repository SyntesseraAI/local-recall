Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. All memories are stored locally within the repository and are version-controllable. The system uses a SQLite database with vector embeddings for semantic search, and memories are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter containing metadata like id, subject, keywords, applies_to scope, occurred_at timestamp, and content_hash.
