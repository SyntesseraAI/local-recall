# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute project directory by:
1. Converting the path to a base64-encoded string
2. Removing trailing `=` padding
3. Replacing `/` with `_` in the base64 output

Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` converts to a specific encoded folder name.

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) files within the project folder, with one JSON object per line representing each event in the session.

This encoding ensures file system compatibility and handles projects with special characters in their paths.
