The local-recall system ensures memory idempotency through content deduplication. Each memory includes an `occurred_at` ISO-8601 timestamp for when the original event occurred and a `content_hash` SHA-256 prefix (16 chars) for content matching. The `findDuplicate(occurredAt, contentHash)` function in the Memory Manager checks for existing duplicates before creating new memories, preventing duplicate entries when the same memory is created multiple times.
