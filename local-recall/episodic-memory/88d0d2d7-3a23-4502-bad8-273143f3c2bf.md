The system prevents duplicate memories by tracking when events occurred (occurred_at) and computing a SHA-256 hash of the memory content (content_hash). The `findDuplicate` method in memory.ts checks if a memory with the same occurred_at timestamp and content_hash already exists. This allows memories from the same event to be recognized as duplicates even if they're created at different times.
