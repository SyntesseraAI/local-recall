The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku model (via `claude -p --model haiku`) for efficient processing of transcripts. The system extracts keywords and creates memories from transcript content. This is handled by the memory-extractor.ts module which processes transcripts and generates structured memory objects with metadata like id, subject, keywords, applies_to scope, occurred_at timestamp, and content_hash for deduplication.
