# Transcript Format Evolution

The transcript JSONL format appears to have evolved:
- Current format: Each line is a complete message object with role and content
- Content structure: Varies between simple strings and arrays of content blocks/tool uses

When implementing transcript parsing, ensure handling of both message string formats and array-based content structures to support different transcript versions that may exist in user's ~/.claude/projects directories.
