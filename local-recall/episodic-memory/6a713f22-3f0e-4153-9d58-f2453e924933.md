Both `src/core/memory.ts` and `src/core/index.ts` had identical implementations for creating and maintaining `.gitignore` files. This was refactored into a shared utility function `ensureGitignore(baseDir)` in `src/utils/gitignore.ts`. Both files now import and call this shared function instead of duplicating the logic.
