This session involves analyzing Claude Code session transcripts to extract valuable memories that help future AI assistants. The transcript format uses condensed events: `[User]` for user requests, `[Assistant]` for Claude responses, `[Tool: Name]` for tool invocations, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]` for outcomes.

Memories should be specific to the codebase with file paths and concrete details, concise and actionable. Scope should be appropriate: `global` for architecture/conventions, `file:<path>` for file-specific info, and `area:<name>` for components.

Extract architectural decisions, bug fixes with root cause analysis, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, and performance optimizations. Avoid generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, trivial info, and sensitive data.
