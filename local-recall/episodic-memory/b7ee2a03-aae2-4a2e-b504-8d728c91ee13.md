Each extracted memory must have an appropriate scope: `global` for codebase-wide knowledge (architecture, conventions), `file:<path>` for file-specific details, or `area:<name>` for component/feature areas. Proper scope classification helps future assistants quickly find relevant memories without over-generalizing.
