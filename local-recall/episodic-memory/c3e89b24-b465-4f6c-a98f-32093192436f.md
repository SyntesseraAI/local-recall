# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes converted to underscores. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in `transcripts/` subdirectory:
- File naming: `transcript-<timestamp>.jsonl`
- Format: JSON Lines (one JSON object per line)
- Each line contains a single transcript event

## Usage in Local Recall

The `transcript-collector.ts` module uses this path structure to:
1. Locate transcript files for a given working directory
2. Read and parse JSONL transcript data
3. Extract memories from transcript content
4. Track processed transcripts by content hash for deduplication

This is critical for the MCP server daemon which processes transcripts every 5 minutes to extract and create memories.
