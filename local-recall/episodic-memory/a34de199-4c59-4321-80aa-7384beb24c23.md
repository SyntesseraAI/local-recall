The memory extraction system uses carefully structured prompts that guide Claude to output memories in a specific format with YAML frontmatter. The prompts define the extraction task clearly, specify the output format expected (markdown with YAML frontmatter), and provide guidelines for what should and shouldn't be extracted. This ensures consistent, actionable memories across sessions.
