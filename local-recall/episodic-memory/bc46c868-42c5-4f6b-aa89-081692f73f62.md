The memory extractor includes transcript condensing functionality that:
- Reduces large transcripts to key events before passing to Claude
- Preserves important information while removing redundancy
- Decreases token usage and speeds up extraction
- Implemented as a preprocessing step before Claude extraction

This is particularly important for:
- Long coding sessions with extensive back-and-forth
- Reducing API costs when processing accumulated transcripts
- Improving extraction speed in the async daemon
- Maintaining context quality while minimizing input size
