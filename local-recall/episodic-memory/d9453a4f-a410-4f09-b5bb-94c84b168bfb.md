The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. It sends transcript content to Claude with a detailed prompt template defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. The extraction process:

1. Takes a transcript as input
2. Sends it to Claude with extraction prompts
3. Parses Claude's response to extract structured memory data
4. Deduplicates memories using `occurredAt` and `contentHash`
5. Returns an array of extracted memories with metadata

The system relies on Claude's ability to understand context and identify what information would be valuable for future sessions.
