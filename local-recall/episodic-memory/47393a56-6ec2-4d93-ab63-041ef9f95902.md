Claude Code transcripts are stored in `.jsonl` format with one JSON object per line.

## Event Types

Each event has a `type` field that indicates what happened:
- `user_message` - User input
- `assistant_message` - Claude's response
- `tool_invocation` - Tool call (Read, Write, Bash, etc.)
- `tool_result` - Result of tool execution

## Message Structure

Each event contains:
- `timestamp` - When the event occurred
- `type` - The event type
- `content` - The actual message/invocation/result data
- `tool_name` (for tool invocations) - Which tool was called
- Additional metadata as needed

## Parsing Considerations

1. Must be parsed line-by-line (not as a single JSON array)
2. Each line is a complete, valid JSON object
3. Order of events matters for understanding the conversation flow
4. Tool results may span multiple lines if the output is large

## Relevance

Critical for memory extraction from transcripts in the background daemon.
