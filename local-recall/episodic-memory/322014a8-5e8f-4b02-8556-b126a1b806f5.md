The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude's API to intelligently parse session transcripts and extract valuable memories. It leverages a carefully crafted prompt template from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides Claude to identify and structure memories with proper metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash). This approach allows for semantic understanding of what's worth remembering rather than simple keyword matching.
