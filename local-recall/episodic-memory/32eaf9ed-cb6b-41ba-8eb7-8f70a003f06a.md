Search results use cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0 range, rounded to 2 decimals). Results are sorted by score descending. When scores are equal (tie), more recent memories (higher `occurred_at` timestamp) are ranked first. This ensures both relevance and freshness in memory retrieval.
