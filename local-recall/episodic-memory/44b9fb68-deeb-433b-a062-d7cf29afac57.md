The Local Recall memory system has the following components completed:
- Core memory CRUD operations (memory.ts)
- Index management for semantic search
- Fuzzy search implementation using Fuse.js
- MCP Server with 6 exposed tools
- Session-start hook for loading relevant memories
- Stop hook for automatic memory extraction from transcripts
- Keyword extraction utilities

These are the foundational components. Future work can focus on CLI tools, memory deduplication, or live testing.
