The transcript condenser (`src/core/transcript-condenser.ts`) is responsible for parsing raw Claude Code transcripts and extracting key events into a condensed format. It converts verbose tool output into structured event objects with type, timestamp, and content fields. This condensed format is then used by the memory extractor to identify and create memories. The condenser handles various tool types including Read, Edit, Write, Bash, and others, normalizing their output format.
