# Memory Extraction Process

The system uses Claude Haiku model (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) to analyze transcript content and extract keywords.

## How It Works

- Transcript content is sent to Claude Haiku via the Claude API
- The model extracts relevant keywords from the transcript
- Keywords are used to index memories for later searching
- This approach ensures keywords are semantically meaningful and relevant

## Benefits

- Automatic, intelligent keyword extraction
- Captures semantic meaning rather than just frequency-based terms
- Reduces need for manual tagging
- Adaptable to different domains and contexts
