The SessionStart hook is triggered when a Claude Code session begins:
1. Receives JSON input: session_id, transcript_path, cwd
2. Loads all memories from disk via MemoryManager.listMemories()
3. Returns the 5 most recent memories sorted by occurred_at
4. Outputs memory content to stdout (injected into Claude's context)

This is a full reload (not incremental) that intentionally avoids using the vector store to prevent slow initialization on every session start.
