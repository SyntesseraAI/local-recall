# Claude Project Transcripts Location and Path Encoding

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Encoding Convention

Project folder names encode the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: Working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes folder name `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Each folder contains `transcripts.jsonl` file with session transcripts

## Transcript Collection

The `transcript-collector.ts` module reads from these locations to process transcripts and extract memories. This is critical for the background daemon that runs every 5 minutes to process transcripts asynchronously.

## Implementation Detail

When implementing transcript collection, ensure proper path encoding/decoding to match Claude's naming convention for project directories.
