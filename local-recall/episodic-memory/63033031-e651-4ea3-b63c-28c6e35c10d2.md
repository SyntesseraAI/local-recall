The transcript collector had debug-level logging that wasn't visible by default. When running in a new repo, users couldn't see if transcript search was working or not. Solution: Added INFO-level logging at key points:

1. When starting the search (displaying the project path and expected Claude projects directory)
2. When checking if the Claude projects directory exists
3. For each transcript search method (primary, fallback, last resort approaches)
4. Summary of how many transcripts were found and synced

This makes the transcript collection process visible in `local-recall/recall.log` without requiring debug mode.
