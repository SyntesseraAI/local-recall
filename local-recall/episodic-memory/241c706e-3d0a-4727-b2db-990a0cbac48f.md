# Memory Extraction Best Practices

## What to Extract

Extract memories that represent:
- **Architectural decisions and their reasoning** - Why design choices were made
- **Bug fixes and root cause analysis** - How issues were solved and why they occurred
- **Code patterns and conventions** - Project-specific ways of doing things
- **Configuration quirks and gotchas** - Tricky or non-obvious behaviors
- **User preferences discovered** - How the user works and what they prefer
- **Important component relationships** - How different parts interact
- **Performance considerations** - Optimizations and their impact

## What NOT to Extract

Do not extract:
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps that aren't useful long-term
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Memory Scope Guidelines

Choose appropriate scope:
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area
