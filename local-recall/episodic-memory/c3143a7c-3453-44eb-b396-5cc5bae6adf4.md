Transcripts are condensed before being passed to the memory extraction system. This is likely implemented in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` based on recent refactoring commits. The condensing process reduces transcript size while preserving key information needed for memory extraction, improving efficiency and reducing API costs when invoking Claude Haiku.
