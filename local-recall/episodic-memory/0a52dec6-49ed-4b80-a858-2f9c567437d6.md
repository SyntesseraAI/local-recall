# Embedding and Vector Store Implementation

## Files Created

- `src/core/embedding.ts` - BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model via fastembed
- `src/core/vector-store.ts` - Vector store for semantic search

## Model Information

- Using BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) via fastembed library
- Model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use
- First run takes 30-60 seconds for model download
- Subsequent runs load from cache

## Implementation Details

- Embedding dimension: 384 (standard for BGE-small models)
- Lazy initialization: Model loads on first embedding request
- Vector store stores embeddings alongside memory metadata
- Used for semantic search in addition to keyword-based search

## Integration Point

The vector store should be integrated into `src/core/search.ts` to provide semantic search capabilities alongside existing fuzzy keyword matching.
