Local Recall uses SHA-256 content hashing (16-character prefix) combined with occurred_at timestamps to detect and prevent duplicate memories. The `findDuplicate()` method in memory.ts checks both the content hash and occurred_at timestamp to determine if a memory already exists, preventing the system from creating redundant entries.
