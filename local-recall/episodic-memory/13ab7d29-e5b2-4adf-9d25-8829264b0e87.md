# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path, with slashes replaced by dashes. This creates a unique folder for each project location.

Example: Working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` corresponds to folder `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`.

## Accessing Transcripts

Project transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files within these project folders, and can be accessed programmatically for memory extraction and analysis.

## Relevance

This is important for:
- Implementing transcript collection and processing
- Building the MCP server background daemon that syncs transcripts
- Understanding how Claude Code manages persistent session data
