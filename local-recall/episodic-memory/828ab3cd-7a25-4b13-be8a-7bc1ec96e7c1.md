Added `addWithEmbedding()` method to VectorStore to accept pre-computed embeddings instead of computing them via Ollama. Added `syncWithJsonlStore()` method that syncs memories/embeddings between JSONL store and Orama index. Automatically detects new memories (add entries), deletes (delete entries), and new embeddings (embedding entries). Computes missing embeddings on-demand via Ollama. This allows JSONL to be the source of truth while Orama remains the search index.
