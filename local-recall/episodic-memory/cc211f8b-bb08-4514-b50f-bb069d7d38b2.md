# Session Transcript Structure

Claude's cached transcripts follow a JSONL format where each line is a JSON event object.

## Event Structure

Each event in the transcript contains:
- `timestamp`: ISO-8601 timestamp of when the event occurred
- `type`: Event type (e.g., 'user_message', 'assistant_message', 'tool_call', etc.)
- `content`: The actual content/data for that event
- Additional metadata fields depending on the event type

## Parsing Approach

When reading transcripts:
1. Read the file as text
2. Split by newlines to get individual JSON lines
3. Parse each line as JSON
4. Process events in order (they're chronologically ordered)

This understanding is crucial for the transcript-collector to properly parse and extract memories from cached transcripts.
