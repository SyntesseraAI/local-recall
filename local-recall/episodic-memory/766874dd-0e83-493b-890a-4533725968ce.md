# Transcript Condensing

Transcript condensing is a critical optimization step that reduces token usage when extracting memories.

## Purpose

Raw Claude transcripts can be very long (containing full tool outputs, code blocks, etc.). The transcript-condenser component summarizes the transcript to include only the essential information needed for memory extraction:
- User requests and questions
- Assistant explanations and decisions
- Tool invocations and key results
- Important context and findings

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Token Cost**: Condensed transcripts are significantly smaller, reducing the token cost of memory extraction analysis
2. **Faster Processing**: Smaller input means faster analysis by Claude
3. **Better Quality Extraction**: By focusing on key information, the extraction process produces more relevant memories

## Implementation

The transcript-condenser (`src/core/transcript-condenser.ts`) processes raw JSONL transcripts and outputs condensed versions that capture the essential narrative without verbose tool outputs.
