Before sending transcript data to Claude Haiku for memory extraction, the transcript content is condensed to:

1. Reduce token usage and API costs
2. Focus on meaningful interactions and discoveries
3. Remove noise from repetitive or debugging steps
4. Preserve important decisions, problems solved, and learnings

This condensing step is essential for efficient memory extraction at scale, as raw transcripts can be very large.
