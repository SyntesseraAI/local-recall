# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path. The path is converted to a normalized string and hashed.

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files where each line is a complete JSON object representing a message in the conversation.

## Usage in Local Recall

The MCP server background daemon syncs transcripts from this location to process them for memory extraction.
