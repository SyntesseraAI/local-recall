The extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` receives memories in MCP (Memory Creation Protocol) format from Claude, deserializes the JSON responses, and then creates each memory using the `createMemory()` function from the memory manager. This maintains consistency with the rest of the codebase while allowing Claude to generate memories in a standardized format.
