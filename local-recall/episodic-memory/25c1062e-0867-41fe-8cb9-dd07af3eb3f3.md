Local Recall has specific development standards that MUST be followed:

**Testing Requirements:**
- All new features must have corresponding unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests go in `tests/integration/`
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases
- Run with `npm test`, `npm run test:unit`, or `npm run test:integration`

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Documentation must be placed in `docs/` folder
- Update existing docs when modifying functionality
- Keep CLAUDE.md updated with architecture changes

**Build:**
- Use `npm run build` to compile TypeScript
- Use `npm run dev` for watch mode
- Output goes to `dist/` (which is gitignored)
