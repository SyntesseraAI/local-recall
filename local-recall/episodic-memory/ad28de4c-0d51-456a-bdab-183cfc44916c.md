# Session Transcript Condensing

When extracting memories from Claude Code session transcripts, it's important to condense verbose transcripts into a more concise format before analysis.

## Condensing Strategy

1. **Extract key events** from the full transcript
2. **Simplify verbose content** while preserving essential information
3. **Use structured format**:
   - `[User]` - User requests and questions
   - `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
   - `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, etc.)
   - `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool outcome

## Why Condense

- Full transcripts can be extremely long and verbose
- Condensing reduces token usage during memory extraction
- Maintains focus on actionable insights and learnings
- Improves memory quality by removing noise
