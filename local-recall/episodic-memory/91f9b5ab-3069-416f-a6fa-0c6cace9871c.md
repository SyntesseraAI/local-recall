# Code Style and Error Handling Preferences

## Error Handling

- Use try-catch blocks for file system operations
- Employ optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safe property access
- Log errors with context but don't expose implementation details
- Return `null` or specific error objects rather than throwing in utility functions
- Handle file not found errors gracefully (not all operations require file to exist)

## Formatting and Consistency

- Use double quotes for strings (not single quotes)
- Consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Log messages should be concise and descriptive
- Avoid unnecessary comments; code should be self-documenting
- Remove debugging/temporary code after use
- Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
