# TodoWrite Task Tracking Preference

The user (Joe) explicitly wants comprehensive task tracking using the TodoWrite tool:

## Usage Pattern

- Use TodoWrite to plan tasks at the beginning of sessions
- Mark tasks as `in_progress` when starting work on them
- Mark tasks as `completed` immediately after finishing (don't batch completions)
- Create specific, actionable todo items
- Break complex features into smaller manageable steps

## Important Notes

- Only have ONE task in `in_progress` at a time
- Complete current tasks before starting new ones
- This helps provide visibility into progress and prevents forgotten tasks
- It's better to create more granular todos than to batch them together
