Transcripts are condensed into structured events: `[User]` for requests, `[Assistant]` for responses, `[Tool: Name]` for tool invocations, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]` for outcomes. This condensed format is used as input to the memory extraction prompt, allowing Claude to quickly parse session activities and extract valuable memories without processing full verbose transcripts. The format makes it easy to identify what happened, which tools were used, and their outcomes.
