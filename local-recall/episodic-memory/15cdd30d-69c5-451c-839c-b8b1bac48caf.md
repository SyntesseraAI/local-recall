# Code Generation Preferences

The user (Joe) has specific preferences for how code should be generated in this project:

## Avoid Over-Engineering

- Don't add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked
- A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up
- A simple feature doesn't need extra configurability
- Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code not directly changed
- Only add comments where logic isn't self-evident

## Don't Add Unnecessary Features

- Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't happen
- Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations
- Don't design for hypothetical future requirements
- The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task
- Three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction

## Avoid Backwards-Compatibility Hacks

- No renaming unused `_vars`
- No re-exporting types unnecessarily
- No `// removed` comments for removed code
- If something is unused, delete it completely

## Trust Internal Code

- Trust internal code and framework guarantees
- Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
- Don't add extra defensive checks internally
