The prompt system for memory extraction (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) defines clear guidelines for Claude to extract high-quality memories:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Project-specific code patterns and conventions
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Quickly-outdated information

Memories must be:
- Specific (file paths, function names, concrete details)
- Concise (one concept per memory)
- Actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes)
- Appropriately scoped (global, file:path, or area:name)
