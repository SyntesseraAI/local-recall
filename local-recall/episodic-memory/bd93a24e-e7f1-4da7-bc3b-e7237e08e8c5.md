The memory extraction system uses prompt templates defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. These prompts guide Claude in analyzing transcripts and extracting valuable memories with proper formatting, keywords, and scope classification. Keeping prompts separate from the extraction logic allows for easier maintenance and iteration.
