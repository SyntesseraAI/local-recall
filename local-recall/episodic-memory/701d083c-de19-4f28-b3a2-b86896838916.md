The memory extraction process analyzes condensed Claude Code session transcripts to identify valuable knowledge that should be persisted. Transcripts are condensed into events with formats like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]`. The extraction task focuses on architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, user preferences, and component relationships while avoiding generic knowledge and temporary debugging steps.
