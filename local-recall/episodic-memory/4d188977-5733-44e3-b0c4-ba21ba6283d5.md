The memory extractor module uses `claude -p` (Claude preview CLI) to process transcripts and extract memories. This is the mechanism for analyzing session transcripts and identifying valuable information to persist for future sessions. The extractor reads full transcripts and uses prompt-based extraction to identify key learnings, architectural decisions, and problem resolutions.
