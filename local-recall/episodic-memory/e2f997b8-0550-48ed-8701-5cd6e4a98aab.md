Transcripts are condensed into simplified event formats before being passed to the memory extraction prompt. This reduces context size and focuses the AI on extracting relevant information. The condensed format includes: [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], and [Result: OK/ERROR] events, making it efficient for processing while preserving essential information.
