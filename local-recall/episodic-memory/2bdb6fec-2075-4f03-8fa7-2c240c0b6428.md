# Index Caching Pattern in Local Recall

Local Recall uses an intelligent index caching strategy to optimize performance:

## Current Pattern

1. Index is loaded from cache (`local-recall/index.json`) on startup
2. Index is kept in memory for fast searches
3. Index is rebuilt when new memories are created/deleted
4. Full index rebuild is performed when needed

## Performance Consideration

For large memory collections, the full index rebuild can be expensive. The memory extractor needs to be mindful of:
- How frequently the index is rebuilt
- Whether incremental updates could be more efficient
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed memories

## Implementation Details

- Index refresh is handled by `src/core/index.ts`
- Memory operations trigger index updates in `src/core/memory.ts`
- Search queries use the cached index for fast lookups

This pattern balances simplicity with reasonable performance for typical project sizes.
