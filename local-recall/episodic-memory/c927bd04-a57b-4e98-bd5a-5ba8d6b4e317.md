The memory index is stored at local-recall/index.json (gitignored) and maps keywords to memory IDs for fast searching. Index is built via buildIndex() by scanning all memory files in episodic-memory/. The index should be refreshed when new memories are created or deleted. Fuzzy matching is used during searchByKeywords() to handle partial/misspelled queries with configurable threshold (default 0.6).
