When syncing transcripts from Claude's cache, always filter synthetic transcripts BEFORE performing I/O operations (copying). The pattern is to:

1. Check `isSyntheticFile(sourcePath)` before copying
2. Use debug logging when skipping synthetic files
3. Keep cleanup operations as a safety net, not primary filter

This prevents wasted I/O and keeps the codebase efficient.
