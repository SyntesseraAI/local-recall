The transcript processing system condenses full session logs into structured event format with `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]` entries before sending them to Claude for memory extraction. This condensation reduces token usage and focuses the model on the most relevant information.
