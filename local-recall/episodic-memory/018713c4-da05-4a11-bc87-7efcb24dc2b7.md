# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line), not as single JSON objects.

Each line contains:
- `type`: The event type (e.g., "user", "assistant", "tool")
- `timestamp`: When the event occurred
- Additional fields depending on the event type

## Implications for Transcript Processing

When reading transcript files:
1. Open the file and read it line by line
2. Parse each line as a separate JSON object
3. Do NOT attempt to parse the entire file as a single JSON object
4. This prevents issues with large transcripts that span many events
