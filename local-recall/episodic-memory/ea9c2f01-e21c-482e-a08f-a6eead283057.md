Thinking memories are a specialized memory type that stores Claude's internal reasoning alongside its outputs:

1. **Format**: Each thinking memory has `## Thought` and `## Output` sections in markdown
2. **Extraction**: The MCP daemon extracts thinking blocks from transcripts (20 parallel extraction) and pairs them with corresponding text outputs
3. **Filtering**: Tool-only responses are skipped (only text outputs paired with thinking)
4. **Retrieval**: On each prompt, thinking memories are searched semantically and injected with minimum similarity threshold (default 0.5, configurable to 0.8)
5. **Purpose**: Provides concrete examples of "how I reasoned → what I produced" for similar future tasks
6. **Configuration**: Independent settings - thinkingMaxTokens (default 1000), thinkingMinSimilarity (default 0.5)
7. **Reset**: To rebuild thinking memories from scratch, delete thinking-processed-log.jsonl, orama-thinking-index.json, and thinking-memory/ directory

Thinking memories enable more contextual and reasoned responses by showing the thought process behind previous solutions.
