Transcripts are condensed into standardized events:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This format enables consistent parsing and analysis of session activities for memory extraction.
