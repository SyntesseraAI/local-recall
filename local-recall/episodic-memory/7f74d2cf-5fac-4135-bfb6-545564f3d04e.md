# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Becomes folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## Transcript File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory:
- Pattern: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`
- File format: `.jsonl` (JSON Lines - one JSON object per line)
- Each line contains a transcript event with structure like: `{"type":"...","content":"...","timestamp":...}`

This path encoding is important for the MCP server's transcript collector to locate and process transcript files correctly.
