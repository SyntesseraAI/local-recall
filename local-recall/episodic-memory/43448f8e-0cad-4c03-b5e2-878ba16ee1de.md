The Stop hook is currently disabled because memory extraction moved to the MCP server daemon. The daemon processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes (configurable via `indexRefreshInterval`). This approach avoids blocking the Claude Code UI and allows processing of long transcripts. The daemon uses `claude -p` to extract memories from transcripts and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection.
