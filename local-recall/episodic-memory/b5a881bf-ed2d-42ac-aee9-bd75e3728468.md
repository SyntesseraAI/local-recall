# Transcript Condensing Format

Transcripts are condensed into a human-readable event format for memory extraction.

## Event Types

- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses or explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool execution with brief result summary

## Purpose

This condensed format makes it easier to:
1. Extract meaningful memories from transcripts
2. Understand what happened during a session at a glance
3. Feed into Claude's memory extraction process
4. Reduce token usage when analyzing transcripts

## Implementation

The `condenseTranscript()` function in `transcript-collector.ts` converts raw JSONL transcript events into this condensed string format.
