# Memory Keyword Selection

When creating memories from extracted content, keyword selection significantly impacts searchability and usefulness.

## Key Principles

1. **Specificity over generality**: Use specific terms that will actually be searched for
   - Bad: `["code", "function", "work"]`
   - Good: `["transcript-collector", "condensing", "memory-extraction"]`

2. **Include terminology that will be used in future searches**: Think about what future AI assistants might search for when working on related tasks

3. **Mix concrete and abstract keywords**:
   - Concrete: Specific file names, function names, library names
   - Abstract: General concepts being discussed

4. **Avoid generic keywords**: Keywords like "code", "function", "task" don't help narrow searches

5. **Limit to 1-10 keywords**: Too many keywords dilute the signal

## Examples

For a memory about transcript processing:
- ✓ Good: `["transcript", "jsonl", "claude-projects", "macos", "parsing"]`
- ✗ Bad: `["code", "file", "process", "work", "implement"]`
