# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path of the project:
- Forward slashes `/` are replaced with underscores `_`
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`

## Transcript Organization

Within each project folder:
- `transcripts/` directory contains transcript files
- Each transcript is a separate `.json` file
- Transcripts follow Claude's internal format for sessions

This path-based naming convention is important for the transcript-collector to correctly map between projects and their transcript directories.
