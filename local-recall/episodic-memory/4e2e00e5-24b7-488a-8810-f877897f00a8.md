The system prompt and instructions for memory extraction are stored in a dedicated file `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` rather than being embedded in the extractor logic. This follows a separation of concerns pattern and makes it easier to maintain and update extraction logic independently from the core extractor implementation.
