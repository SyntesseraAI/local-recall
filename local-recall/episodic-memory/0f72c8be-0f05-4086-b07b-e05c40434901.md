# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by hyphens and trimmed to 40 characters.

### Examples

- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
  - Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-lo` (40 char prefix)

- Working directory: `/path/to/project`
  - Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/path-to-project` (full path with hyphens)

## Implementation Details

The `transcript-collector.ts` module handles this path conversion:
- Converts absolute paths to folder names using path-to-string mapping with hyphens
- Truncates long paths to 40 characters to avoid filesystem limitations
- Searches `~/.claude/projects/` for matching transcript folders
- Reads `.jsonl` transcript files from the matched folder

## Relevance

This is critical for the transcript collection feature which:
1. Extracts raw transcripts from Claude's cache
2. Processes them to extract memories
3. Feeds them into the memory extraction pipeline

Understanding this path conversion is essential when:
- Debugging transcript collection issues
- Testing transcript paths programmatically
- Building features that reference transcripts from Claude's system directory
