The memory extraction process analyzes Claude Code session transcripts that are condensed into events:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool calls

Special `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` markers identify transcript sections requiring analysis. This structured format helps identify what was learned, problems solved, and codebase-specific knowledge that should be preserved as memories.
