When initializing the memory system, the `local-recall` directory and its `.gitignore` file must be created BEFORE attempting to build the index. The previous implementation only created these during index building, causing the directory structure to be incomplete in certain initialization paths.

Ensure MemoryManager is instantiated/initialized before IndexManager to guarantee proper directory setup.
