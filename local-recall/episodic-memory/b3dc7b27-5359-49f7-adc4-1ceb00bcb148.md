The Local Recall plugin uses `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable in `hooks.json` to dynamically reference hook scripts relative to where the plugin is installed. This allows the plugin to work correctly whether it's:

1. Installed as an npm package in node_modules
2. Cloned locally in a custom directory
3. Set up in various development environments

Hooks then receive the actual `cwd` (current working directory) via stdin to operate on the user's project, ensuring proper path resolution regardless of installation location.
