Individual memory markdown files stored in local-recall/episodic-memory/ ARE version-controlled and committed to git, allowing memories to be shared across team members. However, the local-recall/memory.sqlite database is gitignored because it's auto-generated from the markdown files and contains vector embeddings. The .gitignore also excludes memory.sqlite and recall.log (debug log). This means memories persist as git history while avoiding database file conflicts.
