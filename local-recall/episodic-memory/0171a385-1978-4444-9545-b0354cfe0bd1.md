The transcript collection process now filters synthetic transcripts BEFORE copying them from Claude's cache, rather than copying and then cleaning up. This optimization prevents unnecessary I/O.

Previous flow:
1. Copy transcript from cache
2. Clean up synthetic files

New flow:
1. Clean up existing synthetic files
2. Check `isSyntheticFile()` on source transcript
3. Skip copying if synthetic (with debug log)
4. Only copy legitimate transcripts

This avoids the overhead of copying files that would immediately be removed by cleanup.
