The Local Recall project is built with TypeScript (5.9+) and uses:

- **better-sqlite3**: SQLite database driver for vector store
- **sqlite-vec**: Extension for vector similarity search
- **fastembed**: Embedding service using BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB)

The embedding model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use and cached for subsequent runs. First startup may take 30-60 seconds while the model downloads. If tokenizer errors occur, delete the corrupted cache directory (`rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*`) and it will re-download automatically.
