# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

When extracting memories from Claude Code transcripts, the raw JSONL format is too verbose and detailed for effective memory extraction.

## Process

1. Load JSONL transcript file (each line is a JSON event)
2. Condense events into a human-readable format:
   - `[User]` - User messages/requests
   - `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses
   - `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations with parameters
   - `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool outcomes
3. Remove repetitive content, timestamps, and implementation details
4. Focus on high-level flow and decisions

## Why Condense?

Raw transcripts contain:
- Detailed timestamps and metadata
- Full file contents (can be thousands of lines)
- Verbose tool parameters
- Repetitive context

Condensed format is more suitable for Claude Haiku to extract meaningful memories about decisions, patterns, and learnings.
