The project uses the `fastembed` library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) for semantic similarity search. The embedding model is cached in `local_cache/` and automatically downloaded on first run (30-60 seconds). Vector embeddings are stored in an SQLite database with the sqlite-vec extension, enabling cosine distance similarity scoring with results ranked 0.0 to 1.0.
