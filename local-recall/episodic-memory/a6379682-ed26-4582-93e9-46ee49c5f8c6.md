Local Recall uses the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to local_cache/ on first startup (takes 30-60 seconds). Subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file not found error occurs, remove local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5* and the model will re-download.
