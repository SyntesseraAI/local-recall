Memory extraction uses a dedicated prompt system stored in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This contains the system prompt and extraction guidelines that guide Claude in identifying valuable memories from transcripts. The prompt system is used by the memory extractor to ensure consistent, high-quality memory extraction across sessions.
