When local_cache files are accidentally committed but not yet pushed, use `git filter-branch --force --index-filter` to remove them from the last N commits. This approach is safe for unpushed commits. The process involves: 1) Add local_cache/ to .gitignore, 2) Use filter-branch to remove from recent commits, 3) Verify the cleanup. This is preferable to force push after the fact.
