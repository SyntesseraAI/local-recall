The vector store is SQLite-backed using better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension. Embeddings are generated using fastembed with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). Search results use cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0 range, rounded to 2 decimal places). Results are sorted by score descending, with recency (occurred_at) as tie-breaker for equal scores.
