Local Recall uses Orama (pure JavaScript vector store) with Ollama for embedding generation. The nomic-embed-text model produces 768-dimensional embeddings. Index files are stored as JSON (orama-episodic-index.json, orama-thinking-index.json) and are gitignored as auto-generated. Cosine distance is used for similarity scoring (0.0-1.0, rounded to 2 decimals). Results are ranked by score descending with recency tie-breaking.
