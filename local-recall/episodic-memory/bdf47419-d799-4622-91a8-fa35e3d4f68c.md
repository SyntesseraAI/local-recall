The memory extractor processes transcripts in a condensed format showing:
- `[User]` - User requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude responses
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Bash, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool outcomes

This format preserves the important facts (what was learned, what was fixed, what was tried) without storing raw full transcript content, making it more efficient for analysis.
