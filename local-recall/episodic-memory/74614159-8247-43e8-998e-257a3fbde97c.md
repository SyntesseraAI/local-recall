# Trivial Task Memory Extraction

The user is not interested in extracting memories from trivial tasks like:
- Simple keyword extraction from text
- JSON formatting of data
- Echo/example responses

These types of interactions don't add value to the memory system and should not be extracted as memories. Focus on extracting memories from tasks that involve:
- Bug fixes or problem solving
- Architectural decisions
- Code patterns or conventions
- Integration between components
- Configuration or setup issues
