The memory extraction process uses Claude's API to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. The implementation in `memory-extractor.ts` uses streaming responses to handle potentially large transcripts efficiently. This approach allows the system to process transcripts asynchronously and convert unstructured transcript data into structured memory objects with proper metadata (subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash).
