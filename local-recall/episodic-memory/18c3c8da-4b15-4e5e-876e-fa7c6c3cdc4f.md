The BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) is automatically downloaded on first use. If tokenizer file not found error occurs:
- Error: 'Tokenizer file not found at local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json'
- Root cause: Corrupted/incomplete cache (usually from interrupted download)
- Fix: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and model will re-download on next run
