The memory extraction system in memory-extractor.ts uses the Claude API (claude-3-5-sonnet model) to analyze session transcripts. It sends a structured prompt from memory-extraction.ts that instructs Claude to extract valuable memories from transcripts. The system parses Claude's JSON response to create memory objects with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content fields. This is part of the MCP server's background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously.
