# Transcript Analysis Pattern

When extracting memories from Claude transcripts, the content follows a structured format:

## Event Format
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses or explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This condensed format makes it easy to understand the flow of a session and identify key learnings, decisions, and problems solved.

When analyzing transcripts for memory extraction, look for:
1. What was learned
2. What is now known
3. Project-specific patterns discovered
4. Problems solved and solutions applied
