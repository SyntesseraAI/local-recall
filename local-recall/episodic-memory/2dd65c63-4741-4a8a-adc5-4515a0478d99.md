Rather than maintaining shared state across hook processes, store vector indexes as JSON files in the local-recall directory. Each hook process independently loads the index from disk when needed. This eliminates concurrency issues and aligns with the stateless hook architecture. Use Orama's persist() method to save indexes to disk after modifications.
