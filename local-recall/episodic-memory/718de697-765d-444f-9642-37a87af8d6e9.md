Memory files are stored as markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory and ARE version-controlled (committed to git). This allows:
- Sharing memories across team members
- Reviewing memory creation history in git log
- Collaborative improvement of memories

The `local-recall/index.json` (keyword index cache) and `recall.log` are gitignored as they are auto-generated.
