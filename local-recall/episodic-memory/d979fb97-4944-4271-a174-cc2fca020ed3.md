# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes and dots replaced by underscores.

### Example
For a project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`:
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`
- Transcripts location: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files where each line is a separate JSON object representing a message or tool invocation in the session.

## Usage in local-recall

The `TranscriptCollector` class uses this path format to locate and read transcripts for processing and memory extraction. The path conversion algorithm should account for both forward slashes and dots in the original path.
