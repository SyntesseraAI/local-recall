The transcript.ts utility parses Claude Code session transcripts into structured events with types like [User], [Assistant], [Tool], and [Result]. This enables memory extraction from condensed transcripts that show the flow of a coding session. The parser handles tool invocations and their outcomes to help identify what was learned and accomplished.
