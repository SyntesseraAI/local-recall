## Keyword Extraction Strategy

When extracting keywords from user prompts:

- **Use Claude Haiku model**: Much faster and cheaper than Sonnet for simple extraction tasks
- **System prompt approach**: Give Haiku a clear instruction to extract keywords
- **JSON output**: Request structured JSON response for easy parsing
- **Trade-off**: Haiku is sufficient for keyword extraction; doesn't need Sonnet's reasoning power

This is a good example of choosing the right model for the task rather than always using the most powerful model.
