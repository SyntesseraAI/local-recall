# Memory Extraction Guidelines

When extracting memories from session transcripts, follow these principles:

**Extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to this project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations applied

**Do NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

Focus on making memories specific, actionable, and valuable for future AI assistants working on the codebase.
