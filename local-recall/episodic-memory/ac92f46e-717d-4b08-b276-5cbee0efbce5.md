Claude Code fetches plugins from GitHub repositories. The MCP server startup failure was caused by `local-recall-plugin/scripts/` being in .gitignore, so the plugin couldn't execute the startup script. When distributing the local-recall plugin via GitHub, the hook scripts in `local-recall-plugin/scripts/` must be git-tracked (not in .gitignore) for Claude Code to find and execute them. This applies to: `session-start.js`, `stop.js`, and `user-prompt-submit.js`.
