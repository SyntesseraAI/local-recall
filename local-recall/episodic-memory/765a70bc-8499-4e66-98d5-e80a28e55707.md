The memory extraction process works with condensed transcripts that use an event-based format:

- `[User]` - What the user asked or requested
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude said or explained
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This condensed format helps extract memories efficiently by focusing on the key interactions and outcomes rather than full conversation text.
