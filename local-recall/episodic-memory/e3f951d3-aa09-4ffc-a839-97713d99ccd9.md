The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API with streaming to process transcripts and extract valuable memories. The system:

- Uses `anthropic.messages.stream()` for streaming responses
- Employs a custom prompt system defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`
- Processes transcripts by extracting memories based on learned information, architectural decisions, bug fixes, and code patterns
- Returns structured memory objects with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content
- Handles errors gracefully and logs failures appropriately

This streaming approach is memory-efficient for processing large transcripts.
