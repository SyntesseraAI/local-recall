Before extracting memories from a transcript, the transcript is first condensed using the `condenseTranscript()` function. This preprocessing step:
- Reduces the size of the transcript while preserving important information
- Helps reduce token costs when sending transcripts to Claude Haiku for extraction
- Is a critical optimization step in the memory extraction pipeline

The condensing is done via `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` which provides this utility function.
