# Thinking Memory Cleanup Operation

Approximately 80+ thinking memory files were deleted in a batch operation. This includes IDs like:
- 012c7ece-33ff-4266-9cda-93d65ae88e3d.md
- 02f089cd-9b80-43c5-b45a-fcd6559d860c.md
- And many others...

This could indicate either:
1. A reset of the thinking memory system as part of the JSONL migration
2. A cleanup of obsolete or duplicate memories
3. A full reprocessing of transcripts with new extraction logic

The CLAUDE.md mentions that to fully reset thinking memories: `rm local-recall/thinking-processed-log.jsonl && rm local-recall/orama-thinking-index.json && rm -rf local-recall/thinking-memory/`
