The SessionStart hook triggers when a Claude Code session begins. It reads the 5 most recent memories directly from filesystem sorted by `occurred_at` timestamp and outputs their content to stdout. This context is injected into Claude's conversation, providing continuity from previous sessions without requiring database queries.
