Memory extraction prompts are stored in a dedicated `memory-extraction.ts` file rather than inline in the extractor code. This design:

1. Separates prompt logic from implementation logic
2. Makes prompts easier to iterate and improve
3. Allows version control and A/B testing of different extraction strategies
4. Keeps the memory-extractor.ts file focused on orchestration

The prompt file should contain clear instructions for Claude on what constitutes a valuable memory and how to structure the output.
