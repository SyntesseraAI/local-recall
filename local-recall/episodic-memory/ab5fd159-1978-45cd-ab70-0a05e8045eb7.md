# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` maps to `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) where each line is a separate JSON object representing an event in the conversation.

## Accessing Transcripts

The transcript collector needs to:
1. Replace slashes in the working directory path with dashes
2. Look in `~/.claude/projects/<derived-name>/transcripts/`
3. Process `.jsonl` files to extract conversation events

This is important for the MCP server's background daemon which syncs and processes transcripts asynchronously.
