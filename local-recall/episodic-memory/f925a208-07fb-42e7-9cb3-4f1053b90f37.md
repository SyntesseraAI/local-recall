The memory extraction system is processing its own internal `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` prompts as regular user transcripts, creating an infinite loop. The system should filter out or skip any transcript entries that contain LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL prefixes to prevent recursive memory extraction attempts.

This occurs because the transcript processing doesn't distinguish between user session content and internal system memory extraction metadata.
