The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Anthropic Claude API (specifically the `@anthropic-ai/sdk` package) to analyze transcripts and extract memories. It uses streaming mode with `stream: true` to process Claude's responses efficiently. The extraction process receives a transcript and uses a prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide Claude in identifying valuable memories that should be persisted for future sessions.
