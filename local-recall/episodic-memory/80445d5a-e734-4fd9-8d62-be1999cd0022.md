# Git Commit Practices

The user prefers NOT to auto-commit changes. When using git-related tools:

## Rules

1. NEVER create commits without explicit user request
2. Always ask the user if unsure about committing
3. Use `git status` and `git diff` to show changes before committing
4. Only commit when the user specifically asks "create a commit" or similar
5. Follow git safety protocols (no force push, no amending other developers' commits)

## Reasoning

This ensures the user maintains full control over what gets committed to the repository and maintains clean git history.
