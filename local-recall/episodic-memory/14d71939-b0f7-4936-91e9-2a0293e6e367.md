Three hooks integrate Local Recall with Claude Code: SessionStart (loads 5 most recent memories), UserPromptSubmit (semantic search before prompt processing), and Stop (extracts memories from transcripts). Hooks are configured in hooks.json and receive JSON via stdin, outputting memory content to stdout for context injection.
