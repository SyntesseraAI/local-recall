The MemoryExtractor's extractMemories() method creates memories with built-in deduplication. It calls memory.createMemory() which checks for existing duplicates using occurred_at timestamp and content_hash before creating new memory files. This prevents duplicate memories from being created when transcripts are re-processed, making the extraction process idempotent and safe to run multiple times.
