# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Conversion

The project folder name converts the absolute path by replacing slashes with dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the project folder
- This conversion allows Claude to maintain transcripts for multiple projects in a single directory

## Usage

When building transcript collection logic, convert working directory paths by replacing `/` with `-` to locate the correct transcript directory.
