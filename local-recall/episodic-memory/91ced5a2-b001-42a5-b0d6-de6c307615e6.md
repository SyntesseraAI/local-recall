Removed `ts-textrank` dependency and implemented simpler logic: for multiline text, extract the first line; for single-line text, extract up to the first period (.) or return the entire text if no period exists. This applies to both `generateSubject()` in summarize.ts and the local `generateSubject()` in transcript.ts.
