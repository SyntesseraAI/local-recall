The memory extraction system is undergoing a significant refactoring:

**Old approach:**
- Used keyword-based indexing and fuzzy matching
- Simple metadata in YAML frontmatter
- Limited semantic understanding

**New approach:**
- Introducing `src/core/embedding.ts` for semantic embeddings
- Creating `src/core/vector-store.ts` for vector storage and similarity search
- BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model for semantic understanding
- Better memory deduplication and relevance matching

This refactoring improves memory quality and retrieval accuracy significantly.
