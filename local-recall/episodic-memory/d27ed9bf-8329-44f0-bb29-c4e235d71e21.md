The src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts file (478 lines read) contains prompt templates that guide Claude when extracting memories from transcripts. These prompts are critical for:

- Defining what constitutes valuable memory (architecture decisions, bug fixes, patterns, configurations)
- Instructing Claude on memory scope and applicability (global, file-specific, or area-based)
- Ensuring consistent memory extraction across different sessions
- Guiding the format and structure of extracted memories

The prompts distinguish between information to extract and information to skip (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data, outdated information).
