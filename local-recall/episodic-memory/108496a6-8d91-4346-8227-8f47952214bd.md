# Transcript Condensing

The project implements transcript condensing to improve memory extraction efficiency. Rather than processing entire transcripts, the MCP daemon condenses them into a more compact format before extraction.

This condensing:
- Reduces noise and irrelevant information
- Improves keyword extraction quality
- Reduces token usage when processing with Claude Haiku
- Makes memories more focused and actionable
