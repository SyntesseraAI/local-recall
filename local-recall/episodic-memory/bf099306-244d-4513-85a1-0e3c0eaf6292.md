The memory extraction process uses prompt templates defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide Claude's analysis of transcripts. This ensures consistent and structured extraction of memories from Claude Code sessions, converting raw transcript data into actionable memory files that follow the project's memory file format with proper keywords, scope, and content organization.
