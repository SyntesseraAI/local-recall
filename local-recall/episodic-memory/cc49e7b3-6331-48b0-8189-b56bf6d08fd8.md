The memory extraction prompt system defines how transcripts are analyzed to create memories. The prompt instructs Claude to:

1. Analyze session transcripts and extract valuable insights
2. Output memories in YAML frontmatter format (between '---' delimiters)
3. Include metadata fields: id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash
4. Provide detailed memory content in markdown

Key considerations:
- Transcript context is injected into the prompt for analysis
- The system expects specific YAML structure for parsing
- Memory decisions are made by the LLM during analysis
- This prompt guides what memories are considered valuable
