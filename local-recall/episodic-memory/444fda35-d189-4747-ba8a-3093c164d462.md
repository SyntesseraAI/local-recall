# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Slashes `/` are replaced with dashes `-`
- The full path is used as the folder name

**Example:**
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## File Structure

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files within the project folder:
- Each session creates a transcript file with ISO-8601 timestamp in filename
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-mm-ssZ.jsonl`

## Accessing Transcripts

The transcript collector in Local Recall syncs transcripts from this location during MCP server background daemon runs (every 5 minutes).
