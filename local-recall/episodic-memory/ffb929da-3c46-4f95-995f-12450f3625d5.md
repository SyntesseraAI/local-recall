# Memory Extraction Guidelines

## What to Extract
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to this project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

## What NOT to Extract
- Generic programming knowledge (already known)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that would become outdated quickly

## Memory Quality Requirements
- Be specific: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- Be concise: Focus on one concept per memory
- Be actionable: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work efficiently
- Use appropriate scope: `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`
