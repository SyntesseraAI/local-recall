# Transcript Event Format

Transcript files are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) format where each line is a separate JSON object.

## Event Structure

Each event object contains:
- `type`: The type of event (e.g., 'user_message', 'assistant_message', 'tool_call', etc.)
- `role`: Who performed the action ('user', 'assistant')
- `content`: The actual content/data for that event

## Parsing Considerations

When reading JSONL files:
1. Split by newlines
2. Parse each non-empty line as JSON
3. Handle various event types appropriately
4. The transcript collector needs to process these events to extract meaningful memories

## Relevance to Memory Extraction

The transcript-collector.ts needs to:
- Read JSONL format correctly
- Filter events by type and role
- Extract user queries and assistant responses
- Identify tool usage and outcomes
- Condense multi-line transcripts into key learnings
