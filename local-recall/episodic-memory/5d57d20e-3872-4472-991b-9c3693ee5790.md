The memory extraction system processes condensed transcripts where each event is marked with brackets:
- `[User]` for user requests
- `[Assistant]` for Claude responses
- `[Tool: Name]` for tool invocations
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` for tool outcomes

This format allows efficient extraction of structured memories from session history without processing raw transcripts.
