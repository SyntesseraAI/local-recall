The codebase migrated from an HTTP server architecture to using Orama directly for vector search. Orama is a pure JavaScript library with no native dependencies or mutex issues, so hooks can call it directly without needing a separate daemon HTTP server. The old `http-server.ts` mentioned in docs doesn't exist - Orama handles all vector operations in-process within hooks and MCP server.
