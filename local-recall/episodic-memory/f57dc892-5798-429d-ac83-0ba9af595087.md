# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files where:
- Each line is a complete JSON object representing a single event
- Events can represent user messages, assistant responses, tool invocations, etc.
- Files can be parsed line-by-line using standard JSON parsing

## Usage

This information is essential for the `transcript-collector` module which needs to:
1. Locate transcript files for the current project
2. Read and parse JSONL format correctly
3. Extract meaningful information from transcript events
4. Support memory extraction from transcript content
