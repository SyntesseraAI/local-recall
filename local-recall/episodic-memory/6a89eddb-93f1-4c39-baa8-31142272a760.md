The memory extraction process follows a pipeline: (1) Transcript Collector syncs transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/` to a working directory, (2) Memory Extractor processes transcripts using Claude to extract meaningful memories, (3) Memories are created in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`, (4) Index is refreshed. The MCP server runs a background daemon that executes this pipeline every 5 minutes. Transcripts are tracked by content hash for change detection - if a transcript changes, associated memories are deleted and recreated.
