During a recent refactoring branch (`claude/refactor-memory-collection-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`), the file `src/core/index.ts` was deleted. This was part of a larger refactoring of the memory collection and core module structure.

Context:
- The deletion is on the refactoring branch, not yet merged to main
- Part of broader changes to memory extraction and transcript handling
- May indicate a reorganization of how core functionality is exported or structured
- Check git history and recent commits for the full scope of changes
