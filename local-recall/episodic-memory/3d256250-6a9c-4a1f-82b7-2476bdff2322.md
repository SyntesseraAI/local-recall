# Transcript Collector Implementation

The `TranscriptCollector` class is responsible for discovering and processing Claude Code project transcripts from the user's home directory.

## Key Responsibilities

- Discovers transcript files from `~/.claude/projects/` directory
- Tracks processed transcripts using content hashes to detect changes
- Collects transcript data for memory extraction
- Handles JSONL file parsing for transcript events

## Important Details

- Project folder names use dashes instead of forward slashes (path transformation)
- Transcript files are named with session IDs and have `.jsonl` extension
- Uses content hash tracking to determine which transcripts need processing
- Handles the case where transcripts directory may not exist
