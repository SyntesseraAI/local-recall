Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use (30-60 seconds on initial run). If tokenizer errors occur, delete the corrupted cache directory (e.g., `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*`) and the model will re-download automatically on next run.
