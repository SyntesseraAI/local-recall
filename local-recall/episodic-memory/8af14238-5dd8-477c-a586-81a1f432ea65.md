# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files where each line is a separate JSON object:
- Files are named with timestamps: `transcript_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jsonl`
- Each line represents an event in the transcript (user message, assistant response, tool call, result)
- The MCP server processes these transcripts to extract memories

## Key Information

- The transcript collector uses the Claude SDK to get the project path
- This is used by the Stop hook and MCP server background daemon to find transcripts
- Understanding this path structure is essential for debugging transcript-related issues
