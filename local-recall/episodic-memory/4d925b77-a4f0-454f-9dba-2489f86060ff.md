Ollama is an npm-installable embedding server that:
- Runs as a single daemon on port 11434
- Loads the embedding model once into memory
- Serves HTTP requests from multiple clients simultaneously
- Prevents ONNX mutex issues because only one process initializes the model
- Supports multiple Claude instances calling the same HTTP endpoint
- Model: `nomic-embed-text` (768 dimensions, ~274MB)

Installation: `brew install ollama` (macOS), then `ollama pull nomic-embed-text` and `ollama serve`.

This solves the concurrent initialization problem while maintaining support for multiple simultaneous Claude instances.
