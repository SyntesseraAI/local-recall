The memory extraction process uses `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` markers in the system prompt to signal that the transcript being analyzed is for memory extraction purposes. This special marker helps Claude understand the context and task of analyzing a session transcript. The transcript is condensed into structured events with `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]` formats to make analysis more efficient.
