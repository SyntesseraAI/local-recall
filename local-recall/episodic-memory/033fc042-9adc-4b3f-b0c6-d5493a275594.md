Claude stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project folders use a URL-encoded path format (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`) and contain transaction logs with UUIDs as filenames (e.g., `086dd5...`). This is useful for the MCP server background daemon which syncs transcripts for memory extraction.
