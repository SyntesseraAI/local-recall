# User Workflow Preferences

Based on session interactions, the user prefers a detailed exploratory approach for complex tasks:

1. **Initial Analysis Phase**: Thoroughly analyze requirements and understand the problem
2. **Planning Phase**: Develop clear implementation plans before coding
3. **Review Feedback**: Incorporate feedback on the plan before executing
4. **Implementation Phase**: Execute the plan step-by-step

## Applied Pattern

When presented with larger features or architectural questions:
- First ask clarifying questions to understand requirements
- Propose an approach or plan
- Get user feedback/approval
- Then implement

This approach works better than:
- Jumping directly to implementation
- Making assumptions about requirements
- Building without validation
