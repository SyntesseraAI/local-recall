# Memory Extraction Task Pattern

The user is testing or using the memory extraction system to:
1. Extract keywords from provided text
2. Return them as a JSON array
3. No explanation or markdown formatting needed - just raw JSON

This appears to be part of the transcript analysis workflow where:
- The system analyzes Claude Code transcripts
- Extracts valuable memories based on what was learned
- Uses structured JSON format for storage and processing
- Applies appropriate scope (global, file-specific, or area-specific)
