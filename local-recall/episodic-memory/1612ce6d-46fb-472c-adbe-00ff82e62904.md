The thinking memory extraction process was updated to capture both Claude's internal reasoning (thinking blocks) and the corresponding text output that follows. This allows future sessions to see examples of "how I thought → what I produced" which helps shape Claude's future reasoning.

Key implementation details:
- Thinking and output are already in the same AssistantMessageEntry in transcripts
- ThinkingContent and TextContent blocks coexist in the same message
- Tool-only responses (with no text output) are now skipped
- Combined format: `## Thought\n\n{thinking}\n\n## Output\n\n{output}`

This provides concrete examples that are more useful than thinking blocks alone for guiding future reasoning.
