# Claude Transcript Storage Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Naming Convention

Project folder names are derived from the absolute working directory path by:
1. Converting path separators `/` to dashes `-`
2. Removing leading dashes
3. Converting to lowercase

Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `users-joe-code-syntessera-local-recall`

Transcript files are stored in subdirectories like `transcripts/` within the project folder.

This is useful when implementing transcript sync functionality for the MCP server daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes.
