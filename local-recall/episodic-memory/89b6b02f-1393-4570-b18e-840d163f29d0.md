The Local Recall plugin is organized in the `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/` directory with a dedicated skills subdirectory.

- **Skills Directory**: Contains individual skill files for plugin functionality
- **Plugin Metadata**: Updated to include better descriptions and usage information
- **Version Management**: Plugin version is tracked and bumped in configuration files

This structure allows for modular skill management and better discoverability when the plugin is published to marketplaces.
