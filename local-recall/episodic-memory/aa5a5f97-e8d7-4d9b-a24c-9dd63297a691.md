Local Recall follows a build-based deployment model:

- Source TypeScript files are in `src/` directory
- Compiled JavaScript bundles are output to `scripts/` directory (e.g., `scripts/hooks/`, `scripts/mcp-server/`)
- The bundles in `scripts/` are what get executed in production (by hooks, MCP server, etc.)
- `npm run build` compiles all TypeScript to JavaScript
- Development uses `npm run dev` for watch mode

Important: When modifying source code, the project must be rebuilt with `npm run build` for changes to take effect in production hooks and MCP server. This is a common point of confusion - editing src/ files won't affect running hooks until rebuild is done.
