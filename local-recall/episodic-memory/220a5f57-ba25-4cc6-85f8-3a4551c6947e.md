There is a dedicated prompts module (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) that contains the system prompts and instructions used by the memory-extractor. This separation allows for:

- Centralized management of extraction instructions
- Easy iteration on memory extraction quality
- Clear separation of concerns between prompt definition and API interaction
- Potential future versioning of prompts

The prompts module should be consulted when tuning memory extraction behavior or improving the quality of extracted memories.
