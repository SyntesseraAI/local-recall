# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes.

For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`
- Transcripts location: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with the naming pattern `transcript_<timestamp>.jsonl`.

Each line in a transcript is a JSON object representing a single event or message.

## Importance for MCP Server

The MCP server's background daemon syncs transcripts from this location to extract memories. Understanding this path format is critical for locating and processing transcripts.
