# Memory Extraction with Claude Haiku

The system uses Claude Haiku (via `claude -p --model haiku`) to:
1. Extract relevant information from transcripts
2. Generate keywords for memory searchability
3. Determine memory scope (global, file-specific, or area-specific)
4. Summarize and structure memory content

## Process

1. Raw transcript text is sent to Claude Haiku
2. Haiku analyzes the transcript and extracts key learnings
3. Returns structured metadata (keywords, scope, subject)
4. Memory is created with extracted information

This approach allows flexible, context-aware memory extraction rather than rigid pattern matching.
