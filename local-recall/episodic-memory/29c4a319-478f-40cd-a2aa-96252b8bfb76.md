Claude stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project directories are named with URL-encoded paths where slashes become dashes, matching the repo folder name. Example: `/Users/joe/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/` contains `transcripts/` with JSONL files like `2025-12-01.jsonl`. Each line is a separate JSON event object. The MCP server's background daemon syncs these transcripts every 5 minutes to extract memories.
