The BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) is automatically downloaded on first run and cached in `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` for subsequent runs. First startup may take 30-60 seconds, but this is normal. If the cache becomes corrupted (interrupted download), remove `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and the model will re-download automatically.
