The MemoryExtractor class in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` is responsible for:
1. Condensing transcripts into summarized events (User requests, Assistant responses, Tool invocations, Results)
2. Sending condensed transcripts to Claude for memory extraction
3. Generating memory objects with proper frontmatter (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash)
4. Validating extracted memories before storage

Key methods:
- `condenseTranscript()` - Summarizes transcript events
- `extractMemories()` - Calls Claude API with memory-extraction prompt
- `validateMemories()` - Ensures memory objects are properly formatted
