# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files where each line is a valid JSON object representing a single event:
- Each line contains one complete JSON object (no multi-line objects)
- Objects contain fields like `type`, `role`, `content`, etc.
- Files are named with timestamps or session identifiers

## Relevance

This is critical for the transcript-collector functionality, which needs to locate and parse Claude's transcript cache to extract memories asynchronously.
