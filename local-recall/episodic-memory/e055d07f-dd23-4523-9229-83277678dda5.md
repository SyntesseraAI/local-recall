# User Communication Preferences

When responding to the user, the assistant should:

1. **Identify the Problem Clearly**: State what the actual issue is, not just that something failed
2. **Provide Context**: Explain why the problem occurred or what conditions led to it
3. **Avoid Vague Feedback**: Don't just say "there was an error" without explaining what error or why

Example of good feedback:
- "The transcript-collector.ts file is incomplete - the function body is missing from line X onwards"

Example of poor feedback:
- "Something seems wrong with the file"

This helps the user understand the problem and take corrective action more efficiently.
