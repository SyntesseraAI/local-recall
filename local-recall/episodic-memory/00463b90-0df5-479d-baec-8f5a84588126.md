The fuzzy search in search.ts uses trigram-based similarity matching to find memories by keywords. It splits search queries into 3-character sequences and compares against indexed keywords. Results are scored and filtered by a configurable threshold (default 0.6). This enables flexible keyword matching without exact matches.
