During the Orama migration from SQLite, the gitignore file still contained outdated references to `memory.sqlite`, `sqlite-vec` native module bindings, and SQLite-specific artifacts.

**Changes Made**:
- Removed `memory.sqlite` pattern (no longer used with Orama)
- Removed `*.node` pattern for sqlite-vec native bindings
- Removed `build/` directory pattern (not used in project)
- Kept patterns for `local_cache/` (embedding model cache), `recall.log`, and build output

**Related File**: `src/utils/gitignore.ts` - the utility that generates this gitignore automatically also had these patterns removed in the corresponding source.
