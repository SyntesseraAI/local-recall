# Embedding Model Configuration

Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with the **BGE-small-en-v1.5 model** (~133MB) for semantic search capabilities.

## Key Details

- Model size: ~133MB
- Automatic download: Model is downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use
- Caching: Subsequent runs load from cache (much faster)
- First run: May take 30-60 seconds while model downloads
- Cache location: `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`

## Common Issues

**Tokenizer file not found error**: Usually caused by corrupted/incomplete cache from interrupted downloads. Fix by removing `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` directory.

## Purpose

Used for semantic search to find relevant memories based on meaning, not just keyword matching.
