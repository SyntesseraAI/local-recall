When extracting memories from sessions, prioritize:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Code patterns/conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

Keep memories atomic (one concept per memory), specific with file paths/function names, and actionable for future assistants.
