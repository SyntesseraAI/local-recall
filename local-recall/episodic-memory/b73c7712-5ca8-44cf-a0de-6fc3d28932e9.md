# User Preferences for Task Management

The user values:
1. **Task documentation** - Using TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks
2. **Progress visibility** - Clear tracking of what's in progress vs completed
3. **Immediate completion marking** - Mark tasks as completed as soon as they finish, not batch updates
4. **Single active task** - Only one task should be in_progress at a time

This preference is documented in the Claude Code system instructions and should be followed when planning complex work.
