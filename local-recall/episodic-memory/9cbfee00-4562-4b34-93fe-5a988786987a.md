# Transcript Format and Structure

## Overview

Claude Code transcripts are stored as JSONL files with each line representing a single event.

## Event Structure

Each event object contains:
- `type`: The type of event (e.g., "user-message", "assistant-message", "tool-call", "tool-result")
- `content`: The actual content of the event
- `timestamp`: When the event occurred
- Additional fields depending on event type

## Event Types

- **User Messages**: `type: "user-message"` - What the user asked or said
- **Assistant Messages**: `type: "assistant-message"` - Claude's response
- **Tool Calls**: `type: "tool-call"` - When Claude invokes a tool
- **Tool Results**: `type: "tool-result"` - Output from tool execution

## Processing Notes

When extracting memories from transcripts:
1. Parse JSONL format (one JSON object per line)
2. Group events by type for analysis
3. Look for patterns and learnings across tool results and responses
4. Extract actionable insights from problem-solving sequences
