Memory extraction intentionally avoids recording:
- Generic programming concepts that Claude already knows
- Temporary debugging steps that aren't useful long-term
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that would become outdated quickly

Instead, it focuses on local-recall-specific patterns, architectural decisions, configuration quirks, and lessons learned during the session that will help future AI assistants work more efficiently on this codebase.
