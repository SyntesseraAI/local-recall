The memory extraction process in local-recall uses transcript condensing before sending to Claude Haiku for memory analysis. This involves removing unnecessary details and tool execution output to focus on the meaningful interactions and decisions made during a session. The condensed transcript is then passed to an LLM prompt that guides memory extraction based on specific criteria (what was learned, what is now known, problems solved, etc.).

This approach improves the quality of extracted memories by reducing noise and context length while maintaining the essential information needed for future sessions.
