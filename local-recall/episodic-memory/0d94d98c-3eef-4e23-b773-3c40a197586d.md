Extraction prompts are centralized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to maintain consistency across all memory extraction operations. This file contains the prompt templates and guidelines that instruct Claude on what types of information to extract, how to structure memories, and what scopes to apply. Centralizing prompts makes them easy to update and refine for better extraction quality.
