Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows Claude Code and other AI tools via MCP to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. It uses SQLite with vector embeddings (fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic search. All memories are stored locally and version-controlled in the repository.

Key architecture components:
- Memory files stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` with YAML frontmatter
- Vector store using `better-sqlite3` and `sqlite-vec` for semantic similarity search
- Claude Code hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit) for context injection
- MCP server exposing memory tools to any MCP-compatible client
- Background daemon for processing transcripts and extracting memories
