Local Recall is a local markdown-powered memory system that enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions. It features:

- Structured memory files stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` with YAML frontmatter
- Three hook types: SessionStart (load index), UserPromptSubmit (search memories), Stop (parse transcripts)
- MCP server for exposing memory tools to compatible clients
- Fuzzy search with keyword-based index for finding relevant memories
- Background daemon that syncs transcripts and extracts memories every 5 minutes
- All memories are version-controlled git files, while index.json and recall.log are gitignored
