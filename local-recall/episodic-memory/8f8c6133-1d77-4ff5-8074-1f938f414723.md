Local Recall uses BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model via fastembed library for semantic search. Memories are stored with vector embeddings in SQLite database (memory.sqlite) allowing similarity-based searches. The vector store uses cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0, rounded to 2 decimal places) with recency tie-breaker when scores are equal.
