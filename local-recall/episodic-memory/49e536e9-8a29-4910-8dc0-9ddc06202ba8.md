# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) in the `transcripts/` directory.

Each line in the file is a JSON object representing a single event in the transcript.

## Relevance

This is critical for the `transcript-collector.ts` component which needs to sync and process transcripts from Claude's cache.
