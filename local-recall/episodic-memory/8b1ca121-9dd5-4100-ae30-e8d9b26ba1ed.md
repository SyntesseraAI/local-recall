Memory markdown files are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` and ARE version-controlled in git. They should be committed to the repository. The index (`local-recall/index.json`) and logs (`local-recall/recall.log`) are gitignored and auto-generated. This allows team members to share and build upon discovered memories across the project.
