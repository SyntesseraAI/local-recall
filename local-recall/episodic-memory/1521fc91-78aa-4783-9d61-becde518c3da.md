A new vector store module has been created to manage semantic embeddings of memory content. This module:

1. Generates embeddings for memory content using the BGE model
2. Stores embeddings alongside memory metadata
3. Provides similarity search using cosine distance
4. Integrates with the existing search module for combined keyword + semantic search

The vector store enables finding relevant memories based on semantic meaning, not just keyword matching. This is particularly useful when user queries contain different wording but similar concepts to stored memories.
