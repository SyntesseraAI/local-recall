# Code Style and Engineering Preferences

Based on project instructions in CLAUDE.md, the user prefers:

## Simplicity Over Abstraction

- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- Only make changes directly requested or clearly necessary
- Keep solutions simple and focused
- Three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction
- Don't add helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations
- Don't design for hypothetical future requirements

## Minimal Changes

- Don't add features beyond what was asked
- Don't refactor surrounding code for a bug fix
- Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to unchanged code
- Only add comments where logic isn't self-evident
- Don't add error handling for scenarios that can't happen
- Trust internal code and framework guarantees

## Backwards Compatibility

- Avoid backwards-compatibility hacks like renaming unused variables
- If something is unused, delete it completely
