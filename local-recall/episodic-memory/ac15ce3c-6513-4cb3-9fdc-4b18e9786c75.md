# User Preference: Emoji Usage

The project maintainer (Joe) prefers to avoid unnecessary emojis in code, documentation, and communication unless explicitly requested.

## Context

This preference was noted in CLAUDE.md instructions:
- "Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked."

## Application

When working on this project:
- Do not add emojis to code comments or documentation
- Do not add emojis to git commit messages
- Do not add emojis to error messages or logging output
- Only include emojis if the user specifically asks for them

This keeps the codebase clean and professional while respecting the user's style preferences.
