The TranscriptCondenser class takes raw transcripts and condenses them into structured events:
- `[User]` - User requests/questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses/explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool outcomes

This condensed format is used by the memory extraction system to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. The condenser removes verbose content while preserving essential information about what was accomplished.
