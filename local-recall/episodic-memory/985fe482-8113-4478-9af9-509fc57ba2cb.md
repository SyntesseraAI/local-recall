The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to extract keywords and subjects from transcript content. The `extractMemoryFromTranscript` function calls Claude with a prompt to generate relevant keywords and a brief subject line. This happens during the transcript processing pipeline and is critical for making memories searchable and indexed properly.
