The memory extraction system keeps prompts in a separate `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` file rather than inline in the extractor code. This allows:

- Easy prompt iteration and refinement without modifying core extraction logic
- Clear separation between prompt engineering and implementation
- Centralized location for all memory extraction prompt templates
- Reduces cognitive load in the main extractor file

This pattern should be followed when adding new extraction prompt types.
