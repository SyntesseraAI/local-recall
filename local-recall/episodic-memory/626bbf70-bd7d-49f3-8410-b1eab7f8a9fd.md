Local Recall uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use (30-60 seconds initial download). If tokenizer file errors occur, remove `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to force re-download.
