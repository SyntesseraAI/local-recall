When hooks like Stop are unavailable (e.g., in VS Code extension), memories can still be created using MCP server tools, specifically `episodic_create`. This provides a fallback mechanism for memory creation that works across different environments and integrations. The MCP server runs as a background daemon and also processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes.
