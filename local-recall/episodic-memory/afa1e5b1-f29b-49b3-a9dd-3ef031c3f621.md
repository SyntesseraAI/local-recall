# Embedding Model Configuration

Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search capabilities.

## Model Details

- **Model Name**: BGE-small-en-v1.5
- **Library**: fastembed
- **Size**: ~133MB
- **Cache Location**: `local_cache/`

## First Run Behavior

On first startup, the model is automatically downloaded to the `local_cache/` directory. This initial download may take 30-60 seconds. Subsequent runs load the model from cache, making startup much faster.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter a "Tokenizer file not found" error:
1. Remove the corrupted cache: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*`
2. The model will automatically re-download on the next run

This error typically occurs from interrupted downloads or corrupted cache files.
