Memory extraction instructions are centralized in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts. These prompts define how Claude should analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories, including guidelines about what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, conventions) and what to avoid (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data). The prompts ensure consistent memory quality across extractions.
