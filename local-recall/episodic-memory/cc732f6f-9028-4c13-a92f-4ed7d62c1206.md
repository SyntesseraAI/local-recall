The memory extraction process has specific guidelines about what should and shouldn't be extracted:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Project-specific code patterns and conventions
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences
- Component relationships
- Performance considerations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

This ensures memories are actionable, specific to the codebase, and provide genuine value for future sessions.
