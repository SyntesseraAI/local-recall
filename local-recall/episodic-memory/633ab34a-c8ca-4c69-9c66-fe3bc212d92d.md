DO extract: architectural decisions and reasoning, bug fixes with root cause analysis, code patterns specific to the project, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, and performance optimizations. DO NOT extract: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, trivial information, sensitive data (API keys, passwords), or information that would become outdated quickly. Focus on memories that help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently.
