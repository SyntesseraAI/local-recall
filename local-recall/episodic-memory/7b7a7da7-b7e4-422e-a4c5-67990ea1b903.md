Memory extraction prompts are defined in a dedicated prompt file (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) that is imported and used by the memory extractor. This centralization allows for easy updates to extraction logic without modifying the extractor code itself, and enables prompt reuse across different extraction contexts.
