Local Recall uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. The model automatically downloads to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use (takes 30-60 seconds), then loads from cache on subsequent runs. If tokenizer file is missing or corrupted, delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` directory to re-download.
