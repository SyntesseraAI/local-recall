Memory extraction is part of the broader transcript processing pipeline:

- The MCP server background daemon processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes
- Transcripts are synced from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
- The memory-extractor module processes complete transcripts and generates memories
- Extracted memories are persisted as markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
- Content hashes are used for deduplication - if transcript content hasn't changed, no new memories are extracted
- This ensures the memory system grows over time without creating duplicates
