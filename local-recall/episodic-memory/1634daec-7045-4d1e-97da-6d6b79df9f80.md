The SessionStart hook uses MemoryManager.listMemories() to load memories directly from disk without initializing the vector store. This avoids slow initialization on every session start. It returns the 5 most recent memories (sorted by occurred_at) to be injected into Claude's context. This is a full reload approach, not incremental.
