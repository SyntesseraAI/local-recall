The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. It sends condensed transcripts to Claude Haiku along with a structured extraction prompt that asks Claude to identify learnings, discoveries, and solutions from the session. The system expects JSON-formatted memory objects back from Claude.
