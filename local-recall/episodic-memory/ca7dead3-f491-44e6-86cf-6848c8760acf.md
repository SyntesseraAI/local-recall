Memory files stored in local-recall/episodic-memory/*.md are VERSION-CONTROLLED and WILL be committed to git. This is intentional design - memories are project knowledge that team members should share.

The index (local-recall/index.json) and recall.log are gitignored as they are auto-generated. Only the memory markdown files and .gitignore should be in version control.
