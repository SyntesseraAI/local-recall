# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name uses the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: Project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` maps to `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory:
- Located at: `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`
- Format: JSONL (one JSON object per line)
- Each transcript contains events from a Claude Code session

## File Structure

Each transcript file contains:
- Session metadata
- User prompts
- Claude responses
- Tool invocations and results
- Timestamps and session information

This is important for the memory extraction daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously.
