The memory extraction process in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the claude-sdk to invoke Claude Haiku for analyzing transcripts. The MemoryExtractor class processes condensed transcripts and uses a configured prompt to extract actionable memories that will help future AI assistants. This is the core mechanism for building the memory system.
