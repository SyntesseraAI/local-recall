# Keyword Extraction for Memory Processing

The system uses Claude Haiku model to extract keywords from transcripts for memory creation.

## Process

1. Transcript text is sent to Claude Haiku with a prompt asking for keyword extraction
2. Haiku returns a JSON array of relevant keywords
3. These keywords are used to index memories for later semantic search

## Implementation Notes

- The `claude -p` command is used with the haiku model
- Prompt is designed to extract 5-10 concise, searchable keywords
- Keywords should be lowercase and specific to the content
- Used in both user-prompt-submit hook and memory creation workflows

## Performance Consideration

Using Haiku for keyword extraction is efficient and cost-effective compared to larger models, while still providing good keyword quality for memory search.
