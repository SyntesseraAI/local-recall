Thinking memories store Claude's internal reasoning blocks alongside their corresponding text outputs. Each thinking memory has two sections: 'Thought' (the internal reasoning) and 'Output' (the text response). These memories are extracted from transcripts and help future sessions understand how similar problems were approached.
