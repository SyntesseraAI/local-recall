Local Recall uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use. First run may take 30-60 seconds while downloading. Subsequent runs load from cache.

**Troubleshooting**: If tokenizer file not found error occurs, remove corrupted cache with `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and model will re-download automatically.
