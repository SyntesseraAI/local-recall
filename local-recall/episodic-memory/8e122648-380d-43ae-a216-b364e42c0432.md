Merged two separate hooks (`user-prompt-submit.ts` and `user-prompt-submit-thinking.ts`) into a single unified `user-prompt-submit.ts` hook that dynamically selects whether to search episodic memories, thinking memories, or both based on configuration.

Old approach: Two separate hook files that operated independently
New approach: Single hook reads config flags `episodicEnabled` and `thinkingEnabled` to determine behavior at runtime

Deleted file: `src/hooks/user-prompt-submit-thinking.ts`
