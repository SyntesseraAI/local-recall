# Memory Extraction Triggers

Memory extraction from transcripts can be triggered not just at session end, but also when analyzing user prompts. The system uses Claude Haiku to extract keywords from user input and can then generate memories based on what the user is asking about.

This allows for more reactive and contextual memory creation during a session, not just batch processing at the end.
