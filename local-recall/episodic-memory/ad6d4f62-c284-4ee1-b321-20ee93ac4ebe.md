Memory extraction in local-recall uses Claude Haiku via the `claude -p` command to analyze transcripts and generate memories. The extraction process uses a dedicated prompt file at `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides the model on what constitutes a valuable memory. This approach ensures consistent, high-quality memory generation across sessions.
