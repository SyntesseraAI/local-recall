The memory-extractor module uses the Claude API (claude-3-5-sonnet model) with streaming enabled to extract memories from transcripts. The streaming approach allows incremental processing and response handling, which is important for handling large transcripts efficiently. Uses the prompt from src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts to guide the extraction process.
