The memory extraction process uses a detailed system prompt stored in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides Claude Haiku in analyzing transcripts. The prompt defines:

- What constitutes valuable memories vs trivial information
- Specific guidance on scope (`global`, `file:`, `area:`)
- Rules for keyword selection (specific, searchable, lowercase)
- Examples of what to extract vs what to skip
- Expected JSON output format

This prompt is critical for consistent, high-quality memory extraction across sessions.
