# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Forward slashes are replaced with dashes
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full transcript path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (`.jsonl` extension):
- Each line is a JSON object representing a single event
- Events include user messages, assistant responses, and tool invocations
- Organized chronologically within each transcript file

## Relevance to local-recall

The transcript-collector module needs to:
1. Determine the current working directory
2. Transform it to the expected folder name format (path → folder name conversion)
3. Access transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/{folder-name}/transcripts/`
4. Parse JSONL format to extract and process transcript events

This is critical for the MCP server's background daemon which syncs and processes transcripts every 5 minutes.
