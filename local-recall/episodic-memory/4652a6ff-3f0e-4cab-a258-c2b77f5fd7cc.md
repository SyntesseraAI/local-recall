# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

Transcripts are condensed into structured events to make memory extraction more efficient:

## Event Types

- `[User]` - What the user asked or requested
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude said or explained
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

## Purpose

This condensed format:
- Reduces token usage when processing transcripts with Claude
- Maintains essential information needed for memory extraction
- Makes it easier to identify key learning moments
- Filters out verbose explanations that aren't useful for memories

## Implementation

The `transcript-collector.ts` file implements the transcript condensing logic. It reads raw JSONL transcripts and converts them to this condensed event format.
