The memory extraction process explicitly filters out generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious/trivial information, sensitive data, and outdated information. The system focuses on extracting architecture decisions, bug fixes with root cause analysis, project-specific patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, and performance optimizations. This filtering ensures memories remain useful and actionable for future sessions.
