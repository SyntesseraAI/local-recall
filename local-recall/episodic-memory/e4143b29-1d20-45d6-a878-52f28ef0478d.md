The memory extraction system can receive transcripts containing nested `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` markers. This indicates the system is designed to handle recursive or iterative memory extraction requests. When analyzing transcripts, be prepared to process multiple levels of memory extraction markers and extract only the most relevant and actionable memories from the content.
