# Embedding-Based Semantic Search Implementation

Local Recall uses semantic search powered by the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model via fastembeds library.

## Vector Store Setup

- **Library**: fastembeds
- **Model**: BGE-small-en-v1.5 (lightweight, ~133MB)
- **Purpose**: Convert memories and queries to embeddings for semantic similarity matching
- **Cache Location**: `local_cache/` directory (auto-downloaded on first use)

## Components

- `src/core/embedding.ts` - Handles embedding generation
- `src/core/vector-store.ts` - Manages vector storage and similarity search

## Performance Considerations

- First startup downloads the model (~133MB), which takes 30-60 seconds
- Subsequent runs use cached model for fast performance
- Semantic search provides more relevant results than keyword-only matching
- Can be combined with fuzzy keyword search for hybrid approach
