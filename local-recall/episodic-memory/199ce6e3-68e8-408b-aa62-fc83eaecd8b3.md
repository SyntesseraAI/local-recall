The MCP server daemon in src/mcp-server/server.ts runs background tasks on startup with specific delays:

1. **Vector sync**: Runs 2 seconds after server start, then every 10 minutes (line 169-193)
2. **Transcript processing**: Runs 5 seconds after server start, then every 5 minutes

These delays allow the server to fully initialize before processing begins. Each Claude Code instance spawns its own MCP server process via stdio transport.
