Local Recall integrates with Claude Code via three hooks:
1. **SessionStart**: Loads 5 most recent memories on session start
2. **UserPromptSubmit**: Performs semantic search on user prompts using vector store
3. **Stop**: Disabled by default; memory extraction handled by MCP server daemon

Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json` and output memory content to stdout for injection into Claude's context.
