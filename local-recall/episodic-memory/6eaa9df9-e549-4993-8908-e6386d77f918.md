The memory extractor module at src/core/memory-extractor.ts uses the Claude API (specifically the Messages API) to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. It processes condensed transcripts where events are formatted as [User], [Assistant], and [Tool: Name] entries. The extractor constructs prompts using claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 model and sends them to Claude for memory extraction.
