Memories are deduplicated using two fields: `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp of when the memory event occurred) and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix). Before creating a new memory, the system checks for existing memories with the same `occurred_at` and `content_hash` combination via `findDuplicate()`. This prevents duplicate memory creation when the same transcript is processed multiple times.
