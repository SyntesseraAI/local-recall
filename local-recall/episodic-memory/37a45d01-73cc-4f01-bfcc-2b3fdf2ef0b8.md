# Transcript Collector Architecture

The `TranscriptCollector` in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` is responsible for syncing transcripts from Claude's project cache.

## Key Process

1. Reads from `~/.claude/projects/<project-id>/transcripts/` where Claude stores project conversation transcripts
2. Returns an array of transcript files with their paths
3. Works with the MCP server's background daemon to periodically sync new transcripts

## Important Notes

- Uses proper path conversion to locate the correct project directory
- JSONL format expected from Claude's transcript storage
- Part of the larger memory extraction pipeline (transcript → condense → extract → store)
- Currently used by the MCP server daemon which runs every 5 minutes
