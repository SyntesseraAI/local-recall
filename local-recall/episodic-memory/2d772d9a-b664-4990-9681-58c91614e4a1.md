Fixed critical bug where thinking content was being dropped during transcript parsing. The issue: `stop.ts` was checking `c.text` property for thinking blocks, but thinking blocks actually use `c.thinking` property. The p-tag-based parsing in `parseTranscript()` correctly identifies thinking blocks, but the content extraction logic in downstream code was using wrong property accessor. This caused all thinking content to be silently dropped from memory extraction.
