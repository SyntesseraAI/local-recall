# Claude Project Transcript Storage

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS with folder names derived from the absolute working directory path.

## Path Naming Convention

The project folder name is converted from the absolute path using a specific format. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `users-joe-code-syntessera-local-recall` (lowercase, forward slashes converted to hyphens)

This allows the transcript collector to reliably find transcripts for background processing.
