Memory extraction is a core component of the local-recall system that processes Claude Code session transcripts to automatically create memories. This functionality enables the system to learn from past sessions and make that knowledge available to future sessions. The extraction happens asynchronously and converts unstructured transcript data into structured, searchable memory records.
