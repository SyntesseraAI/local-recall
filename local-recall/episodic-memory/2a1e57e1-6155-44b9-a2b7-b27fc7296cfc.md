Local Recall integrates with Claude Code via hooks:
- SessionStart: Loads 5 most recent memories (no vector store, just full reload)
- UserPromptSubmit: Performs semantic search using vector store (lazy initialized)
Both hooks output memory content to stdout for injection into Claude's context.
The Stop hook is currently disabled - memory extraction is handled by MCP server daemon processing transcripts every 5 minutes.
