The transcript collector had debug-level logging that wasn't visible by default. Users couldn't see if transcripts were being found when setting up in a new repo. Solution: Added INFO-level logging at key points:

1. When starting the search (showing which path is being searched)
2. When checking if Claude projects directory exists
3. Showing how many transcripts were found (or if none were found)
4. Providing sync summary with results

This makes the transcript discovery process transparent and helps diagnose issues in new repo setups.
