Claude stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project folders use a URL-encoded path format where slashes become dashes (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`). Transcript files are named with UUIDs and use `.jsonl` extension (e.g., `086dd549-7...jsonl`). Each line in the file is a JSON event object representing a single interaction in the session.
