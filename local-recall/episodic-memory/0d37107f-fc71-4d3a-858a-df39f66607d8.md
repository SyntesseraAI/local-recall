The Local Recall MCP server runs a background daemon that:
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache every 5 minutes
- Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change

This is the primary mechanism for extracting memories from coding sessions, replacing the Stop hook which is currently disabled.
