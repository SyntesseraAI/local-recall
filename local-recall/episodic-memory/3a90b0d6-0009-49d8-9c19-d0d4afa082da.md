# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working path with slashes converted to dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (JSON Lines format) within this project folder, with one JSON object per line representing session events.

## Importance

Understanding this location and naming convention is critical for:
- Building transcript collectors that sync Claude's memory across projects
- Debugging transcript processing in the MCP server
- Understanding how Local Recall integrates with Claude Code's caching system
