SessionStart hook loads 5 most recent memories on session begin. UserPromptSubmit hook performs semantic search using vector embeddings when user submits a prompt. Stop hook is currently disabled; memory extraction is handled by MCP server daemon which processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json` as shell commands receiving JSON via stdin.
