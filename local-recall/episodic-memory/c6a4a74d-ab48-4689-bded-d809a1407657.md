# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files where each line is a complete JSON object representing a single event in the session.

This is useful for:
- Extracting memories from completed sessions
- Analyzing user interactions and patterns
- Building context for future sessions
- Debugging assistant behavior
