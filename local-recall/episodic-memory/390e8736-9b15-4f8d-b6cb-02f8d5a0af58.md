Project development standards:
- All new features must have corresponding unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests go in `tests/integration/`
- Documentation must be placed in the `docs/` folder
- Update existing docs when modifying functionality
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases
- This is a strict requirement for all contributions
