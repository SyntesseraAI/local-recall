# Transcript Condensing Feature

A new feature was implemented to condense transcript content for memory extraction purposes.

## Purpose

The transcript condensing feature reduces transcript verbosity by converting detailed interaction logs into condensed events, making it easier to extract meaningful memories.

## Event Format

Condensed transcripts use a simplified event format:
- `[User]` - User's question or request
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's response or explanation
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

## Benefits

- Reduces context length for memory analysis
- Makes transcript patterns clearer
- Improves memory extraction quality
- Easier for downstream processing

## Location

Implemented in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`
