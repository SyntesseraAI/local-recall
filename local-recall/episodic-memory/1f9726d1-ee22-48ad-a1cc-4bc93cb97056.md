The memory extraction system prevents duplicate memories by:

1. Computing a content hash (SHA-256 prefix) of the memory content
2. Using the `occurred_at` timestamp as a deduplication key
3. Checking for existing memories with matching `occurred_at` and `content_hash`
4. Only creating new memories if no duplicate is found
5. This ensures idempotent memory creation even if transcripts are processed multiple times
