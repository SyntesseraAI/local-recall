# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Project path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`
- Transcript files: `*.jsonl` format

## Transcript File Structure

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) format with:
- Each line is a JSON object representing an event
- Events include user messages, assistant responses, tool calls
- Files are named with timestamps or session identifiers

## Relevance to local-recall

The transcript-collector.ts module reads from this location to sync and process transcripts for memory extraction in the local-recall system.
