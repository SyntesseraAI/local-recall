Development requirements: Node.js 18+, TypeScript 5.9+. All new features must include unit tests in `tests/unit/` and integration tests in `tests/integration/`. Documentation goes in `docs/` folder. Tests should cover happy paths and edge cases. Build scripts: `npm run build`, `npm run dev` (watch mode), `npm test`.
