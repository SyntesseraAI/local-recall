The transcript collection system includes a condensing step that removes redundant tool outputs and verbose details before sending transcripts to Claude for memory extraction. This preprocessing step significantly reduces token usage while preserving the essential information needed for memory generation. The condensed format uses markers like `[Tool: Name]` and `[Result: OK/ERROR]` to compactly represent transcript events.
