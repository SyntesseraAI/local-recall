The SessionStart hook is triggered when a Claude Code session begins:

1. Receives JSON input with `session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`
2. Loads all memories from disk via `MemoryManager.listMemories()`
3. Returns the 5 most recent memories sorted by `occurred_at`
4. Outputs memory content to stdout (injected into Claude's context)

Note: This is a full reload, not incremental. The vector store is NOT used here to avoid slow initialization on every session start - it uses simple file-based listing instead.
