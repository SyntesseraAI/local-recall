Memory files are stored as individual markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. Each file:
- Has a UUID filename (e.g., `06d3d87a-025d-49fe-95c7-0bd08e78ad13.md`)
- Contains YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Is tracked in git (version-controlled)
- Follows a consistent markdown structure
- Uses unique IDs and content hashes for deduplication
