# User Preferences for Memory Extraction

When extracting memories from transcripts:
1. Be specific - Include file paths, function names, and concrete details
2. Be concise - Each memory should focus on one concept
3. Be actionable - Memories should help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently

User values efficient, focused memory extraction that captures the essence of discoveries without generic programming knowledge or temporary debugging steps.
