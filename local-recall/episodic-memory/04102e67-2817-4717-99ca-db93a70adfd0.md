The memory extractor includes logic to condense transcripts before processing (to avoid token limits), and uses content hashing and occurred_at timestamps to prevent duplicate memories from being created. When a memory already exists (based on content_hash and occurred_at), the extractor returns the existing memory instead of creating a new one.
