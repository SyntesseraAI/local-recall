# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is created by taking the absolute working directory path and replacing slashes with dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) where each line is a separate JSON object representing a transcript event.

## Usage in Local Recall

The transcript collector needs to account for this path normalization when scanning for transcripts to process, especially when running across different projects.
