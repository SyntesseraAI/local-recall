Memory extraction uses a prompt template system (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) that:
- Provides clear instructions to Claude for identifying valuable memories
- Includes examples of good vs bad memories
- Specifies JSON output format requirements
- Focuses extraction on architectural decisions, bug fixes, and codebase patterns
- Avoids extracting generic knowledge or sensitive data

The prompt guides Claude to extract memories that are:
- Specific with concrete details (file paths, function names)
- Concise and focused on single concepts
- Actionable for future assistants
- Properly scoped (global, file-specific, or area-specific)
