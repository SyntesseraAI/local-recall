The initial startup may take 30-60 seconds while the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) downloads and caches. Subsequent runs load from local_cache/ directly.

If 'Tokenizer file not found' error occurs, the cache is corrupted - delete local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5* and the model will re-download on next run.
