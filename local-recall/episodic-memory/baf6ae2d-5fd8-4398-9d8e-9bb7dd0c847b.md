The codebase follows a modular architecture with separate concerns:
- `memory-extractor.ts`: Handles API communication and memory generation from transcripts
- `transcript-collector.ts`: Handles transcript collection and processing

This separation allows each module to focus on a specific responsibility and makes the system more maintainable and testable.
