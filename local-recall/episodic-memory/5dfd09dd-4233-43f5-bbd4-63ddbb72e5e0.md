# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files with the format:
- Each line is a complete JSON object representing one event
- Files are incrementally written (append-only)
- Filename format appears to be based on session timestamp or identifier

## Usage in Local Recall

The transcript-collector module needs to understand this path structure to:
1. Locate transcripts for the current project
2. Read and parse `.jsonl` transcript files
3. Extract memories from completed sessions
4. Avoid reprocessing already-extracted transcripts
