The memory extractor module uses the Claude API to process transcripts and extract memories. It implements a MemoryExtractor class that sends transcript content to Claude with a system prompt that instructs Claude to return JSON with a specific structure. The extraction process is used by the MCP server daemon to automatically process session transcripts every 5 minutes and create persistent memories.
