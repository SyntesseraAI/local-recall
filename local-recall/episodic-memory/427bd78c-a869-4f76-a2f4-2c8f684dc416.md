# Embedding Model Configuration

Local Recall uses `fastembed` library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search capabilities.

## Model Details

- **Model**: BGE-small-en-v1.5 (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5)
- **Size**: ~133MB
- **Cache Location**: `local_cache/` directory (auto-created)
- **First Run**: 30-60 seconds for initial download, cached afterwards

## Important Notes

- Model is automatically downloaded on first use
- Cached in `local_cache/` for fast subsequent access
- If tokenizer file error occurs, delete the cache directory and it will re-download
- Used primarily for semantic memory search rather than exact keyword matching

## Architecture

The vector store implementation (`src/core/vector-store.ts`) handles embedding generation and similarity search using this model.
