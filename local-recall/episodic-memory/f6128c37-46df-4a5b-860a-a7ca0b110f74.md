# User Preferences and Patterns

## Logging and Debugging

- User values verbose, detailed logging for debugging purposes
- Logs are written to files (e.g., `recall.log`) for persistent reference
- Debugging information is valuable for understanding system behavior

## Code Patterns and Style

- Async operations are preferred and should be properly handled
- Error handling and reliability are important considerations
- User is detail-oriented and prefers understanding system internals

## Development Approach

- Incremental testing and validation
- Understanding requirements thoroughly before implementation
- Preference for clean, well-documented code
