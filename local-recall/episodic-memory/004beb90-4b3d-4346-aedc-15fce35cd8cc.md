Each memory file is stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` with a markdown format containing YAML frontmatter. Memories have fields: id (UUID), subject (one-line description), keywords (array for search), applies_to (scope), occurred_at (ISO-8601), and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix). Memory files ARE version-controlled and will be committed to git, unlike the auto-generated `index.json` which is gitignored.
