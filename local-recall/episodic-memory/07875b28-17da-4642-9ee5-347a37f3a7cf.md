The memory extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` defines:

- Guidelines for what should and shouldn't be extracted from transcripts
- Rules for memory content structure (subject, keywords, applies_to, content)
- Scope rules: `global`, `file:<path>`, `area:<name>`
- Instructions for being specific, concise, and actionable
- DO extract: architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, user preferences, relationships
- DO NOT extract: generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data, outdated info

This prompt is used by the memory extractor to consistently generate quality memories.
