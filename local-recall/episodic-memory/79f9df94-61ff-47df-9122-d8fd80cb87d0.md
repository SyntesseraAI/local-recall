# MCP Server Background Daemon

The MCP server runs a background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously rather than synchronously:

## Processing Cycle
- Runs every 5 minutes
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
- Uses `claude -p` to extract memories from transcripts
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change

## Implications
- The Stop hook is disabled in favor of async processing
- Memory extraction is delayed but doesn't block user sessions
- Multiple sessions can contribute memories without blocking each other
- Content hashing prevents duplicate memory creation for unchanged transcripts
