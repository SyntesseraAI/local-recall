When contributing to Local Recall:
- All new features must have corresponding unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests go in `tests/integration/`
- Documentation must be placed in `docs/` folder
- Update existing docs when modifying functionality
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases
- Memory files should have relevant, specific keywords
- Consider scope carefully: `global` vs `file:` vs `area:`
