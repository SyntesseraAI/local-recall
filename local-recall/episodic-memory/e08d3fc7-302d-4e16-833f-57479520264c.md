The memory extraction prompt (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) defines the guidelines and criteria for extracting memories from transcripts. It specifies what should be extracted (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks) and what should NOT be extracted (generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, sensitive data). The prompt emphasizes being specific with file paths and function names, being concise with one concept per memory, and being actionable.
