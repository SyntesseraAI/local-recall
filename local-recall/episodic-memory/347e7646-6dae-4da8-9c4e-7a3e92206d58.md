The SessionStart hook loads all memories from disk via `MemoryManager.listMemories()` and returns the 5 most recent memories (sorted by `occurred_at`) to Claude's context. This is a full reload, not incremental. The vector store is intentionally NOT used here to avoid slow initialization on every session start. The hook receives session_id, transcript_path, and cwd as JSON input.
