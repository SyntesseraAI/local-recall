Claude stores transcripts in different locations depending on OS and version:
- **macOS**: `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder-name>/transcripts/` 
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\projects\<project-folder-name>\transcripts\`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/projects/<project-folder-name>/transcripts/`

Transcript files are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) format, where each line is a complete JSON object representing a turn in the conversation.

The project folder name is derived from the working directory name, NOT the full path. For example, a project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` would have transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/local-recall/transcripts/`.
