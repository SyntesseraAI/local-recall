# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the project's file path using a deterministic encoding:
- The project's working directory path is hashed to generate a unique folder name
- For example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` maps to a specific folder in `~/.claude/projects/`
- The folder contains `transcripts/` subdirectory with JSONL files

## File Structure

Each transcript is stored as a JSONL (JSON Lines) file:
- One JSON object per line representing a conversation turn
- Format: `{"role": "user|assistant", "content": "..."}` or similar structure
- Files are named sequentially or by session ID

## Implications for Local Recall

- The `transcript-collector.ts` module needs to compute the same hash to locate transcripts
- Transcripts can be collected and processed asynchronously by the MCP server
- The location is platform-specific (`~/.claude/` path varies by OS)
