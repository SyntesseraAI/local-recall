Claude transcript files contain events with these structure:
- Each line is a JSON object representing a conversation turn
- Keys include: `type`, `content`, `timestamp`, etc.
- User messages have specific structure
- Assistant messages contain response content
- Tool calls and results are represented as events

When processing transcripts for memory extraction:
- The session transcript file is the authoritative source of conversation
- Must parse JSONL format correctly
- Session data should be extracted to understand context
- Use transcript data to identify what was learned and decided during the session
