Memory extraction from transcripts should follow specific guidelines:

**Extraction Focus:**
- What was learned and important facts about codebase
- Specific patterns, configurations, quirks unique to this codebase
- Problems solved, bugs fixed, and their solutions

**Scope Classification:**
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

**What to Extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations

**What NOT to Extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Quickly outdated information

**Output Format:**
Return ONLY valid JSON with "memories" array containing objects with: `subject` (max 200 chars), `keywords` (1-10 lowercase), `applies_to` (scope string), and `content` (markdown format).
