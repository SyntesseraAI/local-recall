The Claude Haiku model used in the local-recall project has a 5-hour token limit that resets daily at 1am Europe/London time. This is a hard constraint on how much work can be done in a single session. Future assistants should be aware of this limitation when planning tasks and may need to defer work if approaching the limit.
