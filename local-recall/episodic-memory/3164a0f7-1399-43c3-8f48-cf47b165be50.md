Memory extraction uses structured prompts that define the expected output format including YAML frontmatter fields (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash) and specific guidelines for what constitutes valuable memories. The prompts include examples and clear instructions for scope determination (global vs file vs area).
