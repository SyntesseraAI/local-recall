The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku to extract keywords from transcripts. It sends a structured prompt that asks the model to identify 5-10 relevant keywords from session content. The extracted keywords are then used to populate the memory's keyword field for searchability.
