## Memory Extraction from Session Transcripts

The local-recall system's primary function is to analyze Claude Code session transcripts to automatically extract valuable memories. Key points:

- **Automatic processing**: The MCP server daemon processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes
- **Input source**: Transcripts are read from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
- **Analysis**: Claude is used to identify what should be remembered from each session
- **Output**: Structured memory files are created in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
- **Purpose**: Enables future Claude Code sessions to benefit from learnings, discoveries, and solutions from previous work
- **Change detection**: Uses content hashes to track when transcripts change and update/delete corresponding memories

This is the core value proposition of the project - learning from past interactions.
