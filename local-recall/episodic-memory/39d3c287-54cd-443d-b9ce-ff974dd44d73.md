The memory extraction system is designed to capture information that is specific to the local-recall codebase and helpful for future AI assistants. It deliberately avoids extracting:
- Generic programming knowledge that Claude already possesses
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that will become outdated quickly

This keeps the memory store focused and valuable rather than bloated with generic content.
