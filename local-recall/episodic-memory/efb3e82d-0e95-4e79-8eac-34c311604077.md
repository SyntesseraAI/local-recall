The `parseTranscriptForMemories(rawContent: string): MemorySuggestion[]` function (lines 377-413) is the primary entry point for processing transcripts:

1. Takes raw JSONL string as input (as read from transcript file)
2. Parses each line as a JSON entry with `type`, `timestamp`, and `message` fields
3. Extracts text and thinking blocks from content arrays
4. Calls `analyzeForMemories()` to filter and create memory suggestions
5. Returns array of MemorySuggestion objects ready to be saved

This centralizes transcript parsing logic so it can be reused by stop.ts hook, MCP server, or any other component that needs to process transcripts.
