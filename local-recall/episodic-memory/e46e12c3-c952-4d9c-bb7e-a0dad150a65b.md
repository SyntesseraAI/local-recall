# User Preference: Direct Communication About Unmatched Information

## Preference Statement

When asked to perform a task (especially analyzing transcripts), if the provided information doesn't match what's expected or needed:
- Respond directly about what was received
- Explain what the mismatch is
- Don't try to infer or work around incomplete information
- Be transparent about limitations

## Example

In this session, the user provided a transcript snippet that was truncated mid-sentence. Rather than trying to guess the rest or process partial information, the assistant should have noted this immediately.

## Application to AI Development

This preference indicates the user values:
- Accuracy over attempting helpfulness
- Transparency about data quality issues
- Clear communication about what can and cannot be done
- Early feedback when information is insufficient
