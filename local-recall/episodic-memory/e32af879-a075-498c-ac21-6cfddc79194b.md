Local Recall creates a persistent memory layer that allows multiple AI agents to store and retrieve contextual information about the codebase, share knowledge across different coding sessions, and maintain project-specific memories that improve over time. All memories are stored locally within the repository, making them version-controllable and shareable among team members.
