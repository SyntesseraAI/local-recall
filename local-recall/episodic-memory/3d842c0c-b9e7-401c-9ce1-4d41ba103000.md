When adding new features:
- Unit tests go in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests go in `tests/integration/`
- Documentation goes in `docs/` folder
- Update existing docs when modifying functionality
- Tests must cover both happy paths and edge cases
- All new features must have corresponding tests

Run with: `npm test`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`
