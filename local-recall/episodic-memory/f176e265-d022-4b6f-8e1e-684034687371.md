Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools (via MCP) to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files stored in the local-recall/episodic-memory/ directory. Uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search via SQLite vector store with better-sqlite3 and sqlite-vec extension. All memories are version-controlled.
