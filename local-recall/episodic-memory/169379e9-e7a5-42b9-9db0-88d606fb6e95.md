The memory extraction system uses `claude -p` with Haiku model to process transcripts. The extraction logic is in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` and uses prompt templates defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. The system extracts memories from condensed transcripts containing [User], [Assistant], [Tool], and [Result] events.
