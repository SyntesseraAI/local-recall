On session startup, the system performs a **full reload** rather than a delta load. The session-start hook (lines 57-63) creates a fresh MemoryManager instance, calls listMemories() to get all memories from disk, then sorts by occurred_at descending and takes only the 5 most recent memories for context injection.

This means every session starts with the same approach regardless of what was loaded in the previous session.
