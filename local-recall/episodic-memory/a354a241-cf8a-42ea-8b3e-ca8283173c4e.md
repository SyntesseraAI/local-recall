# Communication Style Preference

The user prefers concise, direct communication without unnecessary verbosity or repetition. 

## Implications for Future Sessions

- Avoid lengthy preambles or explanations
- Get to the point quickly
- Don't repeat information unnecessarily
- Focus on actionable information
- Be efficient with context and explanations

## Example

Instead of: "Let me explain the concept of async generators and how they work in detail..."

Better: "You need to implement `transcriptFilePath` as an async generator."
