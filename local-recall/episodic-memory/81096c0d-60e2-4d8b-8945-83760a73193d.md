The thinking extraction pipeline now successfully:
1. Processes 59+ transcripts from the session history
2. Extracts and creates 600+ thinking memories
3. Stores each memory with `## Thought` and `## Output` sections in markdown
4. Groups related thinking blocks with their corresponding assistant text responses
5. Maintains JSONL-based tracking via `thinking-processed-log.jsonl`

Thinking memories store 'how I thought → what I produced' pairs, providing examples of reasoning patterns that help future sessions tackle similar problems.
