The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude's API (via `claude -p` command) with a structured prompt to analyze transcripts and generate memories. The extraction happens asynchronously and leverages the system prompt defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to ensure consistent, high-quality memory creation from session transcripts.
