# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Slashes (/) are replaced with hyphens (-)
- The full path becomes the folder name
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format):
- One JSON object per line
- Each line represents a transcript event
- Files are located in the project-specific folder under `~/.claude/projects/`

## Integration with Local Recall

This is critical for Local Recall's MCP server:
- The background daemon syncs transcripts from this cache location
- It processes each transcript to extract memories
- Content hashes track changes to prevent duplicate processing
- This enables automatic memory extraction from Claude Code sessions
