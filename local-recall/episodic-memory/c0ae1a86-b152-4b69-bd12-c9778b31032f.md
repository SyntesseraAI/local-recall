# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS with the following structure:

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Slashes (`/`) are replaced with `d` (e.g., `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `UsersdjoedjCodedjSyntesserajlocal-recall`)
- Each transcript is stored as a JSONL file with ISO timestamp (e.g., `2025-12-01T001234.567Z.jsonl`)

## File Structure

Each transcript JSONL file contains session events where user messages are stored in `$message` field.

## Usage

This information is crucial for the transcript-collector component which needs to:
1. Locate the correct project directory based on working directory
2. Discover transcript files via directory traversal
3. Parse JSONL format to extract user messages
