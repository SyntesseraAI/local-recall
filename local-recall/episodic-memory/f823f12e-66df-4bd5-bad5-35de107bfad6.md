Hooks are designed to inject relevant memories into user prompts before Claude processes them. SessionStart injects recent memories at session start, UserPromptSubmit injects semantically similar memories for each prompt. The empty stdout issue directly breaks this core functionality—users won't see memory suggestions in their prompts.
