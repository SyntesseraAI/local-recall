The vector store implementation uses better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings are generated using fastembed with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). The model is cached in local_cache/ after first download. First startup may take 30-60 seconds for initial model download, subsequent runs load from cache.
