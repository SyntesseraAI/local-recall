# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS (and likely Windows at `%APPDATA%\Claude\projects\`).

## Directory Naming

The project folder name is the absolute working directory path with:
- All slashes (`/`) replaced with underscores (`_`)
- Leading underscore removed (e.g., `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`)

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files within each project directory. Each line is a JSON object representing a single event in the session.

## Relevance to Local Recall

This is important for the MCP server's background daemon which syncs transcripts from Claude's cache to extract memories automatically every 5 minutes.
