Local Recall is a project that creates a persistent memory layer enabling multiple AI agents to store and retrieve contextual information about codebases across sessions. All memories are stored locally as structured markdown files within the repository, making them version-controllable and shareable. It integrates with Claude Code through hooks and supports MCP server for memory tools.
