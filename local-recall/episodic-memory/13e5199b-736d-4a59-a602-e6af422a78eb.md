# Memory Extraction from Transcripts

The MCP server has a background daemon that:

## Process
1. Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
2. Processes JSONL transcript files to extract memories
3. Uses `claude -p` to extract keywords/memories from transcript content
4. Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
5. Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
6. Runs periodically (every 5 minutes)

## Key Details
- Transcripts are stored as JSONL (one JSON event per line)
- Each transcript file has a filename like `transcript_<session-id>.jsonl`
- The collector needs to handle both full transcript processing and incremental updates
- Session IDs are UUIDs in the format like `01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`
