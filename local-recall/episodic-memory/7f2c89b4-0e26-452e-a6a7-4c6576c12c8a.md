The vector store uses `better-sqlite3` with the `sqlite-vec` extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings are generated using `fastembed` with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). Search results use cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0), rounded to 2 decimal places. When scores are equal, more recent memories (by `occurred_at`) are ranked first as a tie-breaker. The database file `memory.sqlite` is gitignored and auto-generated.
