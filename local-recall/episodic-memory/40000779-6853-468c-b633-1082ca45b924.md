Significant architectural refactoring in commit 91d7734: 114 files changed (+3,120 / -1,843 lines). Replaced SQLite + sqlite-vec with Orama vector search. Removed daemon architecture. Added 11 episodic memories and ~70 thinking memories. Simplified hooks to work directly without HTTP communication.
