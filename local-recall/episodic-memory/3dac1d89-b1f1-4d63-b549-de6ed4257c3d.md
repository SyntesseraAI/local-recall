When extracting memories from transcripts, prioritize:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

Exclude generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious/trivial info, and sensitive data.
