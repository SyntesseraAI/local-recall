Search results use cosine distance similarity score (0.0 to 1.0). Scores are rounded to 2 decimal places. Results sorted by score descending. When scores are equal, more recent memories (by `occurred_at` timestamp) are ranked first as a tie-breaker. This ensures both relevance and recency in search results.
