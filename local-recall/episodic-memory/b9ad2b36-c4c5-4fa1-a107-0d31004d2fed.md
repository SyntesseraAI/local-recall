# Transcript Condensing Benefits

The transcript condensing feature (implemented in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`) provides substantial benefits:

## Size Reduction
- Original transcript: ~256 KB
- Condensed transcript: ~48 KB
- **Reduction: ~81% smaller**

## Why This Matters

1. **Memory Extraction**: Passing condensed transcripts to Claude Haiku for memory extraction is more efficient
2. **Storage**: Significantly reduces disk space used in `local-recall/` directory
3. **Processing**: Faster processing in the MCP server daemon
4. **Context**: Smaller payloads mean better use of token budgets

## Condensing Process

The condensing removes unnecessary details while preserving:
- Tool invocations and results
- User requests and assistant responses
- Important outcomes and decisions
- Sequence and context

This is particularly valuable for the background daemon which processes many transcripts over time.
