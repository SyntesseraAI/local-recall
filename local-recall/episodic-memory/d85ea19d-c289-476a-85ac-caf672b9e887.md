The project requires:
- Unit tests in tests/unit/ for all new features
- Integration tests in tests/integration/
- Documentation in docs/ folder
- Update existing docs when modifying functionality
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases

This is a mandatory standard for contributions to the codebase.
