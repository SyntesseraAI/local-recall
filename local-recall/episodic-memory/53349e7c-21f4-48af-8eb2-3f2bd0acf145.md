The `MemoryManager` class creates the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory but previously did not ensure the `.gitignore` file exists in the parent `local-recall/` directory. This caused the `.gitignore` file to be created if missing when memories are written. The fix ensures `.gitignore` is created in the `local-recall/` directory during MemoryManager initialization to prevent accidental commits of generated files like `index.json` and `recall.log`.
