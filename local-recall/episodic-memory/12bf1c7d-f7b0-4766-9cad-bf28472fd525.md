Memory extraction logic relies on well-structured system prompts stored in separate prompt files. These prompts guide Claude in analyzing transcripts and extracting valuable memories according to specific criteria (what was learned, problems solved, codebase-specific patterns). This separation of concerns makes it easy to refine extraction quality without modifying the core extractor logic.
