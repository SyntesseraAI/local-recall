The MCP server includes a background daemon that:
1. Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
2. Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
3. Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
4. Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
5. Runs every 5 minutes

This is why the Stop hook is disabled - memory extraction happens asynchronously via the daemon.
