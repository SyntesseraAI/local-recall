When analyzing transcripts for memories, the system should:
- Save ALL thinking content (even single-line), without any prefix modification
- Save ONLY multiline answers (content with 2+ lines)
- Use `generateSubject()` to extract the first line for multi-line text, or first sentence for single-line text

This creates an asymmetric memory pattern: all internal reasoning is captured, but only more substantial responses are saved as separate memories.
