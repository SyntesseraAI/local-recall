The prompt used to instruct Claude on memory extraction has been externalized into a separate file at `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This separation allows for easier maintenance and iteration on the extraction logic without modifying the core memory-extractor code. The prompt defines how Claude should analyze transcripts and identify valuable memories based on specific criteria.
