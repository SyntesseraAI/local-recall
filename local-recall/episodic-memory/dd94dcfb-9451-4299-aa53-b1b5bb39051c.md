The MemoryManager class creates the local-recall/memories/ directory but must also ensure the .gitignore file exists in the parent local-recall/ directory. Without calling ensureGitignore() during initialization, the .gitignore won't be created. This is critical because the .gitignore must be version-controlled to exclude generated index files (orama-*-index.json) and logs (recall.log).
