# Memory Extraction Guidelines

When extracting memories from transcripts:

## What to Extract
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

## What NOT to Extract
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Memory Quality Requirements
- **Be specific**: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- **Be concise**: One concept per memory
- **Be actionable**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently
- **Use appropriate scope**: `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`
