The local-recall project root IS the plugin root. Hooks in hooks.json use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} to reference scripts relative to the plugin installation directory. Hooks receive cwd via stdin to operate on the user's project directory. Scripts are bundled in scripts/ directory (gitignored build output).
