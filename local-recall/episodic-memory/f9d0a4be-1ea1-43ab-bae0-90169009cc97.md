Local Recall uses a plugin architecture with skills stored in `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/skills/`. Version bumps follow semantic versioning (currently at 0.1.3). Plugin metadata includes tool descriptions for better discoverability in Claude Code marketplace. New skills should be added with corresponding metadata updates.
