The MCP server (PID 4524) is currently running from:
- Location: `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/mcp-server/server.js`
- Config: `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.mcp.json`

This is a plugin subdirectory structure, not the main project root. The main project root doesn't have a compiled `scripts/` directory yet.
