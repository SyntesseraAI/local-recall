The Stop hook is disabled and memory extraction happens via the MCP server's background daemon instead. The daemon:
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache
- Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
- Runs every 5 minutes

This is documented in the CLAUDE.md file under 'Background Daemon' section.
