# Memory Keywords and Searchability

## Importance

Keywords are the primary mechanism for discovering relevant memories. They are used by:
- **UserPromptSubmit Hook**: Extracts keywords from user prompts to find relevant memories
- **Search Functions**: Fuzzy matching against memory keywords
- **SessionStart Hook**: May use keywords for context injection

## Guidelines for Keywords

### What Makes Good Keywords

- **Specific**: Use concrete terms that uniquely identify the memory
  - Good: `mcp-server`, `transcript-collection`, `memory-extraction`
  - Bad: `code`, `project`, `feature`

- **Searchable**: Think about what keywords someone would search for
  - Include technical terms, component names, file paths
  - Include problem names if documenting a solution

- **Consistent**: Use standard terminology across the project
  - All memory extraction related keywords should include `memory-extraction` or similar

### Quantity

- Aim for 3-10 keywords per memory
- More specific memories: 3-5 keywords
- Complex topics: 7-10 keywords
- Avoid keyword bloat - each should be meaningful

### Examples by Memory Type

**Bug Fix Memory**
- Keywords: bug name, component affected, error message terms, solution keywords

**Architectural Decision**
- Keywords: pattern name, components involved, decision rationale terms

**Configuration Quirk**
- Keywords: tool/library name, config option names, context where it applies

## Implementation in Search

The fuzzy search implementation in `src/core/search.ts` uses these keywords to match user queries against memory subjects and keywords, with a configurable threshold (default 0.6).
