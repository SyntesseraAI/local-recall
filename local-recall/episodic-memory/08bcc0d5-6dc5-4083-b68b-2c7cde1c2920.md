Memory scope determines how memories are accessed and applied. Use `global` for architectural decisions, conventions, and patterns that apply across the entire codebase. Use `file:<path>` for details specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`). Use `area:<name>` for concerns related to a component or feature area (e.g., `area:authentication`). Proper scope selection improves memory retrieval effectiveness and helps future assistants find relevant information quickly.
