# Coding Preferences

Based on the CLAUDE.md guidelines in the project:

## Key Principles

1. **Avoid over-engineering**: Only make changes directly requested or clearly necessary
2. **Keep solutions simple and focused**: Don't add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked
3. **No unnecessary additions**:
   - Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to unchanged code
   - Only add comments where logic isn't self-evident
   - Don't add error handling for scenarios that can't happen
   - Don't create helpers/utilities for one-time operations
4. **No backwards-compatibility hacks**: Delete unused code completely rather than leaving stubs
5. **Trust internal code**: Trust framework guarantees; only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)

## Implication

When working on this codebase, keep PRs minimal and focused. Avoid scope creep or "while we're here" refactors.
