The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude's API with streaming to process transcripts and extract memories. Key implementation details:

- Uses `claude-sdk` with `stream: true` for streaming responses
- Processes transcripts through a structured extraction pipeline
- Generates embeddings for semantic search capabilities
- Returns extracted memories with metadata (id, subject, keywords, scope, content_hash)
- Handles streaming responses to avoid loading entire responses in memory
