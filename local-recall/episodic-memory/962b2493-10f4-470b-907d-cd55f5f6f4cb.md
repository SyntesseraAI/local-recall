Local Recall uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search:
- Model is automatically downloaded on first use (~30-60 seconds initial download time)
- Cached in `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` for subsequent runs
- If corrupted (interrupted download), remove directory and model will re-download automatically
- Vector store uses SQLite with sqlite-vec extension for cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0, rounded to 2 decimal places)
- Recency tie-breaker: equal scores sort by occurred_at timestamp (recent first)
