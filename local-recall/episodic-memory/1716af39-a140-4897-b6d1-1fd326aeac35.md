# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line). Each line represents a single event in the session.

## Relevance

This is critical for the transcript-collector module which needs to locate and process transcripts for memory extraction. The path transformation logic must match Claude's internal path-to-folder-name conversion.
