Local Recall stores memories as markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. Each memory file contains YAML frontmatter with metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash) followed by markdown content. Memory files are version-controlled in git, while `memory.sqlite` and `recall.log` are gitignored.
