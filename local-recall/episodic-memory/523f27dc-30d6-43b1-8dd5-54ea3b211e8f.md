The memory extraction system prompt instructs Claude to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories by identifying: what was learned, important facts about the codebase, specific patterns/configurations, and problems solved. The prompt emphasizes being specific with file paths and function names, being concise (one concept per memory), and being actionable. It also guides scope selection (global vs file vs area) and what to extract vs what to avoid (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data).
