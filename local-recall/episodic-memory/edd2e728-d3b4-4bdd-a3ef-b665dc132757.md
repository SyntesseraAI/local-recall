The MemoryExtractor class in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` is responsible for:
- Parsing session transcripts into memory-worthy events
- Using Claude Haiku to generate memories from transcript content
- Handling structured output with proper frontmatter metadata
- Managing memory creation and deduplication via content hashing

This component bridges the gap between raw transcripts and the structured memory storage system.
