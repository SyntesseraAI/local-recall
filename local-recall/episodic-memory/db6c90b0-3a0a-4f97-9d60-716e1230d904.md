Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. Core architecture includes:

- **Memory Storage**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
- **Vector Store**: SQLite-backed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 embeddings for semantic search
- **Claude Code Integration**: Hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit) and MCP server
- **Memory Format**: Each file has id, subject, keywords, applies_to (scope), occurred_at, and content_hash
- **Key Components**: MemoryManager, VectorStore, SearchEngine, TranscriptCollector, MemoryExtractor
- **Scopes**: Memories can be global, file-specific, or area-specific

The system enables AI agents to share knowledge across sessions through version-controlled markdown files.
