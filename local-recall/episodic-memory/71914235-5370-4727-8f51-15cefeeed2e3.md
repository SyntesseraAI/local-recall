The memory extraction process analyzes both user prompts and assistant responses from transcripts to extract relevant keywords and create comprehensive memories. This bidirectional analysis helps capture:
- What the user was asking for or requesting
- What Claude explained, discovered, or recommended
- Context from both perspectives for more complete memory records

This ensures memories capture the full session context rather than just isolated facts.
