# Memory Extraction Process

## Core Concept

Memory extraction analyzes session transcripts to identify valuable information that future AI assistants should know about the codebase.

## What Gets Extracted

### DO Extract:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during the session
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations
- Newly discovered functionality or APIs

### DO NOT Extract:
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that would become outdated quickly

## Memory Attributes

Each extracted memory has:
- `subject` - Brief one-line description (max 200 chars)
- `keywords` - Array of 1-10 searchable keywords (lowercase, specific)
- `applies_to` - Scope: `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`
- `occurred_at` - ISO-8601 timestamp of when it was learned
- `content` - Detailed markdown content
- `content_hash` - SHA-256 hash prefix for deduplication

## Deduplication

Memories are checked for duplicates using:
1. `occurred_at` timestamp - Memories from the same event
2. `content_hash` - SHA-256 hash of content - Memories with identical content

If a duplicate is found, the existing memory is returned instead of creating a new one.
