Claude Code hooks are shell commands configured in `.claude/settings.json`. Two active hooks:

1. **SessionStart**: Loads all memories, returns 5 most recent (by occurred_at)
2. **UserPromptSubmit**: Initializes vector store (lazy, cached), performs semantic search on prompt

Both hooks receive JSON via stdin with: session_id, transcript_path, cwd, and (for UserPromptSubmit) the prompt.

The Stop hook is disabled - memory extraction is handled by MCP server daemon running every 5 minutes.
