On session startup, the system performs a **full reload** of all memories rather than a delta/incremental load. Each session creates a fresh `MemoryManager` instance and loads all memories from disk via `listMemories()`. The 5 most recent memories (sorted by `occurred_at` descending) are selected and injected into the session context.

This is a full reload approach, not incremental - all memory files are read from disk on each session start.
