The Stop hook is currently disabled. Instead, memory extraction is handled by the MCP server daemon which:
- Processes transcripts asynchronously (runs every 5 minutes)
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
- Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change

This async approach avoids blocking session termination.
