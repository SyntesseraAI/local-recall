Transcripts are condensed before being passed to Claude for memory extraction. This process reduces the number of tokens needed for analysis while preserving the essential information about what occurred in the session. The condensed format uses simple notation:

- `[User]` - user requests/questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses
- `[Tool: Name]` - tool invocations
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - outcomes

This condensed format is more efficient for LLM processing than full transcripts.
