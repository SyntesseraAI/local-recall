The memory extraction system uses a structured prompt approach with separate system and user prompts:

- System prompt: Defines Claude's role, memory format requirements, extraction guidelines, and scope rules
- User prompt: Provides the actual transcript to analyze and extraction instructions
- Prompt is designed to extract memories as JSON with required fields: subject, keywords, applies_to, content
- Guidelines include extracting architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configurations, and relationships
- Explicitly excludes generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and sensitive data

This separation allows for reusable prompt patterns and cleaner prompt management.
