# JSONL Transcript Format

Claude's transcript files use JSON Lines (`.jsonl`) format, where each line is a separate JSON object.

## Parsing Requirements

When reading transcript files:
1. Read the file line-by-line (not as a single JSON object)
2. Parse each line as a separate JSON object
3. Each line represents a single event/message in the transcript
4. Do NOT try to parse the entire file as one JSON object - this will fail

## Implementation Pattern

Use Node.js readline or similar to process line-by-line:
- Open file stream
- Read line by line using readline interface or similar
- Parse each line with JSON.parse()
- Handle errors gracefully for malformed lines
- Process each event as it's parsed

This is critical for the transcript collector to properly parse Claude's transcript files.
