The user prefers pragmatic, simple code that directly solves the problem at hand. They favor:
- Avoiding over-engineering and unnecessary abstractions
- Keeping code focused on immediate requirements
- Not creating helpers or utilities for one-time operations
- Not designing for hypothetical future requirements
- Trusting existing framework guarantees
- Only adding validation at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)

This aligns with the principle that the right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task.
