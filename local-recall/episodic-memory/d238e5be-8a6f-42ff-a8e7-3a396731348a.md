The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API (via `@anthropic-ai/sdk`) with streaming enabled to analyze transcripts and extract memories. The `extractMemories()` function calls the Claude API with a configured model and processes the response stream to parse memory objects from the transcript content.
