The MCP server includes a background daemon that syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, processes them to extract memories, and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection. The daemon runs every 5 minutes and deletes/recreates memories when transcripts change. This replaced the disabled Stop hook for asynchronous memory extraction.
