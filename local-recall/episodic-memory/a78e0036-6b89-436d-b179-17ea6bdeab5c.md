The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku with streaming to process transcripts efficiently. The `extractMemories` function accepts a transcript string and uses the Claude API with `stream: true` to progressively parse and extract memories. This approach allows for real-time processing of large transcripts without waiting for the complete response, improving responsiveness of the memory extraction pipeline.
