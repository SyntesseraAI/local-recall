The vector store (src/core/vector-store.ts) uses better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings are generated using fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). Search results use cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0-1.0), rounded to 2 decimal places, with recency tie-breaker using occurred_at timestamp.
