The transcript collector uses `isSyntheticFile(transcript.sourcePath)` to determine if a transcript should be skipped during the sync process. This check is applied before copying transcripts from Claude's cache to avoid processing synthetic files that are generated by Claude Code for internal purposes and don't contain user interactions.
