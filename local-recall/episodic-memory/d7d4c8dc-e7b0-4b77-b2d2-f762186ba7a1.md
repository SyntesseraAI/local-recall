Each memory is stored as a markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing: id (UUID), subject (brief description), keywords (array for search), applies_to (scope: global/file:/path/to/file/area:component-name), occurred_at (ISO-8601 timestamp), and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix for deduplication). Memory files ARE version-controlled and committed to git, unlike the SQLite database which is gitignored.
