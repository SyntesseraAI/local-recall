Each memory is stored as a markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing: `id` (UUID), `subject` (brief description), `keywords` (array for searching), `applies_to` (scope: global/file:/path/area:name), `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp for deduplication), and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix for deduplication). Memory files are version-controlled in git under `local-recall/episodic-memory/`.
