The memory extraction system uses a transcript condensing step before sending to Claude for analysis. This is part of a broader workflow:
1. Session transcripts are condensed into events format ([User], [Assistant], [Tool], [Result])
2. Condensed transcript is sent to Claude Haiku via the extraction prompt
3. Claude analyzes and returns memories as JSON
4. Memories are persisted using the memory module

This condensing approach reduces token consumption while preserving essential information about what was learned, implemented, and debugged during the session.
