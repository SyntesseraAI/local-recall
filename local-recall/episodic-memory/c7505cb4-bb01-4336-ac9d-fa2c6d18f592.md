When condensing transcripts into events for memory extraction, the transcript collector should filter out or ignore any messages prefixed with `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]`. These are internal system prompts used by the memory extraction system itself and should not be included in the condensed transcript that gets analyzed for memory creation. This prevents the extraction system from creating memories about its own operation.
