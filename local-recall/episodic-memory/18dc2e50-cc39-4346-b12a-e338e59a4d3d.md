The MCP server (src/mcp-server/server.ts) runs a background daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes. This daemon handles memory extraction and is controlled by configuration flags like `episodicEnabled`. The daemon is distinct from the hooks which run synchronously during Claude sessions.
