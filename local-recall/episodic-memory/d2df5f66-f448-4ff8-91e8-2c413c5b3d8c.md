# Memory Extraction Implementation

## Claude API Requirement

Memory extraction cannot be fully automated with simple parsing. Claude's semantic understanding is required to:
- Identify key learnings from transcript events
- Extract actionable insights
- Understand context and relationships
- Determine appropriate scope (global vs file vs area)

## Extraction Flow

1. **Input**: Transcript (JSON array of events)
2. **Processing**: Send transcript to Claude API with memory extraction prompt
3. **Output**: Structured JSON with extracted memories
4. **Storage**: Write memories to markdown files in episodic-memory/

## Deduplication

Use the same deduplication strategy as memories:
- Calculate content hash of extracted memories
- Compare against existing memories by occurred_at + content_hash
- Only create new memories if they don't already exist

This prevents duplicate memories across multiple extraction runs.
