# User Prompts as Memory Sources

User-submitted prompts (from UserPromptSubmit hook) can be valuable sources for extracting and creating memories.

## Context for Memory Extraction

When processing user prompts:
1. User prompts contain the exact intent and context for the session
2. Keywords extracted from prompts help search relevant historical memories
3. User prompts paired with Claude's responses can create useful context memories
4. The UserPromptSubmit hook receives the raw prompt before Claude processes it

## Current Implementation

The UserPromptSubmit hook currently searches existing memories based on extracted keywords, but doesn't create new memories from prompts. The MCP server daemon handles transcript-based memory creation asynchronously.

## Potential Enhancement

User prompts could be indexed or used to create context memories about:
- Common task types the user performs
- Recurring problems or questions
- Project-specific conventions or preferences
- Important context the user frequently provides
