# Embedding Model Caching

Local Recall uses FastEmbed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded on first use.

## Cache Location

The model is cached in `local_cache/` directory at the project root:
- `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` - Main model directory
- `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json` - Tokenizer file

## First Run Performance

Initial startup may take 30-60 seconds while downloading the ~133MB model. This is normal and only happens once.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter "Tokenizer file not found" errors:
1. The cache may be corrupted or incomplete (usually from interrupted downloads)
2. Solution: Delete `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*`
3. The model will automatically re-download on next run

This directory should be gitignored as it contains downloaded model files.
