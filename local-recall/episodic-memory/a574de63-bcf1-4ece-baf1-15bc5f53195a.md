The migration module includes logic to handle upgrades from older storage formats. When migrating to the new padded JSONL format, the system should detect and clean up legacy files like the bare `thinking.jsonl`.

Users encountering both `thinking.jsonl` and `thinking-000001.jsonl` files should run the migration to consolidate storage to the new format. This ensures consistent file organization going forward.
