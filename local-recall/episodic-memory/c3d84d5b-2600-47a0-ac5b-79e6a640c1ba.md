Local Recall uses the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) from the fastembed library:

- **First run**: Automatically downloads to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` (30-60 seconds)
- **Subsequent runs**: Loads from cache instantly
- **Cache location**: `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`
- **Common issue**: Corrupted cache due to interrupted downloads causes tokenizer.json missing errors
- **Fix**: Remove `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and restart to re-download

This is expected behavior and only occurs on the initial setup.
