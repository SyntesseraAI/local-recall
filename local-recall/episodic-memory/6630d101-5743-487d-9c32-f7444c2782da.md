Key principles for extracting memories from transcripts:

**DO Extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT Extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

**Scope Guidelines:**
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area
