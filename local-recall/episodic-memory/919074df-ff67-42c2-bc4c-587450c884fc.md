# Memory Extraction Guidelines

## What to Extract

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Specificity Requirements

Memories should include:
- File paths and function names
- Concrete implementation details
- Actionable insights for future assistants
- Appropriate scope classification (global, file:path, area:name)
