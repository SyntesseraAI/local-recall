The memory extraction process uses `claude -p` (Claude prompt command) to analyze JSONL transcript files and extract valuable memories. This leverages Claude's ability to understand context and identify actionable information. The extraction is invoked by the MCP server daemon rather than the Stop hook to avoid blocking user workflows.
