# Model Selection Preference

Based on the project context and user interactions:
- Use **Claude Sonnet** for complex analysis, planning, and implementation tasks
- Use **Claude Haiku** for quick keyword extraction, simple searches, and lightweight operations

The current environment shows Haiku 4.5 as the available model, but this preference indicates the user optimizes based on task complexity and cost when multiple models are available.

This is relevant for the MCP server and transcript processing which use Claude to extract keywords and analyze content - simpler keyword extraction might use Haiku while complex memory analysis uses Sonnet.
