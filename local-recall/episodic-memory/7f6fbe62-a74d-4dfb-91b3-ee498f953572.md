The MCP server includes a background daemon that syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, processes them to extract memories, tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection, deletes/recreates memories when transcripts change, and runs every 5 minutes. This eliminates the need for the Stop hook to be active on every session.
