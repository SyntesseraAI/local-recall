The memory extractor was successfully switched from using the default Claude model to Haiku for structured memory extraction tasks. Testing confirmed that Haiku correctly extracts memories with valid YAML frontmatter and markdown content structure. This change provides approximately 20x cost reduction and faster processing while maintaining full compatibility with the existing memory extraction pipeline. The `callClaudeCLI` method at line 80-81 uses `--model haiku` to invoke Haiku explicitly.
