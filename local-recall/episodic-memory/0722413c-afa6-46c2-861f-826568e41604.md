# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON event per line):
- Named by session start time: `2025-12-01T14-30-45.jsonl`
- Each line contains an event object with type, timestamp, and payload
- Events include: `session_start`, `user_message`, `assistant_message`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `session_end`
