# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Structure

Project folders use the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → folder named `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts stored as JSONL files in that folder
- Each transcript contains events with timestamps and tool results

## Usage in Local Recall

The `transcript-collector.ts` module reads from this location to:
1. Identify project-specific transcripts
2. Extract memories from transcript content
3. Sync with MCP server daemon for background processing

This is critical for the memory extraction pipeline to function correctly.
