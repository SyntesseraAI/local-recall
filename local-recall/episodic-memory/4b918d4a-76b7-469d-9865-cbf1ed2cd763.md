When extracting memories from transcripts:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations and optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly
