The MCP server (server.js) must be compiled with all dependencies bundled into a single file since the plugin environment doesn't include node_modules. The build script should NOT use esbuild's `--external` flag for the MCP server build. The compiled server.js should be ~1.1MB when properly bundled with all dependencies.
