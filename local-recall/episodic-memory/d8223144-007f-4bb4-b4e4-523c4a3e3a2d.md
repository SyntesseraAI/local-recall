Each memory is stored as a markdown file in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. Files are named using UUID identifiers and contain YAML frontmatter with metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash) followed by the memory content in markdown format. These files are version-controlled in git.
