The transcript collector implements multiple fallback strategies when the standard path doesn't work:

1. **Primary**: Use the expected path with sanitized project name
2. **Fallback 1**: Scan all directories in ~/.claude/projects/ and check for projects matching the cwd
3. **Fallback 2**: Look for directories ending with specific patterns to match the project

This defensive approach ensures transcripts are found even if Claude's naming scheme changes or in unusual project structures. All fallback attempts are now logged at INFO level for visibility.
