Memories are scoped to one of three categories:

1. `global` - Applies to the entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
2. `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
3. `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

This scoping helps future assistants understand where each memory is relevant and organize them appropriately.
