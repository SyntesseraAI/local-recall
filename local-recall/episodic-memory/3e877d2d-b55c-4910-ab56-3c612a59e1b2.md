Memory extraction uses a dedicated prompt defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This prompt includes comprehensive guidelines for what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, conventions) and what to exclude (generic knowledge, temporary steps, obvious info, sensitive data). The prompt emphasizes scope-specific extraction with appropriate applies_to values.
