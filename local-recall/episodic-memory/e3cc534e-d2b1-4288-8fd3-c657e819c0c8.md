# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Structure

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path to the project:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`
- Slashes are replaced with underscores
- The folder name directly reflects the project's absolute path

## Transcript Files

Each session creates a JSONL (JSON Lines) file:
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/<session-id>.jsonl`
- Format: One JSON object per line
- Each line contains a transcript event

## Important Notes

- The absolute path mapping is consistent and predictable
- Transcripts are stored in JSONL format, not plain JSON
- Understanding this structure is critical for:
  - MCP servers that process transcripts asynchronously
  - Memory extraction systems that need to sync with Claude's transcript cache
  - Hook scripts that need to locate the current session's transcript
