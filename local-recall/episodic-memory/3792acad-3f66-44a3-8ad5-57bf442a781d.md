The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API with streaming to process transcripts and extract memories. It employs a prompt-based approach defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that instructs Claude on how to identify and structure valuable memories from session transcripts. The streaming implementation allows for efficient processing of large transcripts.
