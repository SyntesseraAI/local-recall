The local-recall project uses TypeScript with strict type checking enabled. The build process compiles TypeScript and the project includes comprehensive unit and integration tests. Tests verify core functionality including memory creation, searching, and extraction. The project structure separates source files (src/) from compiled output, with proper tsconfig.json configuration.
