Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows Claude Code and other AI tools to store and retrieve contextual information across sessions. All memories are stored locally in markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. The project includes:

- **Claude Code hooks** (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop) in `src/hooks/`
- **MCP server** for exposing memory tools
- **Memory format**: Markdown files with metadata fields like `id`, `subject`, `keywords`, `applies_to`, `occurred_at`, `content_hash`
- **Core components**: Memory manager, Index manager, Search (fuzzy), and utilities

Memories are version-controlled and committed to git.
