When fixing issues with the deployed plugin, bump the version number in both `package.json` and `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to trigger a fresh deployment. This avoids stale cached versions affecting other Claude instances. The old cached version remains but the new version deploys to a new cache directory, effectively sidelining the old broken version.
