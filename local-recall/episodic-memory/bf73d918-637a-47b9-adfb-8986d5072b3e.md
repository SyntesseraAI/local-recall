The prompt template for memory extraction is stored separately in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This centralized location makes it easy to refine the extraction instructions without modifying the extraction logic itself. The prompt should guide Claude to extract specific, actionable memories based on the guidelines in CLAUDE.md.
