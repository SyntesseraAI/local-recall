# MCP Server Background Daemon

The MCP server runs a background daemon that:
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
- Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
- Runs every 5 minutes

This eliminates the need for the Stop hook (which is currently disabled) and provides a more reliable mechanism for memory creation from session activity.

The daemon relies on the transcript collector to correctly identify and locate transcript files based on the user's working directory.
