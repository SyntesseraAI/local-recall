# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full transcript path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) containing conversation events:
- Each line is a valid JSON object representing one event
- Events include User messages, Assistant responses, and Tool invocations
- File naming follows the pattern: `<timestamp>.jsonl`

This location is used by the MCP server's transcript collector to sync transcripts for memory extraction.
