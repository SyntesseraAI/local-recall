The memory extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` provides specific guidelines to Claude for analyzing session transcripts and extracting valuable memories. The prompt:

- Explains what constitutes a valuable memory vs. generic knowledge
- Provides guidelines for scope selection (global, file:path, area:name)
- Defines memory structure and required fields
- Instructs Claude to output only valid JSON with no additional formatting
- Includes examples of what to extract and what to exclude

This prompt is critical for ensuring consistent, high-quality memory extraction across sessions.
