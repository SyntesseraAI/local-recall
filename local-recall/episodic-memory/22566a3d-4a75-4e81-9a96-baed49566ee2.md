Each memory is stored as a structured markdown file in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` with YAML frontmatter containing: id (UUID), subject, keywords (array), applies_to (global/file/area), occurred_at (ISO-8601), and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix). Memory files ARE version-controlled and will be committed to git, while the SQLite database is gitignored.
