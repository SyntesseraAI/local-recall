The MemoryExtractor class processes transcripts through Claude to extract valuable memories. It takes a transcript and uses Claude Haiku to:

1. Extract keywords from the transcript content
2. Generate memory content with subject, keywords, and detailed information
3. Format the output into structured memory objects
4. Handle the conversion of raw transcript data into memory-ready format

The extraction process is designed to be efficient and the extracted memories follow the standard memory file format with YAML frontmatter.
