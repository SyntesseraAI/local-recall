Local Recall uses the fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use. First run may take 30-60 seconds while downloading; subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file error occurs, delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to force re-download.
