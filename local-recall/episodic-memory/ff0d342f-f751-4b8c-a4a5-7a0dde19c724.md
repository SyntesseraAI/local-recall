The test suite was extended with new test cases for field name normalization. Added tests that verify the memory extractor correctly handles:

- Alternative field names (title, tags, scope, body, description, memory)
- Mixed case field name variations
- Memories with different field name combinations

All 228 tests (220 existing + 8 new) pass successfully. The test additions ensure the field normalization feature works correctly and prevents regressions.
