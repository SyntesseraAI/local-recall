The transcript synchronization process has a two-phase approach: First, `cleanupTranscripts()` removes any existing synthetic files from the local `local-recall/transcripts/` folder. Then, the sync process copies new/modified transcripts from Claude's cache. This ordering ensures that previously copied synthetic files are cleaned up before new ones arrive, but filtering at copy-time prevents unnecessary copies in the first place.
