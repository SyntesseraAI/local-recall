The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to process transcripts and extract memories. It communicates through MCP (Model Context Protocol) to invoke the language model. The extraction process takes a transcript and uses prompts defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to generate structured memories.

Key implementation details:
- Uses MCP client to communicate with Claude models
- Processes transcripts to identify valuable memories
- Returns structured memory objects with metadata
- Part of the background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously
