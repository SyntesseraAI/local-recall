When developing Local Recall:
- All new features must have unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests go in `tests/integration/`
- Documentation must be in `docs/` folder
- Update existing docs when modifying functionality
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases
- Use provided tools rather than direct file manipulation
- New memories need relevant, specific keywords
- Consider scope carefully: global vs file: vs area:
