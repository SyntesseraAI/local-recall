According to CLAUDE.md, the Stop hook is currently disabled. Memory extraction happens asynchronously via an MCP server daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes, not synchronously at the end of a session. This design allows the system to extract memories without blocking session termination and enables proper error handling and retry logic.
