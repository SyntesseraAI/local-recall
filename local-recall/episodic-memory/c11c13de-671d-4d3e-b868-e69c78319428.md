Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/<project-hash>/transcripts/` where the project hash is derived from the project's file path. The transcript collector uses multiple strategies to find these:

1. Primary: Direct path calculation using the project path
2. Fallback: Scan all directories in ~/.claude/projects and check each for transcript-like content
3. Last resort: Check for directories ending with specific path patterns

This hierarchical approach helps locate transcripts even when the exact path calculation may not match Claude's actual hashing algorithm.
