# Fuzzy Search Threshold Behavior

The fuzzy search implementation in `src/core/search.ts` uses a configurable threshold for matching keywords and subjects against memories.

## Current Behavior

A threshold of 0.6 (or 60%) is used to filter results. This means:
- Higher thresholds are more selective (fewer false positives)
- Lower thresholds are more inclusive (catch more variations)

## Performance Implications

When searching with fuzzy matching:
- Scores are calculated using fuzzy distance algorithms
- Results below the threshold are filtered out
- The threshold balances precision vs. recall

## Considerations

For memory extraction and searching:
- Keywords should be specific to improve matching accuracy
- Consider that typos and variations will be caught by fuzzy matching
- The threshold value is configurable via environment or config file (default 0.6)
