Vector store implemented in `src/core/vector-store.ts` uses better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings generated using fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB, downloaded to local_cache/ on first use). Store syncs with file-based memories, handling add/remove operations. Search returns memories ranked by similarity score.
