Memories use three scope types for targeting applicability:
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component area (e.g., `area:authentication`)

This scope system allows memories to be retrieved contextually based on what the AI assistant is currently working on.
