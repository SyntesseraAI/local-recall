Added comprehensive test cases to verify field name normalization works correctly:

- Test for alternative field names (`title`, `summary`, `description`, `scope`, `tags`)
- Test for mixed field usage in same batch
- Test for missing required fields after normalization (validation still fails as expected)
- Test for different wrapper formats combined with field normalization

All 228 tests pass including these new normalization tests, confirming the fix handles Claude's field name variations properly.
