The MCP server is currently running from `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/mcp-server/server.js` with config at `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.mcp.json`.

This indicates:
- The main project root doesn't have a `scripts/` directory yet
- The plugin subdirectory contains a separate build/distribution
- `npm run build` in the root may not be building the hooks/MCP server yet

When checking MCP server status, verify both the root and `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/` locations.
