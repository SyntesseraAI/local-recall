# Memory ID Format

Memory files use UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) for the `id` field in the YAML frontmatter.

## Implementation Details

- Each memory file must have a unique UUID in the `id` field
- This ensures memories can be reliably identified and referenced
- UUIDs are generated using standard libraries (e.g., Node.js `crypto.randomUUID()` or npm packages like `uuid`)
- Memory deduplication uses `occurred_at` timestamp and `content_hash` rather than ID
