The SessionStart hook loads all memories from disk via MemoryManager.listMemories() and returns the 5 most recent memories sorted by occurred_at field. It does NOT initialize the vector store to avoid slow initialization on every session start. Vector store initialization is lazy - it happens on first UserPromptSubmit hook invocation and is cached for subsequent use.
