# Embedding-Based Semantic Search

Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for generating embeddings and performing semantic search.

## Current Setup

- Model: BGE-small-en-v1.5 (~133MB)
- Cache location: `local_cache/` (auto-downloaded on first run)
- First startup: 30-60 seconds for model download
- Subsequent runs: Load from cache

## Files Involved

- `src/core/embedding.ts` - Generates embeddings from memory content
- `src/core/vector-store.ts` - Stores and searches embeddings
- Integration with search pipeline for semantic matching

## Advantages Over Fuzzy Matching

- Understands semantic meaning, not just keyword matches
- Better for natural language queries
- Can find related concepts even with different terminology
- More aligned with how humans search for information
