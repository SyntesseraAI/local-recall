The local-recall plugin defines hooks in `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/config/hooks.json`. The hook configuration includes SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks which are working in VS Code extension, but the Stop hook is missing or not supported.

VS Code extension hook support appears to be more limited than the Claude Code CLI tool, affecting the memory creation pipeline.
