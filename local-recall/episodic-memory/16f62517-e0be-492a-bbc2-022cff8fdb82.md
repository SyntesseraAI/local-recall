Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system that enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions. All memories are stored locally within the repository as version-controllable markdown files with YAML frontmatter metadata. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings for semantic search, allowing multiple AI agents to share knowledge across different coding sessions.
