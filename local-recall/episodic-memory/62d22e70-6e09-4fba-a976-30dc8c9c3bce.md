The git status output indicates hundreds of memory files have been deleted from local-recall/episodic-memory/ and local-recall/thinking-memory/ directories. This appears to be part of a migration or cleanup process mentioned in recent commits ("feat: Migrate memory storage to JSONL format"). These deletions should be committed as part of the restructuring work rather than being kept as uncommitted changes.
