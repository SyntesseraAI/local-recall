# Transcript JSONL Format

Claude Code transcripts use JSON Lines (.jsonl) format for efficient streaming and parsing.

## Structure

Each line in a transcript file is a complete, valid JSON object representing a single turn or event in the conversation.

## Parsing Implications

- Files can be parsed line-by-line without loading the entire file into memory
- Each line must be parsed independently as valid JSON
- No array wrapper or comma separation between objects
- This format is ideal for large conversations that would be memory-intensive as a single JSON array

## Usage in transcript-collector

The transcript-collector should:
1. Read the transcript file line by line
2. Parse each line as individual JSON
3. Accumulate parsed objects to reconstruct the full conversation history

This is more efficient than attempting to parse the entire file as a JSON array.
