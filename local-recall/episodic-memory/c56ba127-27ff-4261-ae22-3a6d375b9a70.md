The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model via `claude -p` command to process transcripts and extract memories. It uses a system prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that instructs Claude to extract valuable memories in JSON format with fields: subject, keywords, applies_to, and content. The extractor runs transcript condensing before memory extraction to reduce token usage.
