The memory extraction prompt in `memory-extraction.ts` provides Claude with detailed guidelines for analyzing transcripts:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions with reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Project-specific code patterns and conventions
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Component relationships and dependencies
- Performance considerations and optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

This structured approach ensures high-quality memory extraction focused on long-term value for future sessions.
