The user requested removal of trigger-pattern-based memory filtering. The implementation was simplified to save ALL messages from transcripts without any filtering:

- **Removed**: `USER_TRIGGER_PATTERNS` regex ("remember this", "save this", "don't forget", etc.)
- **Removed**: `AUTO_DETECT_PATTERNS` heuristics (architecture patterns, bugfix patterns, discovery patterns, convention patterns)
- **Changed**: `analyzeForMemories()` function now iterates through all messages and saves each one with role prefix (`**user**:` or `**assistant**:`)
- **Behavior**: Skips only empty messages, captures entire conversation without selective filtering

This represents a significant shift from a curated/selective memory approach to a comprehensive transcript capture approach.
