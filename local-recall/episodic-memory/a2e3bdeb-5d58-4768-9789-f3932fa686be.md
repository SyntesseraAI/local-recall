# Transcript Condensing

Transcripts are condensed into key events to reduce verbosity and token usage:

## Condensed Event Format

- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

## Purpose

- Reduces transcript size for more efficient processing
- Focuses on actions and results rather than full message content
- Makes transcripts easier to analyze for memory extraction
- Improves token efficiency when processing with Claude Haiku

This condensed format is used when passing transcripts to the memory extraction pipeline, making it easier to identify significant events and learnings that should be memorialized.
