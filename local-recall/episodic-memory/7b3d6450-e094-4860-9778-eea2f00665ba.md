# Claude Transcript File Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` with directory names that are URL-encoded versions of the project's working directory path. For a project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`, the transcripts are stored at `~/.claude/projects/Users%2Fjoe%2FCode%2FSyntessera%2Flocal-recall/transcripts/`.

Each transcript is a JSONL file where each line is a JSON object representing an event in the session. The MCP server can parse these transcript files to extract memories and create persistent records.
