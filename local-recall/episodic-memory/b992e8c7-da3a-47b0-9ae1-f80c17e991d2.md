The Stop hook is disabled - memory extraction is now handled by the MCP server daemon which runs asynchronously every 5 minutes. This was a design change from the original architecture. The daemon syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, processes them using the memory extractor, and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes to detect changes. This decouples memory extraction from the immediate session end, allowing for more reliable processing.
