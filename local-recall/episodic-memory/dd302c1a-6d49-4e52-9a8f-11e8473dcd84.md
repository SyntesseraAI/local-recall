Removed outdated SQLite-related gitignore patterns (sqlite-vec, better-sqlite3, .sqlite files) from both `local-recall/.gitignore` and the gitignore generation utility in `src/utils/gitignore.ts`. These references were left over from the pre-Orama architecture and no longer needed since the codebase fully migrated to Orama (pure JavaScript vector store).
