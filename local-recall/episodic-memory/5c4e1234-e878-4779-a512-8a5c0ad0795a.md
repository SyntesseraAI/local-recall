The memory extraction prompt in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts defines what types of information should be extracted from transcripts:

**DO Extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations or optimizations

**DO NOT Extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

**Scope Selection:**
- `global` - Entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a file
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area

The prompt also emphasizes being specific (include file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help future assistants).
