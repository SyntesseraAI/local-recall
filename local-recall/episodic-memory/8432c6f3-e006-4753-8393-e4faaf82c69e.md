The memory extraction system uses the Claude API (claude-opus model) to process transcripts and extract meaningful memories. The extraction uses a structured prompt (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) that guides Claude to identify key insights, learnings, and architectural decisions from session transcripts. This approach ensures semantic understanding rather than simple pattern matching.
