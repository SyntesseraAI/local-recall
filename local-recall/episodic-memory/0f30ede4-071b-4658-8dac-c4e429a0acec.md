Local Recall offers two integration approaches: (1) Hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop) that inject memories into Claude's context during sessions, (2) MCP server with exposed tools (memory_create, memory_delete, memory_search, memory_list, index_rebuild) for programmatic access. Hooks are synchronous for immediate context, while MCP server includes async background processing. Both can be used together.
