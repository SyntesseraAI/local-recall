The memory system implements CRD (Create, Read, Delete) operations only - no update operation.

**Design rationale**: Memories are treated as immutable historical records. When something changes:
1. Old memory is deleted (if needed)
2. New memory is created with updated information

This approach:
- Maintains a clear audit trail of what was known and when
- Prevents accidental overwriting of important context
- Simplifies the system (idempotent creates)
- Works well with Git version control

**Memory Manager file**: src/core/memory.ts contains the core CRUD implementation.
