Extraction prompts are centralized in the src/prompts/ directory. The memory-extraction.ts prompt defines the expected memory format and instructions for Claude Haiku when processing transcripts.

This separation of concerns allows:
- Easy modification of extraction behavior without changing extractor logic
- Consistent prompt versioning
- Clear documentation of memory format requirements
