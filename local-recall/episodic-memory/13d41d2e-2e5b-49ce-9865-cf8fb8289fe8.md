# Claude Project Transcripts Storage

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Encoding

The project folder name is derived from the working directory's absolute path with:
- All forward slashes (`/`) replaced with dashes (`-`)
- Leading dash removed

Example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line) in the project's transcripts directory.

This encoding scheme is important for the transcript-collector to correctly locate and sync transcripts from Claude's cache.
