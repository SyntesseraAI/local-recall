The memory extraction prompt in `memory-extraction.ts` includes explicit instructions about JSON field names that Claude should use: `subject`, `keywords`, `applies_to`, and `content`. The prompt also specifies that `applies_to` should be one of: `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`. Additionally, it lists guidelines for what to extract and what to avoid, helping Claude produce consistent, high-quality memories.
