Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. Memory files are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` as individual markdown files with YAML frontmatter metadata. Each memory has fields: id (UUID), subject, keywords, applies_to (global|file:|area:), occurred_at (ISO-8601), and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix). Memory files are version-controlled in git.
