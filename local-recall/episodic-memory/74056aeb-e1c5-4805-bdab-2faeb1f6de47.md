Three hooks integrate Local Recall with Claude Code:
1. **SessionStart**: Loads all memories from disk and returns 5 most recent memories (full reload, no vector store to avoid slow startup)
2. **UserPromptSubmit**: Initializes vector store (lazy, cached after first use) and performs semantic search, outputs matching memories
3. **Stop**: Currently disabled - memory extraction is handled by MCP server daemon processing transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes

Hooks are configured in `hooks.json` and execute as shell commands receiving/returning JSON via stdin/stdout.
