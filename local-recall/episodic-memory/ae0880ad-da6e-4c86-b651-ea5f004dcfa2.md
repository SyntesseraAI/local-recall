Identified potential development directions:

1. **CLI Implementation** - Add command-line interface with `init`, `search`, `list`, `create` commands for memory management outside of Claude Code

2. **Memory Deduplication** - Detect and intelligently merge similar memories to reduce redundancy and improve search accuracy

3. **Memory Decay/Pruning** - Implement automatic archival or deletion of stale memories based on age and relevance

4. **Context-Aware Retrieval** - Enhance memory loading to be aware of currently open files and project context

5. **Improved Stop Hook Analysis** - Better automatic memory extraction from transcripts with smarter keyword and summary generation

6. **Live Testing** - Install and test the plugin in a real project to validate functionality and identify improvements

Session was focused on assessing what exists and what needs building rather than implementation.
