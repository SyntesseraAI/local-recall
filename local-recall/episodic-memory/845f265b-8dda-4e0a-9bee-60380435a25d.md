The memory extraction prompt is carefully crafted to guide Claude Haiku toward extracting memories that are:
- **Specific**: Include file paths, function names, line numbers, and concrete details
- **Actionable**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently
- **Non-trivial**: Exclude generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and obvious information
- **Codebase-specific**: Focus on unique patterns, configurations, and quirks of local-recall

The prompt explicitly filters out sensitive data, temporary debug steps, and information that becomes outdated quickly.
