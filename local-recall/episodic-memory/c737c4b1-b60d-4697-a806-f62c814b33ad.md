The user requested removing all trigger patterns (like 'remember this', 'save this for later') and instead save all messages without any filtering.

Changes made:
- Removed `USER_TRIGGER_PATTERNS` regex from `src/utils/transcript.ts` that matched user-triggered phrases
- Removed `AUTO_DETECT_PATTERNS` heuristics that detected architecture decisions, bugfixes, discoveries, and conventions
- Simplified `analyzeForMemories()` function to iterate through all messages and save each one
- Messages are formatted with role prefix (`**user**:` or `**assistant**:`)
- Empty messages are still skipped for cleanliness

This is a major behavioral change - the system now captures all conversation content rather than using selective filtering based on keywords or patterns.
