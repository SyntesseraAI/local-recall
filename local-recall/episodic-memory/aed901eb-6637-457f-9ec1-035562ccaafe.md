When Claude Code runs in explanatory mode, insights are displayed as styled text within regular `text` content blocks, not as a separate content block type. They use a distinctive format with backticks and the ★ Insight marker. Since these are part of the text output, they are already captured in thinking memory extraction as part of the `## Output` section. No special handling is needed to capture them separately.
