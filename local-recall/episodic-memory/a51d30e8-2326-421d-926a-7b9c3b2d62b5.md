The memory system prevents duplicate memories using two key fields: `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp of when the original event occurred) and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix of 16 characters). Before creating a new memory, the system checks if a memory with the same occurred_at and content_hash already exists.
