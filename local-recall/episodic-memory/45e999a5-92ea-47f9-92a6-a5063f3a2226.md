When processing transcripts for memory extraction, the system needs to handle API rate limits gracefully. If the Claude API reaches its rate limit during keyword extraction, the hook should either:
1. Fail gracefully with a clear error message
2. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Use cached/fallback keyword extraction methods

This is critical for the background daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes.
