The memory extraction process uses a transcript-collector utility to condense transcripts before extracting memories. This helps manage context window and focuses on the most important information. The condensed transcript format includes events like [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], and [Result: OK/ERROR] to capture the key points of what happened during the session.
