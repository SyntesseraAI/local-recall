The `syncTranscripts()` method should check both modification time (mtime) AND file size to detect changes. This provides more robust change detection than mtime alone. The full processing pipeline already handles reprocessing via content hash in `processTranscript()` - when a transcript is copied, it computes the SHA-256 hash and if changed, deletes old memories and creates new ones.

Implementation: Updated the sync condition to skip files only if BOTH mtime and size are unchanged.
