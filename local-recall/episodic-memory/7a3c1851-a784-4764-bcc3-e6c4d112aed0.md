The memory extraction process analyzes Claude Code session transcripts that are condensed into events with specific markers:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This structured format is used by the transcript parser to extract memories from sessions. The memory extraction system processes these condensed transcripts to identify valuable knowledge that should be retained across sessions.
