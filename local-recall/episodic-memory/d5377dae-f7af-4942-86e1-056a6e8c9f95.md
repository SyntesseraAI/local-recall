The MCP server includes a background daemon that syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/), processes them using `claude -p`, and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection. This runs asynchronously every 5 minutes. The Stop hook is currently disabled in favor of this daemon approach.
