The memory-extractor module uses the Claude API (via @anthropic-sdk) to analyze session transcripts and extract memories. It implements streaming responses to handle potentially large transcripts efficiently. The system processes condensed transcripts containing events marked with [User], [Assistant], and [Tool] tags to identify valuable contextual information for future sessions.
