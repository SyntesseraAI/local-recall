The Local Recall plugin uses `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable in hook configuration to reference scripts relative to the plugin installation directory. This allows hooks to work correctly whether the plugin is installed as an npm package or run from the project directory.

Hooks receive `cwd` via stdin to operate on the user's project directory, not the plugin directory. This separation allows the memory system to work with any project that installs the plugin.
