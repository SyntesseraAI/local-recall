The codebase is organized with: `src/core/` for memory CRUD and vector store operations, `src/hooks/` for Claude Code integration (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop hooks), `src/mcp-server/` for MCP server implementation, and `src/utils/` for utilities. Memory files use UUID IDs, YAML frontmatter with keywords, scope (global/file/area), timestamps, and content hashes for deduplication.
