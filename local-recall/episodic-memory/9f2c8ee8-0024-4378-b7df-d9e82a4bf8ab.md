Effective memory extraction should capture: architectural decisions and reasoning, bug fixes with root cause analysis, code patterns specific to the project, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, and performance optimizations. Memories should be specific (include file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help avoid mistakes or work more efficiently). Avoid extracting generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, sensitive data, or information that will become outdated.
