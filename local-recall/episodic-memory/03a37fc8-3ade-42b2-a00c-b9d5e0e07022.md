When extracting memories, focus on:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Quickly outdated information

Memories should be specific (include file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes).
