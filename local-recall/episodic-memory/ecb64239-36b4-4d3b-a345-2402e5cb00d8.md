When using the Claude prompt tool (`claude -p`) to process large text (like condensed transcripts), the output comes back without clear delimiters between results. Multiple calls to `claude -p` in sequence may concatenate their outputs. This requires careful parsing - outputs should be captured separately and processed individually rather than relying on line breaks or other delimiters between sequential calls.
