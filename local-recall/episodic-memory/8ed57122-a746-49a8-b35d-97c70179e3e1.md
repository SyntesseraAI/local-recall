# Local Recall Project Context

The user is working on 'local-recall', a markdown-powered memory system that allows Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions.

## Key Understanding

The project enables:
- Storage and retrieval of contextual information about codebases
- Knowledge sharing across different coding sessions
- Persistent memories stored locally within repositories

This is meta-contextual: the user is building a system to extract memories from Claude sessions (like this one) using transcript analysis. Understanding this helps maintain consistency with the project's goals and conventions.
