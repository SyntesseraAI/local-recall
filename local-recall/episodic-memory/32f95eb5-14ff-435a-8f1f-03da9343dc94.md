Claude stores project session data in `~/.claude/projects/` with directory names that encode the project path. For example, a project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` has a corresponding directory named something like `Syntes...` (truncated hash of the full path). This is where transcripts and session data are stored.
