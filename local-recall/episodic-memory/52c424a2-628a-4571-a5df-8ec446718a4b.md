# Transcript Parsing Requirements

## JSONL Format

Transcripts are stored as newline-delimited JSON (JSONL), not standard JSON arrays. Each line is a valid JSON object.

## Parsing Approach

- Must read files line-by-line
- Each line is independently valid JSON
- Cannot use standard `JSON.parse()` on the entire file
- Errors on individual lines should be handled gracefully

## Implementation Details

- Use line-by-line readers for large files (memory efficiency)
- Validate each JSON object as it's parsed
- Skip or log invalid lines rather than failing completely
- Maintain position tracking for debugging
