Memory `applies_to` field controls scope: `global` applies everywhere, `file:/path/to/file` is specific to that file, `area:component-name` applies to a component area. Scope affects when memories are injected into Claude's context via hooks. Global memories are always included; file-specific memories only when that file is being edited; area memories only when working in that area.
