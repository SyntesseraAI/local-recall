The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku via the Claude API to analyze condensed transcripts and extract valuable memories. The extractor:

- Takes condensed transcript events as input
- Calls Claude Haiku with a structured prompt to identify memories
- Parses the response to create memory objects
- Handles API errors and retries

This is implemented in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` and uses prompts from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`.
