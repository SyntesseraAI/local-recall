# Git Configuration for Local Recall

## Version-Controlled
- Memory markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` ARE tracked in git
- These files are meant to be shared among team members and persisted
- Auto-generated `.gitignore` file is placed in memory directory

## Git-Ignored
- `local-recall/memory.sqlite` - SQLite database (auto-generated, contains vector embeddings)
- `local-recall/recall.log` - Debug log file (auto-generated)
- `local_cache/` - Embedding model cache (downloaded once, ~133MB)

## Important Note
Memory files will be committed to git as they represent valuable project knowledge. The database and logs are artifacts that can be regenerated.
