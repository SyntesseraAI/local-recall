# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files with the naming convention:
- Session IDs from `session_id` field (UUID format)
- Files end with `.jsonl`
- Each line is a separate JSON event

## Usage

This is essential for:
- The MCP server background daemon to find and process transcripts
- The stop hook to extract memories from completed sessions
- Syncing transcripts from Claude's cache into local-recall's memory system
