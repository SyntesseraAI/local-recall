The project contains prompt templates in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guide Claude's memory extraction process. These prompts define how to structure extracted memories with proper YAML frontmatter fields (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash) and markdown content. The prompts ensure consistency in memory format across all extracted memories.
