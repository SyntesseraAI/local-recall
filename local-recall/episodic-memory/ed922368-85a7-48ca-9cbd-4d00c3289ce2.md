Local Recall implements semantic search using the fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). The model is automatically downloaded and cached in `local_cache/` directory on first use. Initial startup may take 30-60 seconds for model download, but subsequent runs load from cache. If the tokenizer file becomes corrupted, removing the `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` directory will trigger re-download on next run.
