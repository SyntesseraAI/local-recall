The memory-extractor.ts module handles transcript processing and memory extraction with streaming capabilities. It processes transcripts line-by-line using event emitters, allowing for efficient handling of large transcripts without loading entire content into memory. The module includes streaming event handlers for progress tracking and error handling during extraction.
