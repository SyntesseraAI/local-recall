Memory files include a `content_hash` field (SHA-256 prefix, 16 chars) that enables deduplication. The system can check for existing duplicates using `findDuplicate(occurredAt, contentHash)` before creating new memories. This ensures that re-processing the same transcript doesn't create multiple copies of the same memory.
