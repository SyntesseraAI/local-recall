# Code Simplicity Preference

The user values clean, simple code over over-engineered solutions. During transcript collector development:

- Avoid creating generic path resolution utilities for one-time operations
- Don't abstract functionality that's only used in one place
- Keep functions focused and straightforward
- YAGNI principle: You Aren't Gonna Need It - don't build for hypothetical future scenarios

This preference aligns with keeping the codebase maintainable and avoiding unnecessary complexity.
