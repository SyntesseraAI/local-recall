# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the working directory path, with special characters replaced by underscores. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`
- Transcripts location: `~/.claude/projects/Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

## Usage

This is important for:
- MCP servers that need to process transcripts
- Background daemons that sync transcript data
- Tools that need to access session history

## Implications

The MCP background daemon in local-recall uses this path to sync transcripts and extract memories every 5 minutes.
