The project root (local-recall/) IS the plugin root. Structure includes .claude-plugin/plugin.json (metadata), hooks.json (hook event handlers), .mcp.json (MCP config), and scripts/ directory for bundled executables. Scripts are built output (gitignored) in scripts/hooks/ and scripts/mcp-server/. Plugin can be installed by cloning and building, or added to .claude/settings.json with hooks configuration.
