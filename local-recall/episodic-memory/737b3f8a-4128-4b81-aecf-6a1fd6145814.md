The MCP server runs a background daemon that syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, processes them using `claude -p` to extract memories, and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection. Memories are deleted and recreated when transcripts change. The daemon runs on a 5-minute interval.
