The memory extraction prompt (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) provides comprehensive guidelines for identifying valuable memories from transcripts. It instructs Claude to extract: architectural decisions and reasoning, bug fixes and root cause analysis, code patterns/conventions specific to the project, configuration quirks/gotchas, user preferences, component relationships, and performance optimizations. The prompt explicitly warns against extracting generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, trivial information, sensitive data, or outdated information.
