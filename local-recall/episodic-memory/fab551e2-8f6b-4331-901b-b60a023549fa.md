Prompt templates and configurations for memory extraction are centralized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This file likely contains:
- Prompts for extracting memories from transcripts
- Prompts for condensing transcripts
- Prompt templates for keyword extraction
- Guidelines for memory structure and format

Centralizing prompts allows for easy maintenance and iteration on extraction strategies.
