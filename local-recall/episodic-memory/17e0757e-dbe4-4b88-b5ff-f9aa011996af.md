The Stop hook is currently disabled. Memory extraction is handled by the MCP server daemon which processes transcripts asynchronously. The daemon syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/), processes them using `claude -p` to extract memories, tracks processed transcripts with content hashes, and runs every 5 minutes.
