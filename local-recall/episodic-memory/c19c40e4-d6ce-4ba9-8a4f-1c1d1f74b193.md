Memory extraction intentionally filters out:
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps without long-term value
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly
- Internal LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL metadata and transcript analysis instructions

The extraction focuses on extracting memories that are specific to the codebase, include file paths and function names, and help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently.
