The memory extraction system analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to automatically create structured memory files. The process:

1. Takes condensed transcript format with events like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, `[Result: OK/ERROR]`
2. Feeds transcript through Claude Haiku with extraction prompt
3. Claude identifies valuable memories based on guidelines:
   - What was learned
   - What is now known
   - Project-specific patterns
   - Problems solved
4. Creates memory records with subject, keywords, scope, and content

This enables future sessions to benefit from accumulated knowledge without manual curation.
