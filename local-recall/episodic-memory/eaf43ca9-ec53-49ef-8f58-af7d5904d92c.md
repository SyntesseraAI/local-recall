Memory extraction logic uses separate prompt files (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) to define:

- System prompts for Claude to understand memory extraction task
- Instructions for identifying relevant concepts from transcripts
- Format expectations for extracted memory objects
- This separation keeps extraction logic decoupled from core memory management
