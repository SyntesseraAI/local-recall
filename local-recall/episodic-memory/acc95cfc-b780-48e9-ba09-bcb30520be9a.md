# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in `transcripts/` subdirectory:
- File name format: `<timestamp>-<session-hash>.jsonl`
- Each line is a complete JSON object representing one message/event
- Both user messages and assistant messages are included

## Importance for Memory Extraction

The MCP server's transcript collector uses this path to:
1. Find and read transcript files automatically
2. Extract memories from conversation history
3. Detect changes using content hashes for duplicate prevention
4. Process transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes
