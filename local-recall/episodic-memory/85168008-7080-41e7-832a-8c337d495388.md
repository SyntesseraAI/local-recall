Git history shows two major migrations: (1) commit 346e499 migrated from markdown files to a single thinking.jsonl file, (2) a recent commit changed to multi-file format (thinking-000001.jsonl). The old thinking.jsonl (2.8MB with 2,121 lines) is a leftover artifact that should be cleaned up. Current thinking-000001.jsonl has only 155 lines, indicating incomplete migration of all markdown records.
