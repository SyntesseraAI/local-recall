Local Recall is a project that creates a persistent memory layer for Claude Code and other AI tools via MCP. It allows multiple AI agents to store and retrieve contextual information about codebases, share knowledge across sessions, and maintain project-specific memories. All memories are stored locally as version-controlled markdown files with YAML frontmatter.
