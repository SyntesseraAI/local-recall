# Local Recall Project Overview

The user (Joe) is actively developing Local Recall, a markdown-powered memory system that enables:
- Claude Code and other AI tools to retain context across sessions
- Storing and retrieving contextual information about codebases
- Sharing knowledge across different coding sessions
- Version-controlled memory files within the repository

## Current Focus

The project uses:
- TypeScript/Node.js for implementation
- SQLite with vector embeddings for semantic search
- Episodic memory files stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
- MCP server for exposing memory tools
- Claude Code hooks for integration (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop)

## Key Infrastructure

- Memory files are structured markdown with YAML frontmatter
- Vector store uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for embeddings
- Background daemon processes transcripts every 5 minutes
- Memories are idempotent (no updates, only create/delete)
