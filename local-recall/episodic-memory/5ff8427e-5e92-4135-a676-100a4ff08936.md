# MCP Server Background Processing

The MCP server in local-recall runs as a background daemon during Claude Code sessions and processes transcripts asynchronously.

## Processing Model

- Server runs continuously in the background
- Processes transcripts periodically (approximately every 5 minutes)
- Does NOT process transcripts in real-time on each user message
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- When a transcript changes, deletes old memories and recreates them

## Implications

This asynchronous approach means:
- There can be a delay between user actions and memory extraction
- The Stop hook is disabled because the MCP server handles memory extraction
- Memories are created/updated based on transcript polling, not immediate events
- The system is resilient to duplicate processing through content hash checking
