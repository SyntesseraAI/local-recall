Claude Code fetches plugins from GitHub repositories. The MCP server startup failure was caused by `local-recall-plugin/scripts/` being in .gitignore, so the plugin directory was missing required startup scripts. Solution: Remove plugin script directories from .gitignore and commit them to git so they're available when Claude Code clones the repository.

Key insight: For npm packages distributed via GitHub, any runtime files (scripts, configs, etc.) must be git-tracked - .gitignore exclusions apply during npm install from git URLs.
