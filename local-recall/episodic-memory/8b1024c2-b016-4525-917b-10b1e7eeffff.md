Transcripts are condensed before being sent to Claude Haiku for memory extraction. This preprocessing step:

- Reduces transcript size to focus on essential information
- Decreases token usage and processing cost
- Maintains enough detail for accurate memory extraction
- Is applied in the memory extraction workflow

This is an important optimization for the MCP server's background daemon which processes transcripts regularly.
