# Transcript Collector Path Resolution

The transcript collector module is responsible for:
1. Taking the user's working directory
2. Converting it to Claude's project naming convention (path with dashes)
3. Locating transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/<project-name>/transcripts/`
4. Processing JSONL transcript files for memory extraction

This is critical for the MCP server daemon which processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes to extract and create memories from session activity.

## Current State

`src/core/transcript-collector.ts` exists but implementation details need to be reviewed to ensure it correctly:
- Handles the path conversion logic
- Locates the user's home directory reliably
- Reads and parses JSONL transcript files
- Filters for relevant transcript events
