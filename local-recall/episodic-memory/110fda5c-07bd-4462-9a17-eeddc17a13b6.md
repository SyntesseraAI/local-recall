Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. Key architecture points:

- Memory files stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` as markdown with YAML frontmatter
- Memory files ARE version-controlled in git (unlike SQLite database which is gitignored)
- Core components in `src/core/`: memory.ts, vector-store.ts, embedding.ts, search.ts
- Hooks in `src/hooks/`: session-start.ts, user-prompt-submit.ts, stop.ts
- Vector embeddings use fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB)
- Memory format includes: id (UUID), subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash fields
