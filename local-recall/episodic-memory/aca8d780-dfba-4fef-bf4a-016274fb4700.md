The UserPromptSubmit hook receives a JSON input object containing the user's prompt as a field. This allows the hook to extract keywords from the prompt and perform context-aware memory searches before Claude processes the user's request.

This is used in src/hooks/user-prompt-submit.ts to search for relevant memories based on the current user query.
