When extracting memories from transcripts, prioritize:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns/conventions specific to project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

Each memory should be specific (include file paths, function names), concise (one concept), and actionable.
