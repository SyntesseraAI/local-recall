Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows Claude Code and other AI tools (via MCP) to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. All memories are stored locally within the repository as version-controllable markdown files with YAML frontmatter.

Key architectural components:
- Memory Manager: CRD operations for memory files
- Index Manager: Maintains searchable keyword index
- Search: Fuzzy search implementation
- Claude Code Hooks: SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop hooks
- MCP Server: Exposes memory tools to compatible clients

Memory files use YAML frontmatter with fields: id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash
