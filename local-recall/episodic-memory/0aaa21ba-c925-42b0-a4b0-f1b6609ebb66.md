# Semantic Search Implementation

## Technology Choice

Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search:
- Model: `BGE-small-en-v1.5` (~133MB)
- Purpose: Convert text to vector embeddings for semantic similarity matching
- First run: Downloads model automatically to `local_cache/` (30-60 seconds)
- Subsequent runs: Loads from cache

## Implementation Files

- `src/core/vector-store.ts`: Vector database implementation
- `src/core/embedding.ts`: Embedding generation and management

## Why Semantic Search

Beyond keyword/fuzzy matching, semantic search allows:
- Finding memories about similar concepts even with different wording
- Better relevance ranking based on conceptual similarity
- More intuitive memory retrieval for users

## Considerations

- Model cache can become corrupted on interrupted downloads
- Recovery: Delete `local_cache/` directory and re-run (model re-downloads)
- Performance: First run slower due to model download, cached runs fast
