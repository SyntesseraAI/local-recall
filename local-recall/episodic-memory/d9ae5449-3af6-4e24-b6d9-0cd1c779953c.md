The memory-extractor.ts module is responsible for processing Claude Code session transcripts and extracting valuable memories. It uses the Claude API (via claude -p command) to intelligently parse transcripts and generate structured memory objects that can be stored in the episodic-memory directory. The extractor takes condensed transcript events and converts them into memories with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content.
