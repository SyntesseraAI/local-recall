Memory metadata includes an `applies_to` field that specifies the scope of applicability:
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:memory-extraction`)

This scoping helps future assistants understand the context and applicability of each memory.
