Vector store search results use cosine distance similarity scoring:
- Score range: 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (identical)
- Scores rounded to 2 decimal places
- Results sorted by score descending
- Recency tie-breaker: When scores are equal, more recent memories (by `occurred_at`) rank first

This ensures consistent, deterministic search results with proper ranking.
