The memory extraction process uses the Anthropic Claude API (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 model) with streaming enabled. The MemoryExtractor class in src/core/memory-extractor.ts:

- Uses the Anthropic SDK to instantiate a client
- Calls `client.messages.create()` with streaming enabled
- Processes the response stream to accumulate text content
- Handles stream events including 'content_block_delta' for text updates
- Parses the accumulated response as JSON containing memory objects

This approach allows for efficient processing of long transcripts without loading entire responses into memory.
