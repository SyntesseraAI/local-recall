# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by underscores. For example:
- `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`

## Transcript File Structure

- Location: `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`
- Format: JSONL (JSON Lines - one JSON object per line)
- Each line contains a single message object from the session
- Messages include metadata like timestamps, user/assistant role, and content

## Key Details

- Transcript files are created as new sessions start
- Each message is a complete JSON object on its own line
- The transcript collector reads these files to extract memories
- Files can be quite large after long sessions due to line-by-line storage

This is crucial for the memory extraction daemon that processes transcripts to create persistent memories.
