When thinking memories are retrieved during a session, they are injected into context under the heading **"Local Recall: Previous Thoughts"** with metadata including:

- The thinking content (what Claude was reasoning about)
- The output content (what Claude produced)
- Similarity score (as a percentage, e.g., 67%)
- Occurrence timestamp
- Memory ID and scope

This provides concrete examples of "how I reasoned → what I produced" for similar tasks from previous sessions, helping maintain consistency in reasoning patterns across sessions.
