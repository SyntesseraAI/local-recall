# Transcript Collector Implementation

The `transcript-collector.ts` file is responsible for:

## Main Responsibilities
1. **Transcript Discovery**: Locates and reads transcript files from Claude's project cache
2. **Memory Extraction**: Uses Claude Haiku to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories
3. **Deduplication**: Tracks processed transcripts using content hashes to avoid re-processing
4. **Memory Creation**: Creates memory files based on extracted information

## Key Functions
- `collectMemoriesFromTranscript()` - Main entry point that orchestrates the process
- `describeTranscript()` - Uses Claude Haiku API with `claude -p` to analyze and extract memories
- Hash-based tracking for change detection

## Important Notes
- Haiku is used for the lightweight analysis of transcripts
- The system uses content hashes to determine if a transcript has been processed before
- This collector is part of the MCP server daemon that runs every 5 minutes
- The process helps maintain a searchable memory index for future sessions
