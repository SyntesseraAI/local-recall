The vector store is SQLite-backed using the better-sqlite3 library with the sqlite-vec extension. It uses the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) loaded via fastembed for semantic search. Search results use cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0-1.0 range). The database file (memory.sqlite) is gitignored and auto-generated. Model is cached in local_cache/ directory.
