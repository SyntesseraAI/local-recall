When extracting memories from Claude Code session transcripts, focus on:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during the session
- Important relationships between components

Do NOT extract generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious/trivial information, sensitive data, or quickly outdated information. Each memory should be specific, actionable, and help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently.
