# Claude Code Transcript Storage Location

Claude Code stores session transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` with the following naming convention:

- Directory name: URL-encoded absolute path with dashes instead of slashes
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`
- Each transcript entry is a JSON line containing `role` ("user" or "assistant") and `content`

This is important for the MCP server's background daemon which syncs transcripts from Claude's cache and processes them to extract memories.
