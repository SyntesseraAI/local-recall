# Memory Extraction with Haiku

## Command Format

Memory extraction uses the `claude -p --model haiku` command to process transcripts.

The `-p` flag enables prompt caching, which is useful for:
- Reducing token costs when processing large transcripts
- Improving performance on repeated analysis
- Handling long transcript contexts efficiently

## Process

1. Transcript content is passed to `claude -p --model haiku`
2. Haiku analyzes the conversation and extracts memories
3. Memories are formatted with YAML frontmatter and markdown content
4. Results are used to create new memory files or update existing ones

## Why Haiku

Haiku is used for memory extraction (rather than a larger model) because:
- Fast and cost-effective
- Sufficient capability for extracting key learnings from transcripts
- Complements the system's philosophy of efficient local processing

## Location

This command is invoked in the MCP server's transcript processing daemon.
