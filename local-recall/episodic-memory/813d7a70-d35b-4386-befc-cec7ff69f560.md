The vector store implementation uses `better-sqlite3` with the `sqlite-vec` extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings are generated using `fastembed` with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). Scoring uses cosine distance (0.0-1.0), rounded to 2 decimal places. Results are sorted by score descending with recency tie-breaker when scores are equal.
