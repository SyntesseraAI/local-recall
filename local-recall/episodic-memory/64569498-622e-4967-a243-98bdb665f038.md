# Transcript Extraction Format

Claude's transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) format where each line is a JSON event object.

## Event Types

Transcripts contain condensed events:
- `[User]` - User questions or requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses or explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool invocations

## Memory Extraction

When processing transcripts for memories:
- Extract valuable learnings and insights
- Focus on architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns
- Use specific scope (`global`, `file:<path>`, `area:<name>`)
- Avoid generic knowledge or temporary debugging steps
- Include concrete file paths and function names
