The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API with streaming to process transcripts and extract valuable memories. The system:

- Uses `Anthropic` client to interact with Claude models
- Implements streaming response handling for efficient processing
- Processes transcripts asynchronously
- Extracts memories based on semantic understanding of transcript content
- Uses prompts defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide the extraction process

This approach allows for efficient, non-blocking transcript analysis that can run as a background daemon.
