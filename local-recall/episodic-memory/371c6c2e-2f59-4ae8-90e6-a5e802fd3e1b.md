Different Claude Code environments have varying hook support:

- **SessionStart**: Fires reliably in VS Code extension
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Fires reliably in VS Code extension  
- **Stop**: Does NOT fire in VS Code extension (or fires rarely)

Hooks are configured in `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/config/hooks.json`. When designing features that depend on hooks, the MCP daemon is a more reliable fallback mechanism for environments with limited hook support.
