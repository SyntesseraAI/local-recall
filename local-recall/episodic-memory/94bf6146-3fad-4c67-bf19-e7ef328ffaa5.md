# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

Project folders are named using the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory:
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`
- Format: JSONL (JSON Lines - one JSON object per line)
- Each line represents a single message in the conversation

## Implications for Transcript Collection

The transcript-collector needs to:
1. Construct the project folder path by replacing slashes with dashes in the absolute working directory
2. Look in `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/` for JSONL files
3. Parse JSONL format (not standard JSON array)
4. Be aware this is macOS-specific path handling

This is critical for the background daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes to extract memories.
