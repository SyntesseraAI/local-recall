The memory extractor (src/core/memory-extractor.ts) uses the Claude API with the memory-extraction prompt to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. It processes transcripts asynchronously and returns structured memory objects with metadata like subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content. This is a core component for converting session activity into persistent memories.
