Claude Code stores project data in `~/.claude/projects/` with directory names that are URL-encoded versions of the project path. For example, the local-recall project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` has its transcripts stored in `~/.claude/projects/Users%2Fjoe%2FCode%2FSyntessera%2Flocal-recall/transcripts/`. This is important for tools that need to locate and process session transcripts.
