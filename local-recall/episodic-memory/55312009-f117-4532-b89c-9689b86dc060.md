# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The memory extraction process uses transcript condensing to improve efficiency when extracting memories from Claude Code session transcripts.

## Why Condensing?

Full transcripts can be very long and contain redundant information. Condensing reduces the context needed for memory extraction while preserving the essential information.

## Condensed Format

Transcripts are condensed into events:
- `[User]` - What the user asked or requested
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude said or explained
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

## Implementation

This condensing is implemented in the codebase, likely in transcript processing utilities.
