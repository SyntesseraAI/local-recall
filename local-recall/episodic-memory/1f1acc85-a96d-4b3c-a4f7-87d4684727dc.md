# Repository Structure and Build Organization

Local Recall follows a specific organizational pattern:

## Source Files
- TypeScript source code is located in `src/`
- Organized by feature: `src/core/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/mcp-server/`, `src/utils/`

## Build Output
- Compiled JavaScript is placed in `scripts/` directory
- `scripts/` is gitignored to avoid committing build artifacts
- Build targets include:
  - `scripts/hooks/` - Compiled hook executables
  - `scripts/mcp-server/` - Compiled MCP server executable

## Build Process

- TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript
- Output goes to `scripts/` directory which is then used by:
  - `hooks.json` - References scripts for Claude Code hooks
  - `.mcp.json` - References MCP server script

## Important Notes

- The `scripts/` directory should be in `.gitignore` to keep the repository clean
- All source edits happen in `src/`
- Running `npm run build` generates the `scripts/` output
- Never manually edit files in `scripts/` - they are generated from `src/`
