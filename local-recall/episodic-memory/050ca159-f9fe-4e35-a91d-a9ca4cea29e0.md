Local Recall uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. Model auto-downloads to local_cache/ on first use (30-60 seconds), then loads from cache on subsequent runs. If tokenizer file not found error occurs, remove local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5* directory and model will re-download automatically.
