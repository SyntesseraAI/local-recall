The memory extractor in memory-extractor.ts uses Claude Haiku model with streaming enabled to extract memories from transcripts. The system uses transcript condensing to prepare the input before sending to Claude. The extraction process uses the prompt defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts and returns an array of extracted memory objects with proper structure for creating memory files.
