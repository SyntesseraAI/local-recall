Recent refactoring changed memory collection from an update-based pattern to an idempotent sync pattern. Memories are now create-only (no updateMemory operation). The schema was simplified by removing the created_at field and using occurred_at for sorting and deduplication. The collector syncs memories from Claude transcripts rather than building them incrementally.
