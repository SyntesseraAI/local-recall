The `src/utils/transcript.ts` module provides utilities for:
- Parsing Claude Code session transcripts
- Extracting events (user prompts, assistant responses, tool calls)
- Processing transcript content for memory extraction
- Supporting the MCP daemon's transcript processing

These utilities enable the system to automatically extract memories from session transcripts by analyzing what was discussed and accomplished.
