Memory files use YAML frontmatter for metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash) followed by markdown content. Each memory is atomic (one concept per file). Files are stored in local-recall/episodic-memory/ and local-recall/thinking-memory/ directories and are version-controlled in git.
