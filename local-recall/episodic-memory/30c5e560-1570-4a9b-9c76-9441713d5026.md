The MCP server daemon in `src/mcp-server/server.ts` was only calling `runTranscriptProcessing()` from memory-extractor.js to handle episodic memory extraction. The thinking extractor (`ThinkingExtractor` class in `src/core/thinking-extractor.ts`) existed but was never invoked by the daemon. This meant thinking memories were never being automatically extracted from transcripts like episodic memories were.

Thinking memory extraction has now been added to run in parallel with episodic extraction using separate processing flags (`isThinkingProcessing` and `isProcessing`) to prevent concurrent access issues.
