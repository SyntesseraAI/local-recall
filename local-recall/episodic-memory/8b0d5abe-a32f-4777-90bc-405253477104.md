Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. Key points:

- Stores persistent memories locally as markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- Uses SQLite with vector embeddings (BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic search
- Core components: MemoryManager, VectorStore, Embedding service, Search implementation
- Integrates with Claude Code via hooks: SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop
- MCP server exposes memory tools (memory_create, memory_get, memory_search, memory_list, index_rebuild)
- Background daemon processes transcripts every 5 minutes
- Memory files include scope field (global, file:path, or area:name) for targeted memories
- Scoring uses cosine distance (0.0-1.0), with recency as tie-breaker
- Embedding model cache in local_cache/ can be cleared if corrupted
- All features require comprehensive tests in tests/unit and tests/integration
- Documentation goes in docs/ folder
