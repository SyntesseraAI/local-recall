# Transcript Collector Implementation

The `transcript-collector.ts` module handles parsing JSONL transcript files and transforming them into a structured event format for analysis.

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Reading JSONL files**: Parses line-delimited JSON from transcript files
2. **Extracting events**: Transforms raw transcript data into discrete, analyzable events
3. **Structuring messages**: Organizes conversation data with proper metadata

## Output Format

Transcripts are condensed into events:
- `[User]` - What the user asked or requested
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude said or explained
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

## Purpose in Memory System

The structured event format produced by this module serves as input for memory extraction. By normalizing transcript data into a consistent format, it enables the memory extraction pipeline to reliably identify key learnings, architectural decisions, and solutions from conversation history.
