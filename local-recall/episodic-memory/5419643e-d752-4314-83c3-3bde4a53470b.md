# Claude Project Transcripts Location and Path Format

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Conversion to Folder Names

The folder names are derived from the project path by:
1. Converting the absolute path to a relative path from home directory
2. Replacing path separators (/) with dashes (-)
3. Creating a folder with this converted name

Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## Transcript Files

Each project folder contains transcript files that are created during Claude Code sessions.

This is important for the transcript-collector functionality which needs to locate and parse these transcripts to extract memories.
