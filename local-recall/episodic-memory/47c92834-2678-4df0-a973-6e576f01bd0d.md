# LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL Markers

## Purpose

The `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` marker is used at the beginning of memory extraction prompts to indicate that the following content is an internal instruction for analyzing transcripts and extracting memories.

## Usage

These markers are part of the transcript processing pipeline:
1. Transcripts are condensed into events format
2. A memory extraction prompt with `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` prefix is sent to Claude
3. Claude analyzes the transcript and returns JSON-formatted memories
4. The returned memories are stored as markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`

This pattern allows the system to use structured prompts for consistent memory extraction across different sessions and transcript types.
