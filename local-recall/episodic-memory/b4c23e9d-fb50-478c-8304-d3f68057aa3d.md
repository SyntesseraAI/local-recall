The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to intelligently parse transcripts and extract valuable memories. The extraction process uses a system prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides Claude to identify what was learned, architectural decisions, bug fixes, and project-specific knowledge. This approach leverages Claude's language understanding rather than regex-based parsing.
