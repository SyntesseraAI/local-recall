The memory extraction prompt file contains detailed guidelines for what constitutes a valuable memory:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

The prompt emphasizes being specific (include file paths and function names), concise (one concept per memory), actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes), and using appropriate scope (global, file:path, or area:name).
