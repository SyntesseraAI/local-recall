The Stop hook is currently disabled. Memory extraction is now handled by the MCP server daemon which:
- Processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes
- Detects changes using content hashes
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
- Runs in the background without blocking Claude's operation

This approach is more reliable than the synchronous Stop hook as it doesn't block session termination.
