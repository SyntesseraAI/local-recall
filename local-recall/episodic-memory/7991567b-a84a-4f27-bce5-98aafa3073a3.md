The extraction prompt system provides specific guidelines to Claude for what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configurations) and what to ignore (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, trivial info). It emphasizes specificity with file paths and function names, and uses appropriate scope designation (global, file:, or area:).
