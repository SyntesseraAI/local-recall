GitHub Copilot suggestions appear as inline suggestions in the IDE and may be from PR reviews or code analysis. To see these suggestions in Claude Code context, a GitHub MCP server would be needed to query GitHub API for PR comments. Currently, Claude Code can only see the actual file contents (via Read tool), not IDE-specific inline suggestions or GitHub PR metadata.
