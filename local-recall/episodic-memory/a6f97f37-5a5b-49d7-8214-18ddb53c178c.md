Implemented transcript condensing that uses Claude Haiku to generate semantic summaries of transcript events. The condenser groups consecutive user/assistant/tool events and produces concise natural language summaries. This serves two purposes: (1) provides semantic context that the memory extractor can use to identify valuable memories, and (2) reduces token usage by summarizing repetitive or exploratory interactions before sending to Claude for memory extraction.
