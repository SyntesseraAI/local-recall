The `MemoryExtractor` class in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. The system sends transcripts to Claude with a structured prompt, receives back an array of memories with metadata (subject, keywords, applies_to, content), and creates corresponding memory files. This enables semantic understanding of what happened in a session rather than simple keyword extraction.
