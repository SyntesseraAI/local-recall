Three main hooks are configured in hooks.json:
1. **SessionStart**: Loads memory index on session start, retrieves relevant memories, outputs to stdout
2. **UserPromptSubmit**: Extracts keywords from user prompt, searches memory index, outputs matching memories
3. **Stop**: Currently disabled - memory extraction is handled by MCP server daemon instead

All hooks use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` to reference scripts relative to plugin installation and receive `cwd` via stdin to operate on user's project directory.
