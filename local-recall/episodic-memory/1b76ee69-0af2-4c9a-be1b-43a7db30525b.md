The `memory-extractor.ts` module handles automated extraction of memories from session transcripts. It uses Claude Haiku model to analyze condensed transcripts and generate structured memory objects. The system processes transcripts through a prompt-based extraction workflow defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`.

Key capabilities:
- Analyzes session transcripts to identify learnings and discoveries
- Uses Claude Haiku for efficient, cost-effective analysis
- Generates structured memories with subject, keywords, scope, and content
- Integrates with the memory creation pipeline

This is part of the background MCP server daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously.
