Transcript condensing is a utility function that preprocesses transcripts before memory extraction. It reduces transcript size while preserving important context, making the memory extraction process more efficient. The function is called from `extractMemoriesFromTranscript` in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` and should be located in a utility module (likely `src/utils/transcript.ts`).
