# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Replace `~` with the home directory path
- Convert path separators and other characters to dashes
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes something like `users-joe-code-syntessera-local-recall`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files within the project folder:
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/{normalized-path}/transcripts/`
- Files are named with timestamps or session identifiers
- Each line is a JSON object representing a transcript event

## Relevance to local-recall

The transcript-collector component needs to know this path structure to sync transcripts from Claude's cache for memory extraction. The normalized folder name format must be understood when implementing transcript syncing functionality.
