Local Recall uses the fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search capabilities. The model is automatically downloaded to local_cache/ on first use (takes 30-60 seconds). Subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer errors occur, delete local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5* to force re-download.
