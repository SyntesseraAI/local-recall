Claude Code projects are stored in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The project directory names use URL encoding of the full path, e.g., `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall` with forward slashes converted to hyphens.

Transcripts for each session are stored in `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/transcripts/` directory with filenames like `transcript_<timestamp>.md`.
