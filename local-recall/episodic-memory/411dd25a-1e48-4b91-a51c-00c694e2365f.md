A new vector store system has been implemented for semantic search:

- Uses `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model
- Model is ~133MB and auto-downloads to `local_cache/` on first use
- Provides semantic similarity matching beyond keyword-based search
- Implemented in `src/core/vector-store.ts`
- Also implemented in `src/core/embedding.ts` for embedding generation
- First run takes 30-60 seconds for model download; subsequent runs are fast due to caching
