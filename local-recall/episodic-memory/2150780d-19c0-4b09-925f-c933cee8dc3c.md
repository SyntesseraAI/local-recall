Identified opportunities for future development:

1. **CLI Tools** - Add init, search, list, create commands for memory management
2. **Memory Deduplication** - Detect and merge similar memories to reduce duplication
3. **Memory Decay/Pruning** - Implement automatic archival of stale memories
4. **Smarter Retrieval** - Context-aware memory loading based on currently edited files
5. **Enhanced Stop Hook** - Improve automatic memory extraction from transcripts
6. **Live Testing** - Install plugin in real projects to validate functionality

Current implementation prioritizes core functionality. These features would improve usability and memory management efficiency.
