Updated `ensureGitignore()` to create the base `local-recall` directory using `fs.mkdirSync(..., { recursive: true })` if it doesn't already exist. This makes the initialization more robust for fresh projects that haven't been set up yet.

Previously, if the local-recall folder didn't exist, `ensureGitignore()` would fail when trying to write the file. Now it handles this gracefully by creating the directory structure first.
