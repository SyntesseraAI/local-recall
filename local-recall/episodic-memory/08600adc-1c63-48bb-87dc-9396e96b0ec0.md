Three main hooks integrate with Claude Code:

1. **SessionStart**: Loads 5 most recent memories (sorted by `occurred_at`) on session start - full reload without vector store to avoid slow initialization
2. **UserPromptSubmit**: Initializes vector store on first use, performs semantic search on user prompt, outputs matching memories
3. **Stop**: Currently disabled - memory extraction handled by MCP server daemon running every 5 minutes

Hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json` as shell commands receiving/returning JSON via stdin/stdout.
