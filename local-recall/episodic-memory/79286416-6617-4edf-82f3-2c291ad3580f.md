# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts stored in: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Each transcript is a `.jsonl` file (JSON Lines format) where each line is a separate JSON object representing an event in the session.

## Key Insight

This is critical for the transcript collector to locate and read transcript files. The path conversion (absolute path → folder name with dashes) is not immediately obvious and must be handled correctly.
