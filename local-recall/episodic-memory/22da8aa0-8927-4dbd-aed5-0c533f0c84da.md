# Transcript Condensing

A recent feature (commit 8c4fbf5) implements transcript condensing for memory extraction. This converts raw JSONL transcripts into a condensed format with structured events.

## Condensed Format

The condensed format uses tags to mark different types of events:
- `[User]` - User message or request
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's response or explanation
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocation (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of a tool invocation

## Purpose

This condensed format serves as input for Claude Haiku to extract valuable memories, making it easier for the model to identify:
1. What was learned or discovered
2. Problems that were solved
3. Code patterns or conventions applied
4. Important architectural insights
