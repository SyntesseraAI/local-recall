# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcript files are stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines format) in the project folder:
- Located at: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`
- Each session creates a new transcript file
- Files are JSONL format with one event per line

## Implications

This path structure is important for the transcript-collector component which needs to:
1. Resolve the project path from the working directory
2. Construct the correct Claude projects path
3. Find and parse transcript files for memory extraction
