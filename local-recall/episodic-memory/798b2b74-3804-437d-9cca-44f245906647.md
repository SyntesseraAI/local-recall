# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude stores project-specific session transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Directory Structure

Project folders are created based on the working directory path. The exact mapping algorithm converts filesystem paths into directory names for organizing transcripts by project.

## Usage in local-recall

The MCP server syncs transcripts from this location to extract memories asynchronously every 5 minutes, enabling persistent memory across sessions.
