# Keyword Extraction Task

The user is working on the memory extraction system for Local Recall, specifically testing keyword extraction from text. The task involves:

1. Taking raw text input
2. Extracting relevant keywords
3. Returning results as a JSON array of strings
4. No explanation or additional formatting - just the JSON array

This is part of the broader memory extraction pipeline that analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to create persistent memories for future AI assistants working on the codebase.
