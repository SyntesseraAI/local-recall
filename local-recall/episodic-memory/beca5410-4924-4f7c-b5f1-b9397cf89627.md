Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. The project root is the plugin root following Claude Code's plugin format. Key directories:

- `.claude-plugin/` - Plugin metadata
- `src/` - TypeScript source (core memory management, hooks, MCP server)
- `local-recall/` - Memory storage directory (version-controlled)
- `scripts/` - Built/bundled executables (gitignored)

Memory files are markdown with YAML frontmatter stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`. The index is auto-generated and gitignored at `local-recall/index.json`.
