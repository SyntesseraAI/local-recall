The memory-extraction.ts file contains prompt templates that guide Claude in analyzing transcripts. These prompts define what constitutes valuable memories (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks) versus non-valuable information (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, trivial information). The prompts emphasize being specific with file paths and function names, being concise with one concept per memory, and using appropriate scope (global, file, or area).
