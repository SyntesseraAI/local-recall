The memory extraction process uses the Claude API with streaming enabled to handle transcript analysis efficiently. The system extracts memories by:
1. Taking a transcript as input
2. Using a specialized prompt to identify and extract relevant memories
3. Streaming responses to reduce token usage and improve performance
4. Parsing the streamed output to create structured memory objects

This approach is more efficient than loading entire responses into memory at once.
