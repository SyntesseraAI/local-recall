Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows multiple AI agents (Claude Code and other tools via MCP) to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. All memories are stored locally within the repository, making them version-controllable and shareable among team members. The project is located at /Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall.
