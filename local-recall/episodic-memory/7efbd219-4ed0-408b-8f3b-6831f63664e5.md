The Stop hook is disabled in favor of an MCP server daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. The daemon:
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache
- Uses `claude -p` to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
