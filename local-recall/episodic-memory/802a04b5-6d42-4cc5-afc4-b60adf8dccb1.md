The user (Joe) is actively developing the transcript collection and memory extraction functionality for Local Recall.

## Current Focus

Working on `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` to:
1. Locate and read Claude Code session transcripts from the system cache
2. Parse `.jsonl` transcript files
3. Extract memories using the memory creation system
4. Track processed transcripts to avoid duplicates

## Key Understanding

- This is for the background daemon that runs every 5 minutes
- Transcripts need to be found dynamically from `~/.claude/projects/`
- The path construction requires special handling (slashes to dashes)
- Memory extraction should create memories based on what was done in the session

## Git Branch

Working on branch: `claude/refactor-memory-collection-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`

## Previous Work

Recent commits show standardization of string quotes and improvements to logging consistency in hooks.
