# Memory Extraction Process

The memory extraction process involves condensing transcripts into structured memories with specific fields.

## Structured Memory Format

Each extracted memory has:
- `subject`: Brief one-line description of the memory
- `keywords`: Array of searchable keywords (lowercase, specific to the content)
- `applies_to`: Scope indicator - `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`
- `content`: Detailed memory content in markdown format

## Extraction Guidelines

- Extract architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Include bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Document code patterns specific to the project
- Note configuration quirks or gotchas
- Record user preferences discovered during sessions
- Document important relationships between components

## What NOT to Extract

- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly
