Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system that allows Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions. It consists of three main components:

1. **Claude Code Plugin** - Runs hooks on SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, and Stop events to inject relevant memories
2. **MCP Server** - Exposes memory tools for any MCP-compatible client
3. **Memory Storage** - Markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` with YAML frontmatter

Memories are version-controlled and shareable among team members.
