The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku (`claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`) model for semantic understanding of condensed transcripts. The extraction prompt is structured to identify and extract valuable memories while filtering out generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and sensitive data. This approach balances accuracy with cost-efficiency for processing session transcripts asynchronously.
