# Transcript File Format

Claude Code stores transcripts as JSONL files (JSON Lines format - one JSON object per line, separated by newlines).

## Structure

Each line is a complete JSON object representing an event or message in the transcript. The exact structure depends on the event type but typically includes:
- Timestamp information
- Event type (user message, assistant response, etc.)
- Content data

## Reading JSONL Files

When processing transcripts:
1. Read the file line by line
2. Parse each line as separate JSON
3. Don't expect a single JSON array or object - treat each line independently

This format is efficient for append-only transcript logging and allows incremental processing.
