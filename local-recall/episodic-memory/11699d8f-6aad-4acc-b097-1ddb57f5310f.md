The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API client with streaming enabled to process transcripts. This allows for efficient processing of large transcript files by streaming the response rather than waiting for the complete response before processing. The extractor reads transcript files and sends them to Claude for analysis to identify and extract memories.
