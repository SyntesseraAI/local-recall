# Memory Extraction Analysis Framework

When extracting memories from session transcripts, use this structured questioning approach:

## Key Questions

1. **What was learned?** - New knowledge or insights gained during this session
2. **What is now known?** - Important facts about the codebase, architecture, or conventions
3. **What is specific to this codebase?** - Unique patterns, configurations, or quirks discovered
4. **What problems were solved?** - Bugs fixed, issues resolved, and how they were solved

## Memory Quality Guidelines

- **Be specific**: Include file paths, function names, and concrete details
- **Be concise**: Each memory should focus on one concept or discovery
- **Be actionable**: Memories should help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently
- **Use appropriate scope**:
  - `global` - Applies to the entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
  - `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file
  - `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area

## What NOT to Extract

Skip extracting:
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly
