When extracting memories from transcripts, ensure each memory includes proper metadata:
- `occurred_at`: ISO-8601 timestamp of when the event occurred (used for deduplication and sorting)
- `content_hash`: SHA-256 hash prefix of memory content (used to detect duplicate memories)
- `applies_to`: Scope indicator (global, file:<path>, or area:<name>)
- `keywords`: Array of searchable keywords for indexing

This metadata is essential for the memory system's deduplication mechanism and search functionality.
