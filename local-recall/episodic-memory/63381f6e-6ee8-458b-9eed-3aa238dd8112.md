Memory files are structured markdown documents with YAML frontmatter containing metadata. Each memory has an `applies_to` field that defines its scope: `global` (entire codebase), `file:<path>` (specific file), or `area:<name>` (component/area). This scope-based system allows memories to be filtered and retrieved based on the current context, making them more relevant and actionable for specific file or area-based work.
