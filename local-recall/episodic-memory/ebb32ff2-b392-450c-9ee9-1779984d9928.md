Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files stored locally in the repository. The system includes:

- **Core Components**: Memory manager for CRUD operations, vector store with SQLite + embeddings for semantic search, embedding service using fastembed (BGE-small-en-v1.5 model)
- **Memory Format**: YAML frontmatter with markdown content, including fields like id, subject, keywords, applies_to scope, occurred_at timestamp, content_hash
- **Integration**: Claude Code hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop) and MCP server that exposes memory tools
- **Background Processing**: MCP server daemon processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes to extract and create memories
