# Transcript Parsing for Memory Extraction

The memory extraction pipeline uses `claude -p` (with haiku model by default) to intelligently parse session transcripts and extract meaningful memories.

## Process

1. Raw transcript JSONL is read from Claude's cache
2. Transcript is condensed into a human-readable format with events
3. Condensed transcript is piped to `claude -p` as a custom prompt
4. Claude analyzes the transcript and returns extracted memories as JSON
5. Memories are created in the local-recall system

## Implementation Details

- The model is configurable but defaults to haiku for efficiency
- Haiku is sufficient for transcript analysis tasks
- Model can be overridden via `--model` flag to claude command
- Process is idempotent - same transcript produces same memories
