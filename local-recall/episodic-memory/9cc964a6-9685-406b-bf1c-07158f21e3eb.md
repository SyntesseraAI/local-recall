# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes and a UUID suffix.

**Example:**
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcripts stored in: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u/transcripts/`
- Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files

## Key Implementation Details

1. The path conversion is done by replacing forward slashes with dashes
2. The UUID suffix appears to be generated during project initialization
3. Each transcript is a separate `.jsonl` file in the transcripts directory
4. This structure allows Claude Code to maintain separate transcript histories for different projects

## Relevance to Local Recall

The MCP server daemon needs to sync transcripts from this location every 5 minutes to extract memories. Understanding this path format is crucial for the `transcript-collector.ts` component which reads and processes these files.
