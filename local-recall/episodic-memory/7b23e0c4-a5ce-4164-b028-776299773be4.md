The MCP server runs a background daemon that processes Claude Code transcripts every 5 minutes. This daemon:
- Syncs transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
- Uses `claude -p` (piped mode) to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change

This is why the Stop hook is disabled - memory extraction happens asynchronously via the daemon instead.
