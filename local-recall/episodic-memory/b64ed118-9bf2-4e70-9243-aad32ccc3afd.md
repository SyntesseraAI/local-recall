The `analyzeForMemories` function only saves thinking memories when:
1. Content is **multi-line** (contains newlines)
2. Thinking is present and extracted

This is intentional - single-line responses typically don't represent meaningful reasoning worth capturing. This reduces noise in thinking memories while keeping valuable reasoning patterns.
