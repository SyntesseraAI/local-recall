The local-recall/transcripts directory contains 39,879 JSONL transcript files. Of these:
- 51 files contain thinking blocks (claude-opus-4-5-20251101 model with thinkingMetadata)
- 1,101 total thinking blocks across all transcripts
- 12,594 synthetic files (model: "<synthetic>") generated during memory extraction
- 27,285 real user transcripts to process

Thinking blocks can be identified by:
1. Model: "claude-opus-4-5-20251101"
2. thinkingMetadata: {"level":"high","disabled":false,"triggers":[]}
3. Content blocks with type: "thinking" containing thinking and signature fields

Synthetic files should be excluded from all processing as they are internal memory extraction artifacts.
