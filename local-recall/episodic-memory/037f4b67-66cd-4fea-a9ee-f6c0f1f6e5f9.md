The SessionStart hook performs a full reload of all memories on each session start, not a delta/incremental load. In `src/hooks/session-start.ts`, it creates a fresh MemoryManager instance, calls `listMemories()` to get all memories, then selects the 5 most recent by `occurred_at` for context injection. This means every session incurs the cost of loading the entire memory store, though only the top 5 are actually injected.
