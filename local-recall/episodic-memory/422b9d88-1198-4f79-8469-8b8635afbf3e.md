The vector store is implemented with better-sqlite3 and sqlite-vec extension. It uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for generating embeddings. Search results use cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0-1.0 range, rounded to 2 decimals). When similarity scores are equal, results are tie-broken by recency (occurred_at). The embedding model is cached in local_cache/ directory.
