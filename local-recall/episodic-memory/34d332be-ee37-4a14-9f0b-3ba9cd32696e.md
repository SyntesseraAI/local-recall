# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript File Organization

Within each project folder, transcripts are organized by session:
- File pattern: `transcripts/{session-id}.jsonl`
- Format: JSONL (one JSON object per line)
- Each line contains a transcript event with metadata

## Accessing Transcripts Programmatically

For transcript collection and analysis:
1. Get the project folder using path transformation: `path.replace(/\//g, '-')`
2. Read JSONL files from the `transcripts/` subdirectory
3. Parse each line as a separate JSON object
4. Each event contains timing, content, and other metadata useful for memory extraction

This is critical for the transcript-collector component which needs to sync transcripts for memory extraction.
