Transcripts are condensed before memory extraction to reduce token usage and improve response quality. This process removes redundant information while preserving important context about what was accomplished during the session. The condensed format includes: [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], and [Result: OK/ERROR] markers to summarize session events concisely.
