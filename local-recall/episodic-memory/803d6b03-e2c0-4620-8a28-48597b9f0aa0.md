The memory extraction system prevents duplicate memories by checking the content hash and occurred_at timestamp before creating new memories. The findDuplicate function in the memory manager is used to detect if a memory with the same content_hash and occurred_at already exists. If a duplicate is found, the extraction process returns early without creating a new memory.
