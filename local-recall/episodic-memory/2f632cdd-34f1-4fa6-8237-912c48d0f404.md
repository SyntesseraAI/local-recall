The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku API to process transcripts and extract valuable memories. It implements a `MemoryExtractor` class with methods:

- `extractMemories(transcript)` - Main method that sends transcript to Claude Haiku with a system prompt
- Uses `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` for the extraction system prompt
- Parses Claude's response to create memory objects with metadata
- Handles transcript condensing before extraction for efficiency

The system prompt guides Claude to identify architectural decisions, bug fixes, learned patterns, and codebase-specific knowledge worth preserving.
