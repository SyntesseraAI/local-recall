# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`
- Transcripts stored in: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with `.jsonl` extension, where each line is a JSON event representing a turn in the conversation.

## Discovery Context

This was discovered while implementing the transcript collector feature in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`. The path conversion logic is critical for correctly locating and reading transcripts from Claude's internal storage.

## Implications

Future implementations that need to access Claude transcripts must:
1. Convert the working directory path by replacing all forward slashes with dashes
2. Look in `~/.claude/projects/` directory
3. Read `.jsonl` files from the `transcripts/` subdirectory
4. Parse each line as a separate JSON object
