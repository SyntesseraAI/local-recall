The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude's API with streaming (`useStreaming: true`) to process transcripts efficiently. The system reads condensed transcripts and extracts memories using a structured prompt defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This approach reduces token consumption compared to processing full transcripts.
