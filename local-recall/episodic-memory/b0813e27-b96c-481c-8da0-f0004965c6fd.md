The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001) for analyzing session transcripts and condensing them into structured memory format. This is documented in src/core/memory-extractor.ts and provides an efficient way to extract memories from raw transcript data without needing the full Sonnet model.
