Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search capabilities. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first run (takes 30-60 seconds) and cached for subsequent runs. If the cache becomes corrupted, removing `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` allows the model to re-download automatically.
