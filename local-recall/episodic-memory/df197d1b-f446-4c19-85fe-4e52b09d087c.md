The TranscriptCollector reads transcripts from Claude's project cache:

**Path**: `~/.claude/projects/<project-id>/transcripts/`

**Process**:
1. Scans transcript directory for new/modified files
2. Reads raw transcript JSON files
3. Computes content hash for change detection
4. Only processes changed transcripts (checked against `processed-log.jsonl`)

**Important**: Project ID is derived from the project root directory path. Different projects have separate transcript directories, so the MCP server must know which project it's running in.

**Environment variable**: `LOCAL_RECALL_DIR` points to memory storage directory (e.g., `./local-recall`), which is typically a sibling or subdirectory of the project root.
