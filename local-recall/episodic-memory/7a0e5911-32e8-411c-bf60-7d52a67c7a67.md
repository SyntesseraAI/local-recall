Claude Code stores transcript files in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The project folder name is the working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes (e.g., `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`). Each transcript is stored as a JSONL file (`transcript.jsonl`) containing individual message objects with event type, content, and metadata.
