Memory extraction from transcripts should follow these guidelines:

**Memory Format:**
- Each memory focuses on one concept or discovery
- Include file paths, function names, and concrete details
- Keep memories specific and actionable

**Scope Categories:**
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to particular file
- `area:<name>` - Related to component or area

**What to Extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**What NOT to Extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Outdated information
