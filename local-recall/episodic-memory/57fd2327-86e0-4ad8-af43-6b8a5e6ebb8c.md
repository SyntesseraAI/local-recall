The transcript condensing step is critical for efficient memory extraction. It converts raw user-assistant dialogue into structured event format:

- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses or explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations with names
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool execution outcomes

This preprocessing standardizes transcript format before the memory extraction LLM processes it, reducing token usage and improving extraction quality.
