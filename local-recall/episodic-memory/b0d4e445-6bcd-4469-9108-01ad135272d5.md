When deploying plugin updates, existing Claude instances will continue using the cached version from `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` even if the plugin source has been fixed. Users must manually uninstall (`/plugins uninstall local-recall`) and reinstall the plugin to get the updated version. This is particularly important when bug fixes affect the bundled server.js or other plugin components.
