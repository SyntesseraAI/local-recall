Local Recall implements semantic search using the fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model. The vector-store.ts and embedding.ts modules handle embedding generation and similarity search. This provides better matching than keyword-only search, finding conceptually related memories even if keywords don't match exactly.
