Memory subjects are now generated by:
1. Check if text contains newlines (multiline)
2. If multiline: extract first line only
3. If single-line: extract text up to first `.!?` or all text if no punctuation

This provides meaningful, concise subject lines for both thinking and answer memories, regardless of input format.
