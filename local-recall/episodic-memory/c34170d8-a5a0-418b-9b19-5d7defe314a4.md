Potential next work items for Local Recall:
1. Build CLI with init, search, list, create commands
2. Memory deduplication to detect and merge similar memories
3. Memory decay/pruning to automatically archive stale memories
4. Smarter retrieval based on current files in context
5. Improve stop hook analysis for better automatic memory extraction
6. Live testing by installing the plugin in a real project

These represent the natural next steps after the core foundation is complete.
