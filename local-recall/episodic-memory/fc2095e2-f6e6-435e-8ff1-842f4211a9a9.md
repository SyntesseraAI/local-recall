The memory extraction system uses transcript condensing before sending transcripts to Claude for analysis. This reduces the amount of raw transcript data that needs to be processed, improving efficiency and reducing token usage. The condensed format uses event markers like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]` to represent the session activity in a compact format.
