# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/{project-folder}/transcripts/`
- Each transcript file is named with a timestamp prefix

## Transcript Structure

Transcripts are stored in JSONL format (one JSON object per line), making them suitable for streaming parsing and analysis.
