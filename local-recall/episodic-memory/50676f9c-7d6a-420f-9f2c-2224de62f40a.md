# Embedding Model First-Run Behavior

The Local Recall project uses the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model via fastembed library. The model file (~133MB) is downloaded and cached to `local_cache/` on first use.

- First startup: 30-60 seconds for model download
- Subsequent runs: Load from local cache (fast)
- Cache location: `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`
- Common issue: Interrupted downloads leave corrupted cache files

When cache is corrupted, users see: "Tokenizer file not found at local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json"

Solution: Remove entire `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` directory to force re-download.
