Memory extraction prompts define how Claude should structure extracted memories with required fields: subject (one-line description), keywords (array for searchability), applies_to (scope), and content (detailed markdown). The prompt teaches Claude the memory format and extraction guidelines to ensure consistent, high-quality memory extraction from transcripts.
