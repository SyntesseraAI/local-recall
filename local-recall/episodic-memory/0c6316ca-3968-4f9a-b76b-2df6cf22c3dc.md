The Claude Haiku prompt for memory extraction is stored separately in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts to keep the extraction logic maintainable and the prompt text editable without recompiling. This prompt should instruct Claude on how to parse transcript events and identify valuable memories, extracting specific keywords and applying appropriate scope (global, file, or area).
