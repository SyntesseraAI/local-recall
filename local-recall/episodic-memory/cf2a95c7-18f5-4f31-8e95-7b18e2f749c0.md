The MemoryExtractor class in src/core/memory-extractor.ts uses the Claude API (specifically claude-opus-4-1 model) to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. It calls the extractMemoriesFromTranscript method which sends the transcript and a system prompt to Claude for analysis. The response is parsed as JSON to extract memory objects with subject, keywords, applies_to, and content fields.
