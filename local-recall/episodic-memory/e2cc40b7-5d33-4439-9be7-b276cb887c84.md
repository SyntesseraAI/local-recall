When extracting memories from transcripts, focus on:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

DO NOT extract generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, sensitive data, or outdated information.
