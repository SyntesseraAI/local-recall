# Path Conversion for Transcript Collection

When implementing transcript collection, the collector needs to convert absolute file paths to match Claude's project folder naming convention.

## Conversion Logic

Absolute path to folder name conversion:
1. Take the absolute path (e.g., `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`)
2. Replace slashes with dashes: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
3. Remove colons (Windows drive letters like `C:` become `C`)
4. This produces the folder name where Claude stores transcripts

## Implementation Details

- The conversion function should be reusable and well-tested
- Consider caching results if called frequently
- Needs to work cross-platform (different path separators on Windows vs Unix)
- The transcript-collector.ts should use this conversion to locate the correct project folder

## Why This Matters

Accurate path conversion is essential because:
- Different projects have different transcript locations
- The collector needs to read from the correct folder
- Errors in conversion would read transcripts from the wrong project
