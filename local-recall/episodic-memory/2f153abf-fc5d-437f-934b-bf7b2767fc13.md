When extracting memories, focus on: architectural decisions and reasoning, bug fixes with root cause analysis, project-specific code patterns and conventions, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, and performance optimizations. Avoid: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious/trivial info, sensitive data, and information that becomes outdated quickly.
