The memory extraction logic uses a centralized prompt file (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) that provides Claude with detailed instructions for analyzing transcripts and extracting memories. This prompt defines what should be extracted (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, user preferences) and what should be ignored (generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, trivial information). The prompt ensures consistency across all memory extraction operations and makes it easy to refine the extraction process by updating a single file.
