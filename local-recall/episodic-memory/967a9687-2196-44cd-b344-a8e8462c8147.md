The local-recall system uses transcript condensing to reduce token usage when extracting memories. This is evident from the existence of `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` which handles condensing transcripts into events (User prompts, Assistant responses, Tool calls, Results) before passing them to Claude for memory extraction. This optimization is important for keeping API costs reasonable while still capturing valuable context.
