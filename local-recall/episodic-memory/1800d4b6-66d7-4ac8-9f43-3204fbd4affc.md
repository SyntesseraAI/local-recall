The `memory-extractor.ts` file (478 lines) contains the core logic for extracting memories from session transcripts. It uses Claude Haiku to analyze condensed transcripts and generate structured memories with proper metadata (subject, keywords, applies_to scope, content). This is part of the background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously.
