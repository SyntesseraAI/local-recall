Memory extraction instructions are maintained in a separate `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` file rather than inline in the memory-extractor module. This separation allows for:

- Easy prompt iteration and improvement without touching extraction logic
- Clear documentation of extraction guidelines
- Reusability across different extraction contexts
- Version control and review of prompt changes independently
