The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API (claude-3-5-sonnet model) to semantically analyze transcripts and extract meaningful memories. Rather than simple keyword extraction, it sends the transcript through a carefully structured prompt (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) that instructs Claude to identify what was learned, important discoveries, architectural decisions, and bug fixes. This ensures extracted memories are contextually relevant and actionable for future sessions.
