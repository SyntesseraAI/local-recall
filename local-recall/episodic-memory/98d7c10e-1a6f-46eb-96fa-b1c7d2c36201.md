Testing confirmed that Claude Haiku can successfully handle the memory extraction workload. It correctly extracts structured memories from transcripts with proper JSON formatting and valid memory structure. Haiku is recommended for production memory extraction due to its ~20x cost reduction compared to Sonnet while maintaining extraction quality. The model change is implemented in src/core/memory-extractor.ts:80-81.
