Updated `analyzeForMemories` function to handle thinking differently from answers:
- Saves **all thinking** as memories (even single-line), using first sentence as subject
- Saves **only multiline answers** (content with 2+ lines) as memory content
This provides a richer memory record while filtering out verbose single-line responses.
