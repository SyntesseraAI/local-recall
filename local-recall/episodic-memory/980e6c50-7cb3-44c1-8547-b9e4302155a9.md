The memory extractor uses Claude Haiku API via `claude -p` command to analyze transcripts. It condenses transcripts using a specific prompt structure defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts. The extractor reads transcript files, sends them to Claude for analysis, and receives extracted memories in JSON format with proper frontmatter structure.
