The Stop hook is disabled. Instead, the MCP server runs a background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. This daemon syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, extracts memories using the memory extractor, and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection. This asynchronous approach is more reliable than synchronous hook-based processing.
