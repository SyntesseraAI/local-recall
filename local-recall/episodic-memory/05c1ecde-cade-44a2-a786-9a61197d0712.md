# Claude Transcript Storage Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` directory on macOS.

## Path Naming Convention

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Slashes (`/`) are replaced with hyphens (`-`)
- The path is prefixed with a unique identifier
- Format: `{identifier}-{path-with-hyphens}`

Example: For project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`, the transcript location would be something like `~/.claude/projects/{id}-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files, where each line is a JSON object representing a single message or interaction in the session.

## Relevance to Local Recall

This is crucial for the transcript-collector component which needs to locate and process Claude's transcript files to extract memories for the local-recall system.
