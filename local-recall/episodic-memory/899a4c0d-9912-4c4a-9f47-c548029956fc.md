The memory extraction prompt (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) explicitly guides the LLM on:

1. What to extract (learned knowledge, discoveries, solved problems, architectural decisions)
2. What NOT to extract (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, outdated information)
3. Appropriate scope selection (global vs file-specific vs area-specific)
4. Output format (JSON with subject, keywords, applies_to, content)

The prompt follows a "Guidelines for Memory Extraction" framework that helps the LLM produce high-quality, actionable memories rather than raw notes about the session.
