Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system with the following implemented components:

**Core Systems:**
- Memory CRUD operations (memory.ts)
- Index management (index.ts)
- Fuzzy search using Fuse.js (search.ts)
- MCP Server with 6 exposed tools
- Session-start hook that loads relevant memories
- Stop hook that auto-extracts memories from transcripts
- Keyword extraction for memory indexing

**Architecture:**
- Memories stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- Uses Orama vector store for semantic search
- Ollama integration for embeddings (nomic-embed-text model, 768 dimensions)
- Background daemon processes transcripts every 5 minutes
- Two memory types: episodic and thinking memories

**Key Features:**
- Version-controlled memory files
- Idempotent memory creation (deduplication via content hash)
- Semantic search with similarity scoring
- Configurable token budgets and similarity thresholds
- Thinking memory format: captures reasoning paired with output
