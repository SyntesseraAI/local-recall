# Memory Extraction from Transcripts

The local-recall system is designed to extract valuable insights and knowledge from Claude Code session transcripts and store them as persistent memories.

## Key Principles

1. **Be specific**: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
2. **Be concise**: Focus on one concept or discovery per memory
3. **Be actionable**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently
4. **Appropriate scope**: Use `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`

## What to Extract

- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

## What NOT to Extract

- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly
