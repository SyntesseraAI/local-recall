# Build and Project Structure

## Source Organization
- TypeScript source code is in `src/` directory
- Compiled/bundled JavaScript output goes to `scripts/` directory
- The `scripts/` directory is gitignored (auto-generated from builds)

## Build Process
- Run `npm run build` to compile TypeScript
- Run `npm run dev` for watch mode during development
- The build bundles hook scripts and MCP server into executable form
- Build outputs are not version-controlled (they're regenerated on each build)

## Key Files
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `package.json` - npm scripts and dependencies
- Hooks and MCP server source in `src/hooks/` and `src/mcp-server/`
- Built outputs in `scripts/hooks/` and `scripts/mcp-server/`

## Building in CI/CD
Always ensure the project is built before use - hooks and MCP server need the compiled JavaScript from `scripts/` to run.
