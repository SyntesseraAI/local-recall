Memory applies_to field controls scope: 'global' for codebase-wide knowledge, 'file:/path/to/file' for file-specific insights (e.g., architectural decisions in specific modules), 'area:component-name' for component areas (e.g., area:authentication, area:database). This enables targeted context injection - only relevant memories are loaded for current session or prompt.
