# Platform-Specific Path Handling in Transcript Collector

The transcript collector must handle different path formats based on the operating system:

## macOS/Linux
- Home directory path uses forward slashes (`/Users/...`)
- Project folder path converts slashes to dashes
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## Windows
- Home directory path uses backslashes (`C:\Users\...`)
- Drive letter needs special handling (e.g., `C:` becomes something manageable)
- Project folder path likely converts backslashes to dashes similarly

## Implementation Considerations

1. Use `process.platform` or `os.platform()` to detect the operating system
2. Use `path.join()` or similar utilities for cross-platform path construction
3. Normalize paths before transformation (remove leading slashes/drive letters)
4. Test on all supported platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux)
5. Document the exact transformation logic for each platform
