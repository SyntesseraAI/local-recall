# Claude Model Selection Preference

## Haiku for Hook Execution

When invoking Claude via the CLI (`claude -p` command) in hooks, background tasks, or scripts, use the **Haiku** model for speed and cost efficiency.

## Context

The user stated that when calling `claude -p --model haiku` for operations like:
- Keyword extraction from prompts
- Transcript analysis and memory extraction
- Other quick processing tasks in the background daemon

They prefer Haiku for its speed, as these are synchronous/time-sensitive operations that block the hook execution.

## Implementation Note

Ensure that any new code invoking Claude in the UserPromptSubmit hook or MCP server background tasks uses `--model haiku` to match this preference.
