# Memory Extraction Keyword Strategy

When extracting memories from transcripts, keyword accuracy is critical for downstream search and retrieval.

## Challenge

The user's request to "extract keywords from this text" is ambiguous - it could mean:
1. Only high-value semantic keywords (for memory search optimization)
2. All keywords/terms mentioned in the text
3. Specific domain keywords relevant to the project

## Recommendation

When extracting keywords for memories:
- Focus on **semantic relevance** - keywords that help future assistants find this memory
- Prioritize terms that are specific to the domain or project
- Include both exact terms and related concepts
- Avoid redundant or overly generic keywords

The quality of keywords directly impacts the effectiveness of the fuzzy search feature.
