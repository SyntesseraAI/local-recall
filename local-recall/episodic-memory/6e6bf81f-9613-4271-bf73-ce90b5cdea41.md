Local Recall has several core components in `src/core/`:
- `memory.ts`: CRUD operations for memory files (no update - memories are idempotent)
- `vector-store.ts`: SQLite-backed vector store using better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for semantic search
- `embedding.ts`: Embedding service using fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model
- `search.ts`: Semantic search using vector embeddings
- `transcript-collector.ts`: Collects transcripts from Claude cache
- `transcript-condenser.ts`: Condenses transcripts for processing
- `memory-extractor.ts`: Extracts memories from transcripts
- `processed-log.ts`: Tracks processed transcripts
