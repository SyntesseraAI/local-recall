The vector store (`src/core/vector-store.ts`) is built on SQLite using the `better-sqlite3` library with the `sqlite-vec` extension. It uses the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) from fastembed for semantic search. The model is cached in `local_cache/` after first download. Search results use cosine distance similarity (0.0-1.0 score) and recency tie-breaking when scores are equal.
