# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Project: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Directory: `~/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory, one file per session with timestamp-based names.
