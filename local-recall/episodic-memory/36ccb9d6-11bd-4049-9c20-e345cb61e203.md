The IndexManager has an `ensureGitignore()` method that creates a .gitignore file in the local-recall directory to ignore index.json and recall.log. This method is called from `getIndex()` which is invoked during every session start via the session-start hook. The method also ensures the local-recall base directory exists before creating the .gitignore file, making it safe to call on fresh projects with no existing local-recall folder. This ensures .gitignore is always present and up-to-date without requiring manual setup.
