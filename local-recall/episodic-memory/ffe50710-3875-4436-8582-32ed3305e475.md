# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

When processing Claude Code session transcripts (stored as JSONL), it's helpful to condense them into structured events before memory extraction:

## Event Types

- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations with parameters
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool calls

## Benefits

- **Reduces noise**: Filters out formatting, metadata, and unimportant details
- **Improves signal**: Focuses on meaningful interactions and decisions
- **Enables analysis**: Makes it easier to identify patterns and extract memories
- **Maintains context**: Preserves the flow and relationships between events

This technique helps AI assistants understand what happened during a session without being overwhelmed by low-level details.
