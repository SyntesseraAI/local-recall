Valuable memories to extract include:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

Do NOT extract generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, or sensitive data.
