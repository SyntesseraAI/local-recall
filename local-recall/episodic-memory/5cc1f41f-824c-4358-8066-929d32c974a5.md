# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The project implements transcript condensing as a preprocessing step before memory extraction.

## Purpose

Raw Claude Code transcripts are verbose and contain redundant tool invocations. Condensing reduces noise and focuses on meaningful interactions that should become memories.

## Implementation Status

A commit `8c4fbf5` indicates "feat: implement transcript condensing for memory extraction" has been implemented.

## Process

1. Raw transcript is read from Claude's cache
2. Transcript is condensed to remove noise and redundancy
3. Condensed version is passed to memory extraction logic
4. This improves the quality and relevance of extracted memories

- `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` - Handles transcript collection and processing
- Likely uses Claude Haiku for summarization/condensing via `claude -p` command
