# Memory Extraction Task Definition

## Core Responsibility
Analyze Claude Code session transcripts to extract valuable memories that help future AI assistants understand the codebase.

## What to Extract

### DO Extract:
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

### DO NOT Extract:
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps that aren't useful long-term
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that would become outdated quickly

## Memory Format Requirements

Each memory must have:
- `subject`: Brief one-line description (max 200 chars)
- `keywords`: Array of 1-10 searchable keywords (lowercase, specific)
- `applies_to`: Scope - `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`
- `content`: Detailed memory content in markdown format

## Scope Guidelines

- **global**: Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- **file:<path>**: Specific to particular file
- **area:<name>**: Related to component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`)
