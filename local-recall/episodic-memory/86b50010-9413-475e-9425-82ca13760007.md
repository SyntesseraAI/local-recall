Local Recall is a comprehensive memory management system that allows Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions. It stores memories as structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter in a version-controlled repository. The system includes vector embeddings for semantic search, SQLite backend for persistence, and MCP server integration for tool exposure.
