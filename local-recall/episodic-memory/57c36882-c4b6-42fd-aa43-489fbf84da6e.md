Local Recall uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. Model automatically downloads to `local_cache/` on first use (takes 30-60 seconds). Subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file not found error occurs, delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to reset and re-download.
