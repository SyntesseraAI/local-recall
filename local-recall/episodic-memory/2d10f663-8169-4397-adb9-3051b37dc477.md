Memory extraction should follow these principles:

**DO Extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT Extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

**Scope Guidelines:**
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a file
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component/area

Memories must be specific, concise, and actionable.
