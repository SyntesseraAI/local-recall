The BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model is automatically downloaded to local_cache/ on first use. First startup may take 30-60 seconds while downloading (~133MB). Subsequent runs load from cache. If 'Tokenizer file not found' error occurs, the cache is corrupted - delete local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5* and the model will re-download on next run.
