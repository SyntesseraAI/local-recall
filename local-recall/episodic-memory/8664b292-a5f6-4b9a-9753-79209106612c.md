The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to convert transcripts into structured memory files. The extraction prompt is defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and guides the model to generate memories with proper YAML frontmatter (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash) and markdown content. This is the core mechanism for turning session transcripts into persistent memories.
