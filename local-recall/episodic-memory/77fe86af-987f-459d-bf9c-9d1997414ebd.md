Added recency weighting to search scoring in both `VectorStore` and `ThinkingVectorStore`. Formula: `adjustedScore = similarity * (1 + 0.1 * recencyFactor)` where `recencyFactor` ranges from 0.0 (oldest memory) to 1.0 (newest memory). This gives recent memories up to 10% score boost as a tie-breaker when similarity is equal, improving relevance for recent context.
