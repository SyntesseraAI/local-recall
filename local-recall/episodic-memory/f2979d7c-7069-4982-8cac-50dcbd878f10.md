# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with names like:
- `2025-12-01T12-34-56-789Z.jsonl` (ISO-8601 timestamp with milliseconds, T and colons replaced with dashes)

## Content Structure

Each line in the JSONL file is a JSON object representing a transcript event with fields like:
- `timestamp` - When the event occurred
- `role` - Either "user" or "assistant"
- `content` - The message or action content
- Other metadata fields depending on event type

This path format makes it easy to locate transcripts for any project based on its absolute path.
