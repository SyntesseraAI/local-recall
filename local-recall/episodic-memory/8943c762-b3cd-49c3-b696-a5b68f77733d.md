# Memory Files in Version Control

Unlike the index and logs, memory files are intentionally version-controlled artifacts:

## Version Control Strategy
- Memory files (`local-recall/episodic-memory/*.md`) are **tracked in Git**
- Index files (`local-recall/index.json`) are **gitignored**
- Debug logs (`local-recall/recall.log`) are **gitignored**

## Why Track Memory Files
- Enables sharing of discovered knowledge among team members
- Creates a persistent, auditable record of important findings
- Allows reviewing memory decisions in Git history
- Team-wide access to architectural decisions and bug fix context

## Important for AI Assistants
- Always commit new memories using the Memory Manager
- Memory creation is idempotent (won't create duplicates)
- Use `file:` scope for file-specific memories
- Use `area:` scope for component-related insights
- Include specific keywords for better discoverability
