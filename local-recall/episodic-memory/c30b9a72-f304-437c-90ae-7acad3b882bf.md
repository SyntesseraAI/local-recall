# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes.

### Example

For working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`:
- Folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files with `.jsonl` extension:
- One JSON object per line
- Each line represents an event (user message, assistant response, tool call, etc.)
- Files are named chronologically (e.g., `2024-12-01.jsonl`)

## Key Fields in Transcript Events

- `type`: Event type ("user_message", "assistant_message", "tool_call", "tool_result", etc.)
- `timestamp`: ISO-8601 timestamp of when the event occurred
- `content`: The actual message or data for the event
- `tool_name`: For tool events, the name of the tool invoked

This structure is important for transcript-based memory extraction systems that need to process Claude's session history.
