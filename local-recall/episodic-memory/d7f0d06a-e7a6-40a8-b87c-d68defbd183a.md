Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. Key points:
- Model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use
- First run may take 30-60 seconds for model download
- Subsequent runs load from cache
- If cache gets corrupted, remove `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to force re-download
