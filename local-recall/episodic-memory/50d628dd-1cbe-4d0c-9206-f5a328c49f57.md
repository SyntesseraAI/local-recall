The memory extraction system prompt is maintained in a separate `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` file rather than inline in the extractor. This allows the prompt to be versioned independently, reused across multiple extraction contexts, and updated without modifying the core extraction logic. This is a best practice for prompt management in production systems.
