The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses `claude-haiku` model for transcript analysis. This is a deliberate choice for cost and performance efficiency when processing transcripts to extract structured memories. The extractor parses transcripts and uses Claude's API to identify and create memory records from session content.
