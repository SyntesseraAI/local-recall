The local-recall project does not currently have a GitHub MCP server configured. To access GitHub PR comments, issues, or other GitHub data from Claude Code, a GitHub MCP server needs to be installed and configured in `.claude/settings.json`. This would allow tools to fetch PR information, review comments, and other GitHub metadata.
