All new features must have corresponding unit tests in `tests/unit/` and integration tests in `tests/integration/`. Documentation must be placed in `docs/` folder. Update existing docs when modifying functionality. Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases. Use `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, and `npm test` for development.
