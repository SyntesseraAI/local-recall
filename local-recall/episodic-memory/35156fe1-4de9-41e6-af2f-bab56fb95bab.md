The `findDuplicate` method in `src/core/memory.ts` checks for existing memories by comparing `occurred_at` timestamp and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix). This prevents creating duplicate memories when the same event is processed multiple times. The `createMemory` method returns the existing memory if a duplicate is detected rather than creating a new one.
