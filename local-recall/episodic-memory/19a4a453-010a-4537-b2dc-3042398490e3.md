The Orama vector store returns search results with cosine similarity scores (0.0-1.0 range, rounded to 2 decimals). Results are sorted by score descending, but when scores are equal, more recent memories (by `occurred_at` timestamp) should be ranked first. This recency tie-breaker ensures that in cases of equal relevance, the most recent context takes precedence.
