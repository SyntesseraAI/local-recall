The local-recall system extracts memories from Claude Code session transcripts by analyzing what was learned, discovered, and solved. The extraction process uses Claude Haiku to process condensed transcripts and generate structured memory objects with subject, keywords, scope, and detailed content.

Key aspects:
- Analyzes events in format: [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], [Result: OK/ERROR]
- Extracts memories for architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and user preferences
- Uses appropriate scopes: global (codebase-wide), file:<path> (file-specific), area:<name> (component-specific)
- Excludes generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and trivial information
- Memory objects include unique ID, subject, keywords, scope, timestamp, and content hash for deduplication
