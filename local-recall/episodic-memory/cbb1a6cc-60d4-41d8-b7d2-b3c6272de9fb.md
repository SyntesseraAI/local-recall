The memory extraction process in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 model) with carefully crafted prompts from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. The extractor takes condensed transcripts and extracts structured memories with metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash). The process handles transcript parsing, deduplication via content hashes, and validates extracted memories against a schema.
