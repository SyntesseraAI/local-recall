# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) containing:
- User messages
- Assistant responses
- Tool invocations and results
- Session metadata

This information is useful for memory extraction and transcript analysis systems that need to locate and process project transcripts programmatically.
