Local Recall uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use. First startup may take 30-60 seconds for download; subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file error occurs, delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and model will re-download.
