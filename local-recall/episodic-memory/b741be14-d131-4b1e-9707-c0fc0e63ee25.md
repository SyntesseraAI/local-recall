# Memory Extraction Transcript Format

When extracting memories from transcripts, the input is a condensed format with events:

- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool invocations

This condensed format is provided to the memory extraction process rather than raw JSONL transcripts, making it easier to analyze and extract relevant memories.

## Scope

This format is used by the memory extraction hook/daemon when analyzing sessions to create meaningful memories.
