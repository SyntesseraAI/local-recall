The memory storage folder was renamed from 'memories' to 'episodic-memory' to better clarify its purpose. This change was applied across:

- `src/core/memory.ts:34` - Updated folder path definition
- `src/core/index.ts:30` - Updated folder path definition
- `tests/unit/core/memory.test.ts:54` - Updated test expectations
- Documentation files (CLAUDE.md, docs/mcp-server.md, docs/architecture.md)

The renaming distinguishes episodic memories from thinking memories, which are stored in the `thinking-memory` folder. Both folders are tracked in git.
