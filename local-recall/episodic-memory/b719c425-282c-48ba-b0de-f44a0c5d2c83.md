# Transcript Event Structure

Claude Code transcripts store events as JSONL (JSON Lines), with each line containing a complete event object.

## Event Types

Transcripts contain various event types:
- `message` events - User messages and Assistant responses
- `tool` events - Tool invocations and results
- Other metadata events

## Event Properties

Each event object contains:
- `type` - The event type identifier
- `id` - Unique event identifier
- `timestamp` or similar time tracking
- Type-specific properties (role, content for messages, tool name/input/output for tool events)

## Relevance

Understanding the transcript structure is essential for the transcript-collector to:
1. Parse transcript files correctly
2. Extract meaningful events for memory extraction
3. Condense transcripts into a analyzable format
4. Track which transcripts have been processed
