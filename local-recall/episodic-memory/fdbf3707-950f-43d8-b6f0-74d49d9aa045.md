The memory extraction system uses Claude API (via claude-sdk) to analyze transcripts and extract memories. A key optimization is transcript condensing - transcripts are condensed into a compact event format before sending to Claude to reduce token usage. This is handled by the `condenseTranscript()` function which converts full transcripts into a structured format of user requests, assistant responses, and tool invocations.
