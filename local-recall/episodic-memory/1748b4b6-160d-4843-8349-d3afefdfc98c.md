The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API (claude-3-5-haiku) to intelligently parse session transcripts and extract actionable memories. It uses a structured prompt system from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to generate memories with proper YAML frontmatter, keywords, and content. The extraction process is designed to identify valuable insights, architectural decisions, and code patterns from transcripts that will help future AI assistants.
