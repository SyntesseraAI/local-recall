When testing hooks, the memories exist in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` as markdown files. The session-start hook reads these files directly and sorts them by `occurred_at` field. The index file (`orama-episodic-index.json`) may be empty or missing during initial setup, but the hook still functions by reading from the markdown files on disk.
