When syncing transcripts from Claude's cache, synthetic transcripts should be filtered **before** copying to the local transcript directory, not after. This avoids unnecessary I/O operations where files are copied only to be cleaned up on the next pass.

The pattern: check source → skip if synthetic → only copy genuine transcripts → then cleanup any remaining synthetic files as a safety measure.
