Memory files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` are tracked in git and should be committed. The `.gitignore` in `local-recall/` excludes:
- `memory.sqlite`: SQLite database with vector embeddings (auto-generated)
- `recall.log`: Debug log file
- `local_cache/`: Embedding model cache

This design allows memories to be shared between team members via git while keeping generated data and logs local.
