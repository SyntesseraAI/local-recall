The search module provides fuzzy matching against memory keywords. The index is built from all memory files and cached at `local-recall/index.json`. Search uses a configurable fuzzy threshold (default 0.6) to determine relevance. This enables fast retrieval of relevant memories based on user input without requiring semantic embeddings.
