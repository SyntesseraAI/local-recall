The Local Recall project maintains a clean separation between the memory extraction logic (`src/core/memory-extractor.ts`) and the prompts used to guide extraction (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`). This modular approach allows for easy maintenance and iteration on extraction prompts without modifying the extraction engine itself.
