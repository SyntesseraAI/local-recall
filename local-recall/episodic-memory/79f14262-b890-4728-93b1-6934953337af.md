The plugin's `hooks.json` must be kept in sync with the main project's hook implementation. When the main project changes from using `user-prompt-submit-thinking.js` to a unified `user-prompt-submit.js` that handles both episodic and thinking memories, the plugin configuration must be updated to match.

Stale hook files that reference deleted dependencies will cause plugin hook failures. Always verify that bundled hook files exist and use only pure JavaScript libraries before deploying to users.
