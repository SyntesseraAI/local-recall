Claude Code hooks configuration in hooks.json uses:

- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` - Environment variable for plugin installation path
- Hooks receive JSON via stdin with fields: `session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`, and optionally `prompt`
- `cwd` parameter tells hooks the user's project directory
- Hooks can be configured as part of plugin system or directly in .claude/settings.json
- SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks have 30-second timeout
- Stop hook has 60-second timeout (though currently disabled in favor of MCP daemon)
