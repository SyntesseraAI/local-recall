Each memory should use the appropriate `applies_to` scope:

- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

Choosing the correct scope ensures memories are associated with the right context and are retrieved when relevant to the current work.
