# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the file path of the project:
- The folder name appears to be a hash or encoding of the full file path
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` maps to a folder with a specific naming pattern
- Transcripts within each project are stored as JSONL files with session IDs

## Accessing Transcripts

To programmatically access Claude transcripts:
1. Expand `~` to the user's home directory
2. Navigate to `.claude/projects/`
3. Find the folder corresponding to your project path
4. Transcript files are in JSONL format (one JSON object per line)
5. Each line typically contains conversation events with timestamps and content

## Implementation Note

When implementing transcript collection, use Node.js `path` module with `homedir()` to construct the path, and parse JSONL files line-by-line rather than loading the entire file at once for better memory efficiency.
