The local-recall system uses a meta-pattern where Claude analyzes session transcripts to extract memories that help future AI assistants. The extraction process focuses on:

- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the codebase
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences and important relationships between components

Memories should be specific and actionable, avoiding generic programming knowledge or temporary debugging steps. Each memory targets a specific scope: global (entire codebase), file-specific, or area-specific.
