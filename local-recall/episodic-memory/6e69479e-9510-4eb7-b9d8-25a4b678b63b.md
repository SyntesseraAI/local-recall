# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts on macOS at `~/.claude/projects/`.

## Directory Naming Convention

Project folders use the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (JSON lines format) with session identifiers:
- File naming pattern: `<session-id>.jsonl`
- Each line contains a complete JSON object representing a transcript event
- Events include user prompts, assistant responses, and tool invocations

This knowledge is critical for the transcript collector to locate and process transcripts from Claude sessions.
