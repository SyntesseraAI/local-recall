The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku as a subprocess to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. The system spawns a Node.js child process that invokes Claude with the `claude -p` command, passing the transcript content and extraction prompt via stdin. This approach allows the MCP server daemon to process transcripts asynchronously without blocking. The extracted memories are then stored as markdown files in the episodic-memory directory.
