The memory extraction system uses a dedicated `MemoryExtractor` class in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` that integrates with Claude API to analyze transcripts and generate memories. The extractor uses prompts defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide Claude in identifying valuable information from session transcripts. This is a key component for the transcript-to-memory pipeline.
