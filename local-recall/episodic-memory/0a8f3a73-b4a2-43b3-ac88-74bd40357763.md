Before sending transcripts to Claude for memory extraction, they are condensed to extract only the most relevant events ([User], [Assistant], [Tool], [Result] entries). This reduces token usage significantly while preserving context needed for memory extraction. The condensed format is more efficient for the Claude API to process.
