The `analyzeForMemories` function deliberately filters out single-line messages from being saved as memories. This is by design to reduce noise in the memory system - single-line responses (like 'Got it' or 'Done') aren't valuable memories.

Tests should be written with multi-line content to properly test memory extraction functionality.
