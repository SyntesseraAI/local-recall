Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcript location: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) where each line is a separate JSON object representing an event in the conversation.
