Claude Desktop stores transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/` directory. Each transcript is stored as a JSONL (JSON Lines) file. On macOS, the home directory path uses tilde (~) expansion. The project folder name is derived from the session UUID or project identifier.

This is relevant for the transcript-collector component which syncs transcripts from this location.
