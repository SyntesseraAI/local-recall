When extracting memories from transcripts, focus on:
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the codebase
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences and conventions
- Component relationships and performance considerations

Avoid extracting generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, or sensitive data.
