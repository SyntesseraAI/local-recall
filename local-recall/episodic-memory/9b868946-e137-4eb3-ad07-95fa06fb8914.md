# MCP Tools Simplified for Immutable Memory Model

## Removed Tools
- `memory_update` - removed as memories are immutable
- `memory_delete` - removed as only users can delete memories manually

## Remaining Tools
- `memory_create` - creates new memories (idempotent, checks for duplicates)
- `memory_list` - lists all memories
- `memory_search` - searches memories by keywords
- `index_rebuild` - rebuilds the memory index

## Implications
The MCP interface is now simpler and only exposes operations that align with the immutable episodic memory model.
