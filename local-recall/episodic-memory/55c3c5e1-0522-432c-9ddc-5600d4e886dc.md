Guidelines for creating memories:
- Keep memories atomic - one concept per memory file
- Use specific, searchable keywords (1-10 per memory)
- Consider scope carefully: global vs file: vs area:
- Memory files ARE version-controlled - they will be committed to git
- SQLite database and vector cache are gitignored and auto-generated
