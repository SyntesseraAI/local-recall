The memory extraction prompt system in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` provides structured guidance to Claude Haiku for extracting valuable memories from transcripts. The prompts:

1. Define what constitutes valuable memories (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, user preferences)
2. Specify the exact memory format required (subject, keywords, applies_to, content)
3. Guide scope selection (global vs file-specific vs area-specific)
4. Emphasize being specific with file paths and function names
5. Exclude generic knowledge and temporary debugging steps

This structured approach ensures consistent, high-quality memory extraction across different sessions.
