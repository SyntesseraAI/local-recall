The memory extractor module (`src/core/memory-extractor.ts`) uses the `claude-api` library to send transcript content to Claude for memory extraction. It processes condensed transcripts and receives back structured memory data with fields like subject, keywords, applies_to, and content. The extraction is driven by a detailed prompt system defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`.
