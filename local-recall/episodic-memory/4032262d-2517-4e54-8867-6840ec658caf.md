A dedicated prompt file (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) defines guidelines for extracting memories. The prompt instructs Claude on:

**What to extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Component relationships and dependencies
- Performance optimizations

**What NOT to extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

**Scope mapping:**
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a file
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component/area
