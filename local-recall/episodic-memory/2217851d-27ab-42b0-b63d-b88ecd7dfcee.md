# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with names like `transcript_<id>.jsonl`. Each line contains a complete JSON object representing a turn in the conversation.

## Important Notes

- This is the cached transcript location used by Claude Code
- File paths use absolute paths with `/` replaced by `-`
- These transcript files are essential for the MCP server's background daemon which processes them every 5 minutes to extract memories
