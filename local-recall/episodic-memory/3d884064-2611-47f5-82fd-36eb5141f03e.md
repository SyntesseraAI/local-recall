Local Recall uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic embeddings. The model (~133MB) is automatically downloaded to local_cache/ on first use and cached for subsequent runs. First startup may take 30-60 seconds while the model downloads. If the cache gets corrupted (interrupted download), remove the local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5* directory to re-download.
