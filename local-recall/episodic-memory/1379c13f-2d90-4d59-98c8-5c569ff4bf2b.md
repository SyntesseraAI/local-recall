When extracting memories from transcripts, the system should filter out or ignore transcripts that are generated by hook executions (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop hooks). These hook transcripts contain internal system operations and can create problematic recursive memory extractions when included in future sessions.

**Pattern**: Transcripts generated by hooks should be marked or filtered during memory extraction to prevent contaminating the knowledge base with system-internal operations.
