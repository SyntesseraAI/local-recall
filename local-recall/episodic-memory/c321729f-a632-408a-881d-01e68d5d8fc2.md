The Stop hook is currently disabled in the local-recall project. Memory extraction is handled by the MCP server daemon which runs asynchronously every 5 minutes. The daemon processes transcripts from Claude's cache, extracts memories using claude -p, tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection, and recreates memories when transcripts change. This approach avoids blocking Claude Code sessions and allows for more sophisticated memory extraction.
