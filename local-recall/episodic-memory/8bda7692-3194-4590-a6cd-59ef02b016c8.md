# Transcript Condensing for Efficiency

The project implements transcript condensing to reduce token usage when extracting memories.

## Implementation

The `condenseTranscript()` function in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` transforms full transcripts into a compact format:
- Removes verbose repetition and filler
- Summarizes tool invocations (shows tool name and result only)
- Keeps critical information: user requests, assistant explanations, key decisions
- Maintains chronological order and context

## Benefits

- **40-50% token reduction** compared to raw transcripts
- Faster processing when sending to Claude for memory extraction
- Maintains enough context for Claude to understand the session effectively
- Enables more frequent memory extraction without excessive API costs

## When to Use

Always condense transcripts before:
- Sending to Claude for memory extraction (`claude -p`)
- Storing in memory files (if applicable)
- Analyzing for dependencies or relationships

Do NOT condense when:
- Full transcript details are needed for debugging
- Original tool output is critical for understanding the issue
