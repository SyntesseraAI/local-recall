Local Recall uses the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model via the `fastembed` library. The model is approximately 133MB and is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use.

**Performance note**: First startup may take 30-60 seconds for download. Subsequent runs load from cache instantly.

**Troubleshooting**: If you see "Tokenizer file not found" error, the cache is corrupted. Delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and it will re-download automatically.
