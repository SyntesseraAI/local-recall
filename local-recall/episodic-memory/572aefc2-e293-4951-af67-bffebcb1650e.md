# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name uses the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files, where each line is a valid JSON object representing a message or event in the conversation.

## Usage in Local Recall

The transcript collector uses this path to access Claude's transcript cache for memory extraction. The `transcript-collector.ts` module handles parsing these JSONL files to extract conversation content for creating memories.

## Important Notes

- Transcripts are automatically created and managed by Claude Code
- The naming convention (slashes to dashes) applies consistently across all projects
- JSONL format requires line-by-line JSON parsing, not standard JSON array parsing
- Windows paths would likely use a different separator convention (backslashes to dashes or similar)
