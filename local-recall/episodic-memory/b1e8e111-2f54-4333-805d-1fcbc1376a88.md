Local Recall's memory system grows through continuous analysis of session transcripts:

1. The background daemon (MCP server) runs every 5 minutes and processes new transcripts
2. Transcripts are analyzed using the memory extraction system to identify valuable insights
3. Memories are created from the analysis, avoiding duplicates via content hashing
4. The memory index is updated to include new keywords for searchability
5. Over time, the memory system becomes richer and more useful for future sessions

This approach allows the system to learn from actual coding sessions and build domain-specific knowledge without manual intervention. The key is the quality of the extraction prompt and the analysis process.
