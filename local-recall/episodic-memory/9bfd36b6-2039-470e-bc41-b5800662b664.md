The memory extraction prompt at src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts defines clear criteria for what memories should be extracted from transcripts, including focus on architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and user preferences while avoiding generic knowledge, temporary steps, and sensitive data. The prompt uses specific guidance on scope (global, file:, area:) and ensures memories are actionable and specific.
