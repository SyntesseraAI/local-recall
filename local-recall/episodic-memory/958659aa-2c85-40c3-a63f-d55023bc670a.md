# Memory Extraction Process

The memory extraction workflow involves analyzing session transcripts to identify and extract valuable information that helps future AI assistants.

## Key Extraction Guidelines

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Memory Metadata

Each memory should include:
- `subject`: Brief one-line description (max 200 chars)
- `keywords`: Array of 1-10 searchable keywords (lowercase, specific)
- `applies_to`: Scope (`global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`)
- `content`: Detailed markdown content

## Output Format

Memories are returned as JSON with a `memories` array. Empty sessions return `{"memories": []}`.
