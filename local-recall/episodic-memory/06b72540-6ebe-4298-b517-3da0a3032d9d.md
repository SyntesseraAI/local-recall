# Transcript Condensing Feature

When processing Claude Code transcripts for memory extraction, the full transcript can be very large. A condensing step was implemented to:

1. Compress the transcript before sending to Claude for memory extraction
2. Remove redundant information while preserving the key events and decisions
3. Make the prompt more efficient for the LLM

The condensing happens before passing the transcript to Claude for memory analysis. This reduces token usage and improves processing efficiency while maintaining the important context needed for memory extraction.
