Default similarity threshold changed from 0.8 to 0.5 for both episodic and thinking memories. This means memories scoring 50% or higher are included. The threshold comparison is `score >= minSimilarity` so a 0.5 threshold includes memories at exactly 50% similarity. Config locations: `src/core/types.ts` (line 125-126) and environment variables `LOCAL_RECALL_EPISODIC_MIN_SIMILARITY`, `LOCAL_RECALL_THINKING_MIN_SIMILARITY`.
