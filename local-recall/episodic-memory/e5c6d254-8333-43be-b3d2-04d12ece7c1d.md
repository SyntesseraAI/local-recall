# MCP Server Background Daemon

The MCP server includes a background daemon that automatically processes transcripts.

## Behavior

- Runs every 5 minutes
- Syncs transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
- Processes new and modified transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change

## Configuration

The daemon is configured in the MCP server and starts automatically when the server is running. The transcript sync is mentioned in `src/mcp-server/server.ts` and related utilities handle the transcript collection and processing.
