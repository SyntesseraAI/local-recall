Important for AI assistants working on this codebase:

- Memory files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` ARE version-controlled - they will be committed to git
- Use provided MCP tools (memory_create, memory_search, etc.) rather than direct file manipulation
- New memories should have relevant, specific keywords
- Keep memories atomic - one concept per memory
- Consider scope carefully: global vs file-specific vs area-specific
- The SQLite database (memory.sqlite) and recall.log are gitignored and auto-generated
