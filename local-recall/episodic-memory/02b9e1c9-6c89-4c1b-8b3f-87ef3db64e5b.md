# Transcript Format and Structure

## JSONL Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines):
- Each line is a complete JSON object
- Files have extension `.jsonl`
- Newline-separated for streaming parsing

## Expected Fields in Transcript Events

Each line in a transcript JSONL file contains:
- `type`: Event type (e.g., "user_message", "assistant_response", "tool_call")
- `timestamp`: When the event occurred
- `content`: The actual content of the event
- Additional metadata depending on event type

## Parsing Strategy

When reading transcripts:
1. Read file line by line
2. Parse each line as JSON
3. Filter events by type as needed
4. Maintain order based on timestamp

## Integration Points

- The transcript-collector reads from `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/transcripts/`
- Files are processed in chronological order
- Content is used for:
  - Memory extraction
  - Keyword analysis
  - Context building for sessions
