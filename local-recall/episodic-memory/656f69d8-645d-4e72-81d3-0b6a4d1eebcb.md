# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

Transcripts are condensed into a simplified event format before memory extraction to make them more suitable for analysis by Claude Haiku.

## Condensed Format

Events are represented as:
- `[User]` - User requests or prompts
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool execution outcomes

## Purpose

Condensing reduces transcript size and complexity, making it easier for keyword extraction and memory creation during async processing. This supports the background daemon which processes transcripts every 5 minutes.
