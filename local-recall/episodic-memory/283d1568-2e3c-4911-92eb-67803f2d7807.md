Transcripts contain structured events representing the conversation flow:
- `[User]` events: User prompts and requests
- `[Assistant]` events: Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` events: Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` events: Outcomes of tool calls

This event structure is crucial for extracting meaningful memories - the local-recall system needs to identify significant decisions, problems solved, and architectural insights from this flow.
