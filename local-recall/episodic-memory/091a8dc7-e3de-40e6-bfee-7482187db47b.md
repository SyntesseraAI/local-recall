All new features must include:
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Documentation in `docs/` folder
- Updates to existing docs when modifying functionality
- Tests covering both happy paths and edge cases

This is a strict requirement for the project to maintain code quality and knowledge transfer.
