Claude stores projects in `~/.claude/projects/` with a naming convention that encodes the project path by replacing `/` with `-`. The directory name matches the full absolute path to the project with dashes instead of slashes. Project session transcripts are stored in `transcripts/` subdirectory as JSONL files with naming pattern `transcript-*.jsonl`. The background MCP daemon syncs these transcripts for processing.
