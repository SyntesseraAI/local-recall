# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory.

## Usage in Local Recall

The transcript collector uses this path to sync transcripts for memory extraction. The path is constructed dynamically by replacing `/` with `-` in the absolute working directory path.
