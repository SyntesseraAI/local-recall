# User Session Context

The user is working on Local Recall, a memory system for Claude Code. During this session:

## What's Expected

1. **Memory Extraction from Transcripts**: The system should analyze Claude Code session transcripts to extract valuable memories that help future AI assistants
2. **Transcript Analysis Format**: Memories are extracted based on:
   - What was learned
   - What is now known about the codebase
   - What is specific to the codebase
   - What problems were solved

## Key Principles

- Memories should be **specific** with file paths, function names, and concrete details
- Memories should be **concise** - one concept per memory
- Memories should be **actionable** - help future assistants avoid mistakes or work efficiently
- Use appropriate scope: `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`

## What to Extract vs. Avoid

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly
