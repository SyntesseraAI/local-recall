Extract memories that are:
- Specific: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- Actionable: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently
- Contextual: Focused on this codebase, not generic programming knowledge

Avoid extracting temporary debugging steps, obvious information, or sensitive data.
