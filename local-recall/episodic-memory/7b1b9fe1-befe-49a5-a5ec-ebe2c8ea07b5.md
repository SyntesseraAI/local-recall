Session transcripts can be analyzed to extract valuable memories that help future AI assistants. The process involves:
1. Identifying what was learned
2. Noting important facts about the codebase
3. Recording specific patterns and conventions
4. Documenting solved problems

Memories should be specific, concise, and actionable with appropriate scope (global, file-specific, or area-specific).
