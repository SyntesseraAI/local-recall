# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Naming Convention

The project folder name is derived from the working directory path with `/` converted to `_`. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`
- Transcripts location: `~/.claude/projects/Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcript files are stored in JSONL format and named with timestamps:
- Example: `2025-12-01T10-45-30.jsonl`
- Each line in the file is a JSON event from the session

## Key Consideration

When building the MCP server's background daemon that syncs transcripts, the `transcript-collector` needs to:
1. Get the current working directory
2. Convert the path using the same algorithm (replace `/` with `_`)
3. Look for transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/{converted-path}/transcripts/`
4. Track which transcripts have been processed to avoid re-processing
