The system includes background daemon functionality that:

1. Scans transcript files periodically (typically every 5 minutes)
2. Processes transcripts asynchronously to extract memories
3. Tracks which transcripts have been processed using content hashes
4. Recreates memories when transcripts change
5. Operates independently from the main hooks system

This allows the system to build up memory over time without blocking user interactions, and ensures that all transcripts are eventually analyzed for memory extraction.
