The `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` file contains prompt templates that define how memories should be extracted from transcripts. These templates instruct Claude on:
- What constitutes valuable memory content
- How to identify key learnings and insights from sessions
- Memory scope determination (global, file-specific, area-specific)
- Keyword selection for searchability
- Proper formatting of memory content

The templates are used by the MemoryExtractor class to generate consistent, high-quality memories.
