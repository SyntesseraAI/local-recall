# Embedding Model Status

## Removed Feature

The codebase previously included vector embeddings using the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model via the `fastembed` library. These files were deleted:
- `src/core/vector-store.ts` (embedding/vector database)
- `src/core/embedding.ts` (embedding computation)

## Current Search Implementation

Search now uses **keyword-based indexing** only:
- `src/core/search.ts` - Fuzzy keyword search
- `src/core/index.ts` - Builds and maintains keyword index
- Index stored at `local-recall/index.json` (gitignored)

## Reasoning

Keyword search with Claude-extracted keywords is sufficient for finding relevant memories. The added complexity and model download overhead of embeddings was not justified for the project's needs.

## Note for Developers

The files `src/core/embedding.ts` and `src/core/vector-store.ts` may still appear in git history but are not part of the current codebase. Do not reimport or restore them without understanding the project's evolution.
