Raw Claude Code transcripts are condensed into a structured event format before memory extraction. The format includes:

- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool invocations

This condensed format helps the memory extraction model focus on meaningful interactions while filtering out verbose or repetitive content. The condensing process is part of the memory lifecycle and should be implemented in the transcript collection or memory extraction pipeline.
