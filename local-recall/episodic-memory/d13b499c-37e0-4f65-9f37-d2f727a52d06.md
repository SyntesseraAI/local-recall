The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. It processes transcripts asynchronously and relies on prompts defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide the memory extraction process. This is part of the MCP server's background daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes.
