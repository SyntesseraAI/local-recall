Memory files are stored as markdown with YAML frontmatter containing: id (UUID), subject (brief description), keywords (searchable array), applies_to (scope: global/file:/path/area:name), occurred_at (ISO-8601 timestamp for sorting and deduplication), and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix for duplicate detection). The content_hash field is critical for preventing duplicate memories when the same transcript is processed multiple times.
