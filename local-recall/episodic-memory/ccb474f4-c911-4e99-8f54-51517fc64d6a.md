First run may take 30-60 seconds while the ~133MB embedding model downloads to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`. Subsequent runs load from cache. If the cache becomes corrupted, remove the directory and the model will re-download automatically.

Common error: 'Tokenizer file not found' indicates incomplete download - solution is to remove and re-download the cache.
