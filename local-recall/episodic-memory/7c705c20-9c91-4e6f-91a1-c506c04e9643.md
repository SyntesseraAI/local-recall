The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. The extractor reads the condensed transcript format and identifies important facts, decisions, and solutions that should be persisted for future sessions.

Key components:
- Uses `claude -p` command to invoke Haiku for analysis
- Processes transcripts in JSON format with User/Assistant/Tool events
- Extracts memories with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content
- Handles duplicate detection via content_hash and occurred_at timestamp
- Returns memories in structured format for storage
