## Concurrency Configuration Change

**Location**: `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` line 148

**Change**: Reduced `MAX_CONCURRENT_PROCESSORS` from 20 to 5

**Config**: `concurrency: 5` in the p-queue configuration

## Rationale
This change reduces parallel transcript processing load, likely to:
- Prevent system resource exhaustion
- Reduce memory pressure from concurrent Ollama embedding requests
- Ensure more stable performance when processing transcripts

Note: The actual code comment still references "20" as the max - this documentation comment should be updated to reflect the new value of 5.
