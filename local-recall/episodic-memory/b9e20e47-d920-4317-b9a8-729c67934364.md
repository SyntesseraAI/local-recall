Memory `applies_to` field supports three scope types:
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component/area (e.g., `area:authentication`)

This scope system allows precise context injection - SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks can filter memories by current file or working area for relevant, focused context.
