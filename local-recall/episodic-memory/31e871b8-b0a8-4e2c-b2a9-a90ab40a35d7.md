Bumping the version number in both package.json and .claude-plugin/plugin.json (e.g., 0.1.0 → 0.1.1) forces Claude to download a fresh copy of the plugin instead of using cached files. This is useful when the bundled server.js has been updated but users still have an old cached version. Users must uninstall/reinstall the plugin after a version bump to get the new deployment.
