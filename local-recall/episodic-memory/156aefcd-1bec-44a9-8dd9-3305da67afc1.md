# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

When extracting memories from transcripts, use transcript condensing to improve efficiency.

## Why Condensing Matters

- Full transcripts can be very long and expensive to process
- Condensing summarizes the transcript into key events and decisions
- This reduces token usage and processing time
- Still captures all essential information needed for memory extraction

## Implementation

The codebase has a transcript condensing feature (feat: implement transcript condensing for memory extraction):
- Reduces transcript size before sending to Claude API
- Preserves important context and decisions
- Improves memory extraction accuracy and efficiency

## Best Practice

- Always condense transcripts before using them for memory extraction
- This is especially important for long sessions or large projects
- Helps keep memory extraction costs reasonable
