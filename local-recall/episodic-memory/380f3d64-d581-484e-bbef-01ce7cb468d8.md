Claude stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The project folder names are encoded versions of the full path, with the directory structure separated by hyphens (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`). Each project has a UUID-based JSONL file containing session transcripts with messages and tool invocations.
