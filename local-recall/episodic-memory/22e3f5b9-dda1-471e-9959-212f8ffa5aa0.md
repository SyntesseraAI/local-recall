The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude's API with streaming enabled to process transcripts efficiently. The system reads transcript files, sends them to Claude for analysis via the Anthropic SDK, and streams responses back to handle large transcripts without keeping entire responses in memory.
