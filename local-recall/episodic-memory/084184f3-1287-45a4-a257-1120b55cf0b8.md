Changed memory system from mutable knowledge base to immutable episodic log. Each memory is now idempotent and cannot be updated or deleted (only manually removed by user). Deduplication uses two-part key: `occurred_at` (when event happened in transcript) + `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix, 16 chars). This prevents duplicate memories from being created when transcripts are reprocessed. Removed `created_at` and `updated_at` fields - only `occurred_at` is tracked. This approach allows memories to be reframed as episodic and supports the full conversation history processing model.
