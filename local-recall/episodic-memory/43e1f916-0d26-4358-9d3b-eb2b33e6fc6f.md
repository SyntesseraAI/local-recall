# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (`*.jsonl`) with one event per line. Each event is a JSON object representing a message or tool invocation in the conversation.

## Implications

- The transcript collector needs to convert working directory paths to this folder-name format
- This allows tracking which project a transcript belongs to
- File paths with special characters need proper escaping when converting to folder names
