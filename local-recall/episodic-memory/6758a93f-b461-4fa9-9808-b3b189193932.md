The MCP server includes a background daemon that processes transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/). It runs every 5 minutes, extracts memories using `claude -p`, and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes to detect changes. Memories are deleted and recreated when transcripts change.
