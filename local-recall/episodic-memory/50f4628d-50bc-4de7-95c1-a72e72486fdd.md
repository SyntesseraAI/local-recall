The memory extraction prompt in `memory-extraction.ts` provides Claude with specific guidelines on what to extract:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

Memories should be specific (with file paths and function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes). Scope guidance: `global` for codebase-wide, `file:<path>` for specific files, `area:<name>` for components.
