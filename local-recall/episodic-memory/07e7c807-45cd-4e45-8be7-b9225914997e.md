# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → folder named `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcript files are stored as `.jsonl` files within the project folder

## Significance

The `transcript-collector.ts` module needs to handle this path conversion when reading transcripts from Claude's cache. This is important for:
- Building absolute paths back from the folder name
- Matching transcripts to the correct project
- Avoiding hardcoded paths in the application

## Implementation Detail

When implementing transcript collection, ensure the path conversion logic correctly handles:
1. Converting absolute paths to dash-separated names for reading from `~/.claude/projects/`
2. Converting back from dash-separated names to absolute paths for memory scoping
3. Handling edge cases like drive letters on Windows (if supporting cross-platform)
