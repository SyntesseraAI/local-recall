Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. It creates a persistent memory layer allowing multiple AI agents to store/retrieve contextual information about the codebase, share knowledge across sessions, and maintain project-specific memories. All memories are stored locally within the repository, making them version-controllable and shareable among team members.
