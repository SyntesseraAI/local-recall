The transcript collector logs `[transcript]` messages at INFO level when searching for Claude project transcripts and when discovering projects. These logs are only visible if logging is set to appropriate level. Absence of these logs in recall.log typically means either the MCP server isn't running or the code wasn't rebuilt after changes.
