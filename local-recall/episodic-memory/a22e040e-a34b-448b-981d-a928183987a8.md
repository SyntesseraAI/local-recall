The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude's API with streaming to process transcripts. The extraction flow involves:

1. Loading extraction prompts from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`
2. Calling Claude API with the transcript content and extraction prompt
3. Using streaming to handle responses efficiently
4. Parsing extracted memories and storing them via the memory manager

The system is designed to extract actionable memories from session transcripts that help future AI assistants understand the codebase context.
