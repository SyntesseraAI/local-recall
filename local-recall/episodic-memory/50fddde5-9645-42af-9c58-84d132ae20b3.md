## Hook Execution Issue

Hooks are executing successfully but returning empty stdout, preventing memory content from being injected into Claude's context. This breaks the core functionality of memory retrieval.

### Root Cause
- SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks execute without errors
- Both hooks return empty stdout instead of memory content
- Empty output prevents memory injection, making memories invisible to users

### Impact
- Users see "Found 0 relevant memories" even when memories exist
- Memory system appears non-functional despite working infrastructure
- Critical for user experience - hooks must output formatted memory content

### Investigation Needed
- Check if hooks are reading memories correctly from disk
- Verify stdout handling in hook implementations
- Test memory file existence and accessibility
- Ensure JSON parsing and memory retrieval logic is working
