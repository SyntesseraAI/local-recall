Error: "Tokenizer file not found at local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json"

This occurs when embedding model cache is corrupted or incomplete (usually from interrupted download). Fix by:
1. Remove corrupted cache: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*`
2. Model will re-download automatically on next run

First startup downloads BGE-small-en-v1.5 (~133MB), which is normal and only happens once.
