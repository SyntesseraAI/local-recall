The memory extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` instructs Claude to extract memories in a specific YAML frontmatter format with fields: id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, and content_hash. The prompt emphasizes extracting actionable knowledge, architectural decisions, bug fixes, and code patterns specific to the codebase.
