## Context
The `transcript-collector.ts` includes a transcript condensing feature that summarizes long transcripts.

## Purpose
Condensing reduces the amount of context sent to Claude for memory extraction, improving performance when processing long transcripts.

## Current Implementation
The condensing logic is in the transcript collection process and helps manage the size of transcripts before they're processed for memory extraction.

## Trade-offs
Ensure the condensing doesn't lose important details needed for memory extraction - memories should still capture significant learnings even from condensed transcripts.
