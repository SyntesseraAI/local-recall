# Current Refactoring Status

Local-recall is currently on a refactoring branch: `claude/refactor-memory-collection-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`

## Recent Changes

1. **Transcript Condensing**
   - Implemented transcript condensing functionality (commit: 8c4fbf5)
   - Goal: Extract only essential information from transcripts to reduce noise in memory creation

2. **Memory Extraction Enhancement**
   - Enhanced memory extraction and logging (commit: 8602fad)
   - Improved logging consistency
   - Better tracking of memory creation process

3. **Field Changes**
   - Removed `created_at` field from memories
   - Sorting search results by `occurred_at` instead
   - Standardized string quotes and logging consistency

## Directory Restructuring

- Renamed `memories` directory to `episodic-memory` across the project
- Updated all references in code and tests

## Not Yet Merged

These changes are in progress and not yet on the main branch. They represent architectural improvements to how memories are collected and stored.
