Memory extraction in the local-recall project uses the Claude CLI tool with the `-p` flag to inject prompts. The `-p` flag is used with the `claude` command (e.g., `claude -p --model haiku`) to pass prompts for extracting memories from transcripts. This is found in src/core/memory-extractor.ts and uses the prompt defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts.
