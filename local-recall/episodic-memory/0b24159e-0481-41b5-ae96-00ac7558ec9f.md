The IndexManager class and index.json file became redundant after migrating to sqlite-vec for vector embeddings. Removed: IndexManager from src/core/index.ts, index_rebuild tool from MCP server, IndexManager imports from hooks and extractors, related test files. Vector store now handles all indexing via sqlite-vec with LIMIT k constraint in JOIN queries. Tests updated to use resetVectorStore() function for proper isolation between test cases.
