System prompts for memory extraction are centralized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This file contains prompt templates that guide Claude in:
- Extracting relevant memories from transcripts
- Generating appropriate keywords for memories
- Determining correct scope (global, file-specific, or area-specific)

Modifying these prompts will affect how effectively the system extracts and categorizes memories.
