Memories are deduplicated using two fields: `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix) and `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp). The `findDuplicate()` function checks if a memory with the same hash and timestamp already exists before creating a new one. This prevents duplicate memories from being created when the same event or information is encountered multiple times.
