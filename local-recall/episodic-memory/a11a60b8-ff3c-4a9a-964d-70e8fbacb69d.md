Development prerequisites: Node.js 18+ and TypeScript 5.9+. Build process: `npm install && npm run build`. Tests should be comprehensive with unit tests in `tests/unit/`, integration tests in `tests/integration/`, and documentation in `docs/`. All new features must have tests covering happy paths and edge cases. The first run downloads the BGE embedding model (~133MB), which is cached in `local_cache/` for subsequent runs.
