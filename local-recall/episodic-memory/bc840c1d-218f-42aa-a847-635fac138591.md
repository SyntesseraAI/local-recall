The memory extraction prompt is stored in a dedicated file `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` rather than being hardcoded in the extraction logic. This provides:

- **Centralized Control**: The prompt can be updated without modifying the extraction logic
- **Consistency**: All extraction calls use the same prompt template
- **Maintainability**: Easier to refine extraction guidelines over time
- **Version Control**: Prompt changes can be tracked in git

The prompt defines extraction guidelines including what to extract, what not to extract, scope guidelines, and output format requirements.
