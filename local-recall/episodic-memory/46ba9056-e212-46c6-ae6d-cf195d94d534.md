The memory extraction process is being triggered even when transcripts are very short (e.g., just user greetings or initial prompts). When Claude is asked to extract memories from minimal transcripts, it may return empty arrays or malformed responses. The `collectTranscripts` function should consider transcript length and content substance before attempting memory extraction, or the prompt should be adjusted to handle minimal transcripts gracefully.
