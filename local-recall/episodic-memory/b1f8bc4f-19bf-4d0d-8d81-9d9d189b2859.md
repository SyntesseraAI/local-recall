Extract memories that are:
- **Specific**: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- **Concise**: Focus on one concept per memory
- **Actionable**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work efficiently
- **Scope-appropriate**: Use `global` for architecture/conventions, `file:<path>` for specific files, `area:<name>` for components

Avoid extracting: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, sensitive data, or outdated information.
