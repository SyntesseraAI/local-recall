The MCP server runs a background daemon that syncs transcripts from Claude's cache, processes them with `claude -p` to extract memories, tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection, deletes/recreates memories when transcripts change, and runs every 5 minutes. This replaces the Stop hook for memory extraction.
