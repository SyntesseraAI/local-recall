The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API with streaming enabled to efficiently extract memories from transcripts. The extraction uses a prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides Claude to identify and structure memories in the expected JSON format with fields like `subject`, `keywords`, `applies_to`, and `content`.
