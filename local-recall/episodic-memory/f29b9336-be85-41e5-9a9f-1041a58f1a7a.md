# User Preference - Abbreviated Status Format

The user prefers abbreviated status formats in logging output for better readability.

## Preference Details

- Use `[Result: OK]` instead of `[Result: Success]`
- Use `[Result: ERROR]` instead of `[Result: Failed]` or detailed error messages
- Shorter output is preferred over verbose explanations
- This applies to hook logging and tool invocation results

## Context

Discovered during memory extraction process when reviewing how transcripts are condensed. The user works with local-recall which uses hooks and transcripts, so concise formatting is important for log readability.

## Implementation

When logging tool results or status updates, use the abbreviated format: `[Result: OK]` or `[Result: ERROR]` for clarity.
