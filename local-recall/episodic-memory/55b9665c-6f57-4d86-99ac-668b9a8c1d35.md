If you see 'Tokenizer file not found at local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json' error:
- The embedding model cache is corrupted/incomplete (usually interrupted download)
- Solution: Remove corrupted cache with `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*`
- The model will re-download automatically on next run

First startup is slow (~30-60 sec) due to model download, but subsequent runs load from cache.
