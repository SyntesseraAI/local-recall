The memory extraction system in memory-extractor.ts uses the Claude API with streaming to extract memories from transcripts. This approach is more token-efficient than non-streaming alternatives. The extraction process follows a structured prompt defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts that guides Claude through analyzing transcripts and generating well-formed memory objects.
