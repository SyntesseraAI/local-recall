# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Structure

The project folder name encodes the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the project folder:
- Each transcript is a separate `.jsonl` file
- Files are named with timestamps or sequential identifiers
- Each line in a JSONL file is a complete JSON object representing a transcript event

This is important context for the `transcript-collector` module which needs to read and parse these files.
