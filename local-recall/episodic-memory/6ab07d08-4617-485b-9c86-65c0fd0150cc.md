# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The transcript condensing process filters Claude Code transcript events to extract meaningful information for memory creation:

## Events to Include

- `[User]` - User prompts and requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations with names (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool invocation outcomes

## Events to Exclude

- Tool metadata and parameters (command args, file paths in parameters)
- Verbose tool output (truncated output, large responses)
- Internal system events
- Boilerplate content

## Processing Notes

- Messages are processed sequentially to maintain conversation flow
- Tool results with long output should be condensed or summarized
- The goal is to capture the essence of what happened without overwhelming LLM context
- Condensing helps fit multiple sessions' worth of context when extracting memories
