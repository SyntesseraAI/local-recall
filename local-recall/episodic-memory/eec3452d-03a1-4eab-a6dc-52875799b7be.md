The memory extraction system in memory-extractor.ts implements transcript condensing to optimize token usage. Instead of passing full transcripts to Claude for memory extraction, the system condenses transcripts into a compact event format with [User], [Assistant], and [Tool] entries. This reduces context size while preserving essential information needed for memory extraction.
