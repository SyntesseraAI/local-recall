Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows multiple AI agents (Claude Code and others via MCP) to store and retrieve contextual information about the codebase, share knowledge across sessions, and maintain project-specific memories. All memories are stored locally within the repository as markdown files with YAML frontmatter, making them version-controllable and shareable among team members.
