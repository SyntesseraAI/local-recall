Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. Current implementation is complete for core components:

**Built Components:**
- Core memory CRUD operations (memory.ts)
- Index management (index.ts)
- Fuzzy search implementation using Fuse.js (search.ts)
- MCP Server with 6 exposed tools
- Session-start hook that loads relevant memories
- Stop hook that auto-extracts memories from transcripts
- Keyword extraction functionality

**Memory Format:**
- YAML frontmatter with metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash)
- Markdown content body
- Files stored in local-recall/episodic-memory/ directory

**Architecture:**
- Plugin root is the project root following Claude Code's plugin format
- Hooks configured in hooks.json
- MCP server for tool exposure
- Memory index cached at local-recall/index.json (gitignored)
- Memory files ARE version-controlled in git
