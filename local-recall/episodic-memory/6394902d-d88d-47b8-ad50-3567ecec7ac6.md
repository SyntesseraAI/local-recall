The @modelcontextprotocol/sdk was upgraded from ^1.0.0 to 1.23.0, introducing breaking changes between v1.0.0 and v1.23.0. The Server and StdioServerTransport usage pattern changed, which is likely causing the MCP server startup failures. The old pattern with separate Server and StdioServerTransport instances may need to be refactored to match the new SDK API. Check the @modelcontextprotocol/sdk changelog for v1.23.0 to understand the exact API changes needed.
