Local Recall implements semantic search using the `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). The model is cached locally in `local_cache/` directory and downloads automatically on first use (30-60 seconds). This allows semantic similarity matching beyond keyword-based fuzzy search, enabling more intelligent memory retrieval based on meaning rather than just string matching.
