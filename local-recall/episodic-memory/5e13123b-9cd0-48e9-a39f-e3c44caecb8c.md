The vector store uses the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model from fastembed to generate semantic embeddings for memories. Cosine distance similarity scores (0.0 to 1.0) rank search results. Equal scores use recency (occurred_at) as tie-breaker. Embeddings are cached in local_cache/ directory to avoid re-downloading.
