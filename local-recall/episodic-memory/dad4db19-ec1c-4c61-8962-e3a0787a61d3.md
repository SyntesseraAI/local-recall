# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is created by replacing forward slashes in the absolute path with dashes. For example:
- Project: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Structure

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory:
- Path: `~/.claude/projects/[path-with-dashes]/transcripts/`
- Format: One JSON object per line (JSONL)
- Content: Individual message objects from the Claude Code session

This is important for the transcript-collector component which needs to locate and parse Claude's session transcripts to extract memories.
