# Vector Store for Memory Management

## Purpose

Implements semantic search capability for finding memories based on meaning rather than exact keyword matching. Complementary to the keyword-based index.

## Implementation Details

- Uses FastEmbed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for generating embeddings
- Stores embeddings for memory content in persistent storage
- Enables similarity-based search across all memories
- Improves memory retrieval when keywords don't match user intent exactly

## Integration

Works alongside the existing fuzzy keyword search (`src/core/search.ts`) to provide multiple retrieval strategies.
