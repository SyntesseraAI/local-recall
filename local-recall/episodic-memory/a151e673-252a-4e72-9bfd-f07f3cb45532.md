# Memory Extraction Guidelines

## What to Extract

Focus on extracting memories that are:
- **Specific**: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- **Concise**: One concept or discovery per memory
- **Actionable**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently

## Scope Types

Use appropriate scope for memories:
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area

## What NOT to Extract

Skip extracting:
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Memory Structure

Each memory requires:
- `subject`: Brief one-line description (max 200 chars)
- `keywords`: Array of 1-10 searchable keywords (lowercase, specific)
- `applies_to`: Scope string
- `content`: Detailed markdown content
