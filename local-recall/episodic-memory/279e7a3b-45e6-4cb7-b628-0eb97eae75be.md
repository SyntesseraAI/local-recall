# Keyword Extraction Request

The user submitted a request to extract keywords from the LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL transcript analysis instructions.

This appears to be a test or demonstration of the memory extraction process itself - the user provided the transcript analysis framework and asked Claude to extract keywords from it.

## Context

This may indicate:
- Testing of the memory extraction system
- Verification that the system can handle its own documentation
- Development work on improving keyword extraction
