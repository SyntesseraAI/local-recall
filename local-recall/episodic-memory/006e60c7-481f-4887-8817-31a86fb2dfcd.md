# Memory Extraction Process

The memory extraction system analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to automatically create memories.

## Transcript Analysis

When extracting memories from a session transcript, the system:
1. Receives the transcript (already condensed into events)
2. Analyzes what was learned, discovered, and solved
3. Creates structured memory objects

## Memory Extraction Guidelines

Memories should capture:
- **Architectural decisions** and their reasoning
- **Bug fixes** with root cause analysis
- **Code patterns** specific to the project
- **Configuration quirks** or gotchas
- **User preferences** discovered during sessions
- **Component relationships** and dependencies
- **Performance optimizations** applied

## What NOT to Extract

- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Trivial or obvious information
- Sensitive data (keys, passwords)
- Quickly outdated information

## Memory Structure

Each extracted memory includes:
- `subject`: Brief one-line description (max 200 chars)
- `keywords`: 1-10 searchable keywords (lowercase, specific)
- `applies_to`: Scope (`global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`)
- `content`: Detailed markdown content

## Key Insight

The transcript being analyzed is from the CURRENT session, not previously processed ones. This means memories should capture what was actually done and learned in this specific coding session.
