The prompt templates for memory extraction are organized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`:

1. **Purpose**:
   - Provides reusable prompt templates for Claude API calls
   - Ensures consistent memory extraction across all sessions
   - Separates concerns between prompts and implementation logic

2. **Architecture Pattern**:
   - Centralized prompt management makes updates easier
   - Prompts can be versioned and improved over time
   - Enables A/B testing of different extraction strategies

3. **Integration**:
   - Used by `memory-extractor.ts` when calling Claude API
   - Guides the AI model to extract specific types of valuable information
   - Should focus on the extraction guidelines outlined in CLAUDE.md
