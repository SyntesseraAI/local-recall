The search implementation in `src/core/search.ts` provides fuzzy matching for finding relevant memories. Configuration includes a `fuzzyThreshold` (default 0.6) that determines match quality. The fuzzy matching is applied to both keyword and subject searches to improve recall while filtering out irrelevant results.
