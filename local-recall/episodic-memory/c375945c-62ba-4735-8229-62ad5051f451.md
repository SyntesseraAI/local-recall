# Transcript Condensing Feature

The transcript condensing feature was implemented to improve memory extraction performance by creating compact summaries of transcript events.

## How It Works

Instead of processing full transcript JSON objects, the system condenses transcripts into a compact event format:
- `[User]` - User requests and queries
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool operations

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Latency**: Smaller input size for memory extraction prompts
2. **Better Focus**: Claude processes only essential information, avoiding noise from full JSON structures
3. **Consistent Format**: Standardized event format makes extraction more reliable
4. **Cost Reduction**: Fewer tokens processed by Claude during memory extraction

## Implementation

The condensing logic extracts key information from transcript events and formats them in a human-readable way that Claude can easily process to identify valuable memories.
