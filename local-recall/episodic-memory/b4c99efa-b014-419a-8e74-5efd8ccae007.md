The actual Claude project structure stores `.jsonl` transcript files directly in the project folder (e.g., `~/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`), not in a `transcripts` subfolder. The `listSourceTranscripts` method needs to:

1. Look for `.jsonl` files directly in the Claude project directory
2. Not expect a separate `transcripts` folder
3. Handle cases where the directory may contain many files (230+ transcripts found in the test case)

Debug logging showed the issue: "Claude project found but no transcripts folder" - the folder was being found correctly, but the code was looking for transcripts in the wrong location.
