The fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model is automatically downloaded to local_cache/ on first use. This takes 30-60 seconds initially but is cached for subsequent runs. If tokenizer file errors occur, the cached model can be removed with `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to re-download.
