# User Preferences for Code Organization

## Tool Usage Preferences

1. **Use Task tool with specialized agents** for complex searches:
   - Use `Explore` agent for understanding codebase structure and architecture
   - Use `general-purpose` agent for multi-step complex tasks
   - This reduces context usage and improves efficiency

2. **When NOT to use Task tool**:
   - For simple file reads - use `Read` tool directly
   - For class/function definitions - use `Glob` tool
   - For content search in 2-3 files - use `Read` directly

## Code Style

- Prefer **single quotes** in TypeScript code (based on project conventions)
- Use **concise, focused implementations** - avoid over-engineering
- Keep code simple and maintainable
