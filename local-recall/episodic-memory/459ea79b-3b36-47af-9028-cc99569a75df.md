The memory extraction logic and guidelines are defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`, separate from the extraction engine. The prompt includes specific guidelines for what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences) and what NOT to extract (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data, trivial information).
