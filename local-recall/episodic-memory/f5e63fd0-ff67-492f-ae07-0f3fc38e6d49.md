The memory extraction process uses the `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` marker in transcripts to identify sections that should be analyzed for memory extraction. This marker helps the system distinguish between regular Claude Code interactions and explicit memory extraction requests. The marker appears at the beginning of memory extraction prompts to signal the memory extractor module.
