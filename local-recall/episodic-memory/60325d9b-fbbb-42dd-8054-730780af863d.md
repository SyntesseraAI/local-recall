# Claude Transcript Storage

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` with URL-encoded directory names based on the project path.

## Path Structure
- Base directory: `~/.claude/projects/`
- Directory naming: Project paths are URL-encoded (e.g., `/Users/joe/Code/project` becomes `%2FUsers%2Fjoe%2FCode%2Fproject`)
- File format: Transcripts are stored as JSONL files
- Files are named with timestamps and session IDs

## Transcript Collector Usage
The `transcript-collector.ts` utility handles:
- Loading transcripts from Claude's cache
- Parsing JSONL format
- Deduplicating transcripts using content hashes
- Building transcript paths dynamically based on `cwd` parameter

This is critical for the background daemon that processes transcripts to extract memories every 5 minutes.
