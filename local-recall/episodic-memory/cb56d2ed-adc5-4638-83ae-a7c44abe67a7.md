Two environment variables were added to control memory systems independently:

- `LOCAL_RECALL_EPISODIC_ENABLED` (default: `false`) - Controls episodic memory search, session-start retrieval, and extraction
- `LOCAL_RECALL_THINKING_ENABLED` (default: `true`) - Controls thinking memory search and extraction

These were implemented as configuration options parsed from environment variables in `src/utils/config.ts:56-61` and added to the `Config` interface in `src/core/types.ts:118-119`. The flags are then used in all relevant hooks (`user-prompt-submit.ts`, `user-prompt-submit-thinking.ts`, `session-start.ts`) and the MCP server (`src/mcp-server/server.ts`) to conditionally enable/disable memory operations.

This allows users to run the system with episodic memory disabled (default) and thinking memory enabled (default), or customize per their preferences.
