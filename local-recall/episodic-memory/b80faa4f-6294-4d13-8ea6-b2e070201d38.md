Synthetic transcripts are generated during memory extraction and use the model marker '<synthetic>'. These files should be excluded from all processing pipelines.

Implementation:
- Added `isSyntheticTranscript()` method to TranscriptCollector to detect synthetic files
- Added early exit checks in both ThinkingExtractor.processTranscript() and MemoryExtractor.processTranscript()
- Added `cleanupTranscripts()` method that removes both malformed files and synthetic transcripts
- Cleanup runs automatically at start of syncTranscripts()

Stats: 12,594 synthetic files out of 39,879 total transcripts need to be filtered.
