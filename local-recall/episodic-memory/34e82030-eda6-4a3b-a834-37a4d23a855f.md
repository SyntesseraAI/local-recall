All new features must have comprehensive unit tests in `tests/unit/` and integration tests in `tests/integration/`. Documentation goes in `docs/` folder. Update existing docs when modifying functionality. Tests should cover happy paths and edge cases. Project uses TypeScript 5.9+ and Node.js 18+. Memory files must be atomic (one concept per file) with specific keywords and careful scope consideration.
