The memory-extractor module uses Claude's API (currently hardcoded to 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022') to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. It processes condensed transcripts with [User], [Assistant], and [Tool] events, using a specialized prompt from src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts to identify what should be remembered. The extraction happens asynchronously and returns structured memory objects with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content fields.
