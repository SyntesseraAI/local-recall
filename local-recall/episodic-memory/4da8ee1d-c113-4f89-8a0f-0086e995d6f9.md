The `MemoryExtractor` class in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` is responsible for processing session transcripts. It has:
- An `extract(transcript: string)` method that takes a condensed transcript as input
- Uses Claude Haiku to process the transcript with the memory extraction prompt
- Returns an array of memory objects with the structure defined in the extraction prompt
- Handles the Claude API integration for transcript analysis
- Likely includes error handling and validation of extracted memories
