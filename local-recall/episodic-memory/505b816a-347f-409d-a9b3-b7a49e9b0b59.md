After fixes, the thinking extractor successfully processed 59 transcripts and created 616 thinking memories. Each memory contains:
- Unique ID (UUID)
- Subject from first sentence of thinking block
- Frontmatter with metadata (keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash)
- Two sections: `## Thought` (Claude's reasoning) and `## Output` (the response text)

Memories are stored in `local-recall/thinking-memory/` with proper formatting for semantic search via Orama vector store.
