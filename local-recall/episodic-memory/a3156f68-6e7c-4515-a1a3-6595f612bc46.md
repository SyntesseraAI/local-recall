# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Structure

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Replace all forward slashes (`/`) with dashes (`-`)
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/MyProject` becomes `Users-joe-Code-MyProject`

## Transcript Files

Within each project folder:
- Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (one JSON object per line)
- Each line represents a single event in the transcript
- Files are named with timestamps or session identifiers

## Implications for Local Recall

The transcript-collector needs to:
1. Construct the project path using the workspace path with slashes replaced by dashes
2. Read `.jsonl` files from the appropriate `~/.claude/projects/` subdirectory
3. Parse each line as a separate JSON object to reconstruct the session transcript
4. Handle path normalization to ensure correct project folder lookup
