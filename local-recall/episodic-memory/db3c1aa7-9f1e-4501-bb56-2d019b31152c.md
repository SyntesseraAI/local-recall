Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files. All memories are stored locally as version-controlled markdown files with YAML frontmatter containing metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash). The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings for semantic search via the vector store component.
