The MemoryExtractor class in src/core/memory-extractor.ts uses the Anthropic Claude API to analyze transcripts and extract structured memories. It:
- Takes a transcript string as input
- Sends it to Claude's API with a system prompt defining memory extraction rules
- Parses the response to extract memory objects with metadata
- Returns an array of extracted memories ready for storage

This is the core mechanism for converting session transcripts into persistent memories.
