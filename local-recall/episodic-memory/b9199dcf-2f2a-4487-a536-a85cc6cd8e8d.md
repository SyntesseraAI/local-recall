The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku model invoked via stdin (`claude -p`) rather than API calls. This is a cost optimization strategy for processing transcripts to extract memories. The system sends transcript content and a structured extraction prompt to Claude Haiku, which analyzes the session and returns JSON with extracted memories. This approach is used in the user-prompt-submit hook and MCP server background daemon.
