Claude stores project session data in `~/.claude/projects/` with directory names that encode the project path. For example, a project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` has a corresponding directory named something like an encoded version of that path. This is where Claude maintains session transcripts and other project-specific data.
