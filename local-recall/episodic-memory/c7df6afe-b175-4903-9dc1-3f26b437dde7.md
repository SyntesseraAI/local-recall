The MemoryExtractor class (in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts`) processes transcripts by:
1. Using Claude Haiku to extract structured memories from transcript content
2. Generating SHA-256 content hashes to detect duplicate memories
3. Using `occurred_at` timestamp for memory deduplication
4. Creating memories through the Memory manager to avoid duplicates
5. Handling errors gracefully during extraction and creation
