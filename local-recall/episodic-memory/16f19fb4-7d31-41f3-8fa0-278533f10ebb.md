The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model with streaming enabled to process transcripts and extract structured memories. The extraction involves sending transcript content to Claude with a custom prompt (defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) that instructs the model to identify and structure valuable memories from the conversation history.
