When extracting memories from session transcripts, prioritize:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Codebase-specific patterns and conventions
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations applied

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

Memories should be specific with file paths, function names, and concrete details to be most useful for future sessions.
