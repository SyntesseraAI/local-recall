The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude's API to intelligently parse session transcripts and extract valuable memories. The system:

1. Takes raw transcript content as input
2. Uses Claude Haiku to analyze the transcript and extract structured memories
3. Returns memories in a standardized format with subject, keywords, and content
4. Handles audio transcripts that may be condensed into events
5. Filters out trivial or non-actionable information

The prompt for memory extraction is defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and guides Claude to extract only valuable, actionable memories that help future assistants.

This approach enables intelligent, context-aware memory creation without requiring manual curation.
