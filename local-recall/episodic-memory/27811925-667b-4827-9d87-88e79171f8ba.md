The prompts used for memory extraction are centralized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This file contains the system prompts and instructions sent to Claude Haiku when extracting memories from transcripts. This separation allows for version control of prompts and easy iteration on extraction quality without modifying the extractor logic itself.
