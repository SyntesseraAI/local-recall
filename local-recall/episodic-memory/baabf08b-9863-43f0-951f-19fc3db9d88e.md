## Code Style Preference: Double Quotes

The user demonstrated a preference for using double quotes in TypeScript/JavaScript source code during transcript analysis and code modifications. This should be applied when writing or modifying code in the project.

- Use double quotes `"` instead of single quotes `'` for string literals
- Apply this consistently across TypeScript and JavaScript files
- This aligns with the project's recent refactoring commits that standardized quote usage
