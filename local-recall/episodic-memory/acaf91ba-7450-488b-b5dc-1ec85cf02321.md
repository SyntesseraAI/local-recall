The `computeContentHash()` function computes a SHA-256 hash of memory content and truncates it to 16 characters for the `content_hash` field. This hash is used alongside `occurred_at` as a composite deduplication key via the `findDuplicate()` method. The method checks if a memory with matching `occurred_at` and `content_hash` already exists before creating a new one.
