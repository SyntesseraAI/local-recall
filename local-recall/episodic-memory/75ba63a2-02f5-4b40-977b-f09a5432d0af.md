In the `MemoryManager` class, critical initialization tasks (like creating `.gitignore`) should be handled in the constructor rather than waiting for method calls. This ensures that required infrastructure (like the `.gitignore` file) exists immediately when the manager is instantiated, rather than being created lazily on first operation. This pattern prevents issues where essential files might not exist if certain methods are never called.
