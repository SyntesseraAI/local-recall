The user is working on extracting keywords from transcript text to improve memory search functionality in Local Recall. This appears to be part of implementing a feature where:

1. Session transcripts are analyzed to extract relevant keywords
2. Keywords are used to find related memories for context injection
3. The extraction process likely uses Claude Haiku (as mentioned in CLAUDE.md hooks)
4. This supports both the UserPromptSubmit hook (searching based on current prompt) and potential transcript condensing features

This is a core feature for the memory system to work effectively.
