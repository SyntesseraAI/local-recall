Transcripts are condensed into discrete events before being passed to the memory extraction system. The condensed format includes:

- `[User]` - What the user asked or requested
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude said or explained
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This condensed format helps the memory extraction prompt focus on meaningful changes and decisions rather than processing full transcript text.
