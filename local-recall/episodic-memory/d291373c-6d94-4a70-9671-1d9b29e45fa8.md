Memories are deduplicated using two criteria: the `occurred_at` timestamp (when the original event occurred) and a `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix). The findDuplicate method checks if a memory with the same occurred_at and content_hash already exists before creating a new one. This prevents duplicate memories from being created when the same information is extracted multiple times.
