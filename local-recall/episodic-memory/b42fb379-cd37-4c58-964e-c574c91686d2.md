Transcripts are condensed before being sent to the LLM for memory extraction to reduce token usage:
- Condenses transcript format into simplified events ([User], [Assistant], [Tool], [Result])
- Removes non-essential details while preserving actionable information
- Significantly reduces input tokens for the memory extraction LLM call

This preprocessing step is performed before memory extraction to optimize costs and speed while maintaining extraction quality.
