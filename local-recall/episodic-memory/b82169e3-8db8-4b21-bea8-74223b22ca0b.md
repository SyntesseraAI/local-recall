# Memory Extraction Guidelines

## What to Extract
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations and optimizations

## What to Avoid
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Trivial or obvious information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, PII)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Key Principles
- Be specific: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- Be concise: Focus on one concept per memory
- Be actionable: Help future assistants avoid mistakes
