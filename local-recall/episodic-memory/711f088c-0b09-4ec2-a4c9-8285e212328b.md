Claude stores project transcript files in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project directories are encoded with the full path where slashes become dashes (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall` for `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`). Transcript files are stored as JSONL format with `.jsonl` extension.
