Local Recall uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The model (~133MB) is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use.

**Performance:** First startup takes 30-60 seconds while model downloads. Subsequent runs load from cache.

**Troubleshooting:** If tokenizer.json not found error occurs, remove corrupted cache: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` - model re-downloads automatically on next run.
