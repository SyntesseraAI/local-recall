Claude Code projects are stored in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The project directory names use URL encoding of the full path, e.g., `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes a directory like `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`. Transcripts are stored in `transcripts/` subdirectory within each project folder.
