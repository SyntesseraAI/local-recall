The index.json file (stored at local-recall/index.json) is gitignored and auto-generated. It's created by the buildIndex() function in src/core/index.ts by scanning all memory files and indexing their keywords for fast fuzzy search.

This index is loaded at session start to enable quick memory retrieval without scanning all files.
