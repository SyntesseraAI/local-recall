The memory extraction process explicitly excludes certain categories of information:

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps that aren't useful long-term
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that would become outdated quickly

This filtering ensures that only high-value, codebase-specific memories are stored, reducing noise and keeping the memory index focused on useful information for future sessions.
