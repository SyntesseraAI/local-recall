Claude stores transcript JSONL files directly in the project folder (~/.claude/projects/PROJECT_NAME/*.jsonl), not in a `transcripts/` subdirectory. The code previously looked for a `transcripts` subfolder which doesn't exist. Update listSourceTranscripts() to look for .jsonl files in the project root.
