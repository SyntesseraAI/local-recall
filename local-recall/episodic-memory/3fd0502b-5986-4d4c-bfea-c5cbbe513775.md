The BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model is downloaded automatically on first use and cached in local_cache/. Initial startup takes 30-60 seconds for download. If tokenizer file error occurs, the cache can be cleared with 'rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*' and model will re-download automatically.
