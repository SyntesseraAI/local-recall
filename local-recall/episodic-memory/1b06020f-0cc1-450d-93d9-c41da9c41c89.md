Memory extraction prompts are centralized in a dedicated prompts file (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`). This approach:

- Keeps extraction logic separate from API integration code
- Uses `getPrompt()` function to provide the extraction prompt
- Allows easy modification of extraction instructions without touching the extractor code
- Follows the pattern of centralizing AI prompts for consistency
- Reduces coupling between prompt content and extraction logic
