The local-recall system processes condensed transcripts in a specific format:
- `[User]` - User requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude responses
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool outcomes

This format allows efficient analysis and memory extraction by focusing on what was done and learned, rather than raw conversation.
