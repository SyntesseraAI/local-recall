The memory extraction system uses the Claude API with streaming enabled for efficiency. The extractor reads transcripts, condenses them, and extracts structured memories. Uses `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` model for cost efficiency. Implements proper error handling and logging through the logger utility. The system is designed to handle large transcripts by processing them in a streaming fashion rather than loading entire responses into memory.
