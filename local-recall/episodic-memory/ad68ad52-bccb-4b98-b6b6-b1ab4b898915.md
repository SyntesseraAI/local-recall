Updated `analyzeForMemories()` function (lines 169-192) to:
- Save all thinking blocks regardless of length using `generateSubject()` for subjects
- Save only multiline answers (content with 2+ lines) to reduce noise from single-line tool responses
- Use simplified subject generation: first line for multi-line, first sentence for single-line
