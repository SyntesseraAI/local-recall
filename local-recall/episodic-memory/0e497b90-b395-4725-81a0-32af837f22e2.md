# Transcript Collector Path Reuse

The transcript collector should reuse existing transcript paths from earlier inputs within the same session rather than reconstructing them from the working directory.

## Implementation Detail

When the transcript collector receives a new event (like from the stop hook), it often has access to the transcript path from a previous hook input (e.g., session-start or user-prompt-submit). This path can be cached and reused for the current session, avoiding redundant path construction logic.

This improves efficiency and reduces the chance of path construction errors.
