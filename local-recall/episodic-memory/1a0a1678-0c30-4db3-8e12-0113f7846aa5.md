System prompts for memory extraction are centralized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This file contains templates for:
- Condensing transcripts (reducing verbose transcript output to key points)
- Extracting memories (identifying what should be remembered from condensed content)
These prompts guide Claude in determining which information is valuable enough to be extracted as persistent memories.
