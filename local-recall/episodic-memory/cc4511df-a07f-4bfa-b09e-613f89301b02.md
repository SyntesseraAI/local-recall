The memory extraction prompt system provides comprehensive guidelines for Claude to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. The prompts define:

- What should be extracted: architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, performance optimizations
- What should NOT be extracted: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, trivial information, sensitive data, quick-to-outdated info
- Memory format requirements: subject (max 200 chars), keywords (1-10, lowercase, specific), scope (global/file/area), and detailed markdown content

Guides the assistant to use `file:<path>` scope for file-specific memories and `area:<name>` for component-related memories.
