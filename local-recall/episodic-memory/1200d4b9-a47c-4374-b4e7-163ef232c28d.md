The memory extraction prompt includes strict instructions for JSON output format. It defines what memories to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, performance optimizations) and what NOT to extract (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, trivial info, sensitive data, outdated info). The prompt emphasizes being specific with file paths and function names, concise with one concept per memory, and actionable for future assistants.
