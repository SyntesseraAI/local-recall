The vector store implements semantic search using:
- **Cosine distance** similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0, rounded to 2 decimal places)
- Results sorted by score descending
- **Recency tie-breaker**: When scores are equal, more recent memories (occurred_at) are ranked first

This scoring system ensures both semantic relevance and temporal precedence in search results.
