MCP server provides tools for creating idempotent memories, retrieving by ID, semantic search, listing with filters, and rebuilding the vector index. Runs as background daemon syncing transcripts from Claude cache, extracting memories via 'claude -p', tracking with content hashes, and running every 5 minutes. Can be started with 'npm run mcp:start'.
