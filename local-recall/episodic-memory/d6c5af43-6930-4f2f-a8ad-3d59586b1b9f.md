The `ensureGitignore()` function was checking if `.gitignore` exists and only writing if absent. This meant existing files weren't updated with SQLite patterns. Changed to always write the file since it's auto-generated and should reflect current requirements.

**Impact:** New users who already had a `.gitignore` wouldn't get the necessary patterns for `memory.sqlite` exclusion.
