The memory extractor module at src/core/memory-extractor.ts uses the Claude API (via claude-sdk) to parse transcripts and extract structured memories. It processes condensed transcript events and converts them into Memory objects with proper metadata including id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, and content_hash for deduplication.
