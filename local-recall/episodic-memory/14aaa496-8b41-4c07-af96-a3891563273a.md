The embedding strategy needs clarification: embeddings should be persisted in the JSONL files themselves (as a field in each record) rather than stored only in the separate Orama index JSON file.

This ensures:
- Embeddings are preserved when JSONL files are migrated or backed up
- The JSONL format is self-contained without depending on orama-episodic-index.json
- Better consistency between file-based storage and in-memory Orama state

Current implementation stores embeddings only in Orama's binary index format, making them ephemeral.
