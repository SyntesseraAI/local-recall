The memory extraction process analyzes session transcripts to capture valuable knowledge that will help future AI assistants. Memories should be specific (include file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help avoid mistakes or work more efficiently). Extraction focuses on architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, configurations, and user preferences.
