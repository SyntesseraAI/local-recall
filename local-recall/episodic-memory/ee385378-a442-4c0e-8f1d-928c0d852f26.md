# Transcript Condensing Feature

A new feature was implemented to extract valuable memories from raw Claude Code transcripts.

## Purpose

Conde transcripts that are 5KB or larger to extract structured memories that will help future AI assistants understand project context and history.

## Implementation Details

- Transcripts are stored as JSONL format (one JSON object per line)
- Each line contains: `timestamp`, `role` (`user` or `assistant`), `content`, and `tool_calls` (if any)
- The condensing process:
  1. Reads the raw transcript file
  2. Uses `claude -p` (pipes API) with a specialized prompt to extract memories
  3. Stores extracted memories as markdown files with YAML frontmatter
  4. Uses content hashing to detect changes and avoid duplicates

## Integration

This feature is integrated into the MCP server daemon which runs every 5 minutes to process new or updated transcripts.
