# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: Working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` creates folder `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files in this folder
- Each transcript entry is a newline-delimited JSON object

## Transcript Format

Each transcript file contains JSON objects with:
- `timestamp`: ISO-8601 formatted datetime
- `type`: Event type (e.g., 'message', 'tool_call', etc.)
- `content`: The actual content of the event

This is important for memory extraction as the MCP server processes these transcripts to identify memories.
