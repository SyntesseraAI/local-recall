The Local Recall system uses memory extraction to convert session transcripts into persistent memories stored in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. This process happens during the Stop hook phase (now handled by MCP daemon every 5 minutes) and involves:
1. Reading the session transcript
2. Sending it to Claude Haiku with extraction prompts
3. Parsing the response to identify valuable memories
4. Storing memories as markdown files with YAML frontmatter containing metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash)

This allows memories to be version-controlled and shared across sessions.
