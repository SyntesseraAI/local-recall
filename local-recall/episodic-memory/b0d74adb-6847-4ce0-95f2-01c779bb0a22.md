The MemoryExtractor class includes transcript condensing functionality that reduces transcript size before sending to Claude Haiku. This uses a configurable `TRANSCRIPT_CHUNK_SIZE` constant (found in the implementation) to manage memory and processing efficiency. Large transcripts are condensed to fit within this size limit, improving performance and reducing API costs when extracting memories.
