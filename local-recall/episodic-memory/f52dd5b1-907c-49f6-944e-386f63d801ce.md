Memory extraction focuses on learning from session transcripts by identifying: architectural decisions and reasoning, bug fixes with root cause analysis, code patterns and conventions specific to the project, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, and performance optimizations. Generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, and sensitive data are explicitly excluded.
