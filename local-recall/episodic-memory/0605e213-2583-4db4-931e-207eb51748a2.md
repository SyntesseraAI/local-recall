The `memory-extractor.ts` module uses the Claude API (via `claude -p`) to intelligently extract memories from session transcripts. It sends condensed transcript events to Claude with a structured prompt that returns memories in JSON format with required fields (subject, keywords, applies_to, content). This is the core mechanism for converting raw session data into structured, searchable memories.
