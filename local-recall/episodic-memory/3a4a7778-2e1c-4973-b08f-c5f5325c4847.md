Memory management in Local Recall does NOT include compaction or garbage collection. The only deduplication mechanism is:

- **Duplicate Prevention at Creation**: The `MemoryManager.findDuplicate()` method (`src/core/memory.ts:52-67`) checks if a memory with the same `occurred_at` timestamp AND `content_hash` already exists before creating
- If a duplicate is found, the existing memory is returned instead of creating a new one
- No automatic cleanup of old memories
- No memory compaction or consolidation
- Configuration includes `maxMemories` setting (in `src/utils/config.ts`) but this is not actively enforced

This means the index can grow unbounded if different memories are continuously created, even for related concepts.
