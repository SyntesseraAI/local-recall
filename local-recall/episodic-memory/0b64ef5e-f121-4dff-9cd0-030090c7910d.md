The memory extraction process uses streaming from the Anthropic SDK to handle Claude's responses:

- Streaming allows processing of large transcripts without waiting for complete responses
- Responses are parsed as they arrive (likely using newline-delimited JSON or similar format)
- This enables efficient memory creation even for lengthy session transcripts
- The streaming approach is integrated into the memory creation pipeline
