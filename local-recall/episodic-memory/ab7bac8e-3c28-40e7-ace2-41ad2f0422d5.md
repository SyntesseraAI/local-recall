When embedding memories for the vector store, Local Recall concatenates the memory's subject and content fields with a newline separator: `${memory.subject}\n\n${memory.content}`. This combined text is then passed to passageEmbed() to create the 384-dimensional embedding. This approach ensures both the memory's title and detailed content are considered during semantic similarity searches.
