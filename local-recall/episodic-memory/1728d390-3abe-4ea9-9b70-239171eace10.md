The fuzzy search implementation uses a hardcoded threshold of 0.6 for all queries. Consider tuning this based on keyword characteristics: shorter keywords (1-3 chars) may need higher thresholds to avoid false matches, while longer keywords (8+ chars) can use lower thresholds. Query-specific tuning could improve search relevance.
