# Transcript Collector Path Resolution

The transcript collector must handle both:
1. **Absolute paths** - Direct paths to project directories
2. **Relative paths** - Paths relative to the current working directory

## Implementation Details

When resolving the Claude projects directory path:
- Accept project paths as parameters
- Resolve relative paths using the current working directory as base
- Convert absolute paths to the format used by Claude (slashes to hyphens)
- Handle path normalization (remove trailing slashes, resolve `.` references)

This flexibility allows the transcript collector to work in different contexts where the project path might be specified relatively or absolutely.
