Memory extraction prompts provide detailed guidelines for identifying valuable memories from transcripts. The prompts instruct the extraction system to focus on:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- Performance optimizations
- Important component relationships

The prompts also specify which information should NOT be extracted (generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data, outdated information) and define the memory format with required fields: subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content.
