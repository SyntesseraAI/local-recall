# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

## Feature Implementation
The project implements transcript condensing to create more efficient memories:
- Raw transcripts are condensed before being processed for memory extraction
- This reduces the amount of data to process and improves token efficiency
- Particularly useful for long sessions with repetitive interactions

## Benefits
- Smaller transcript data reduces processing time
- More focused memory extraction from key interactions
- Better use of token budgets when processing with LLMs
