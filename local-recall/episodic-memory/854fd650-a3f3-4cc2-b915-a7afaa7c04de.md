Created `src/utils/gitignore.ts` with a shared `ensureGitignore(baseDir)` function to eliminate duplicate gitignore creation logic. Previously, both `src/core/memory.ts` and `src/core/index.ts` had identical implementations of gitignore creation. Now they import and call the shared utility function, reducing code duplication and making maintenance easier.
