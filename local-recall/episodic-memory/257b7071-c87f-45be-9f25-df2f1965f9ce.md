Updated `analyzeForMemories` function to:
- Save **all thinking** from transcript (even single-line), using just the first sentence as subject
- Save **only multiline answers** (content with 2+ lines)

This helps capture the AI's reasoning process while focusing memory storage on substantive answers.
