# Keyword Extraction for Memory Search

The UserPromptSubmit hook extracts keywords from user prompts using Claude Haiku API to improve memory search relevance.

## Implementation Details

- Uses `claude -p --model haiku` to extract keywords from user input
- Keywords are used to search the memory index via fuzzy matching
- This approach is more intelligent than simple keyword tokenization
- Helps find relevant memories even when exact terms don't match

## Why It Matters

By extracting semantic keywords rather than just using tokenization, the system can understand user intent better and surface more relevant memories. This is a key part of the UserPromptSubmit hook's memory injection strategy.
