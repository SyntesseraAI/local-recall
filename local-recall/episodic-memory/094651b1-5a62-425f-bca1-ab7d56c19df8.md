The `memory-extractor.ts` file is a critical component that handles asynchronous extraction of memories from transcripts. It's used by the MCP server's background daemon to automatically process transcripts and create memories without requiring user intervention.

This enables the system to build up a knowledge base over time as coding sessions occur.
