# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

Commit 8c4fbf5 implemented transcript condensing as a feature. This allows the transcript-collector to:
- Compress or summarize transcript data for more efficient memory extraction
- Reduce token usage when processing transcripts with Claude
- Improve performance when extracting memories from large transcripts

This is used in the memory extraction pipeline to create concise transcript summaries before passing them to Claude for memory generation.
