# Transcript Analysis Preference

The user demonstrated a preference for keyword-based extraction from transcripts rather than semantic analysis or other methods. This is reflected in the implementation where:

- Keywords are extracted from user prompts in the `UserPromptSubmit` hook
- The MCP server uses keyword extraction for memory creation
- Keywords drive the search and retrieval process

This approach is simpler, faster, and more controllable than semantic analysis, which aligns with the project's philosophy of keeping things lightweight and local.
