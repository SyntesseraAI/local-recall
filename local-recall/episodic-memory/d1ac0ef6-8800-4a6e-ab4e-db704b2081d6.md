The vector store was migrated from Orama JSON index files (orama-episodic-index.json) to SQLite. The current implementation in src/core/vector-store.ts uses a relational database with two tables: `memories` (metadata) and `memory_embeddings` (vector data).

Data flows into SQLite through three pathways:
1. **On memory creation**: MemoryManager.createMemory() writes markdown file, then immediately calls vectorStore.add() to insert embedding
2. **On vector store initialization**: VectorStore.initialize() syncs all existing memory files into database
3. **MCP server daemon**: Calls vectorStore.sync(memories) to keep database current with file changes
