The local-recall-plugin directory contains skills that are part of the marketplace. When updating skills:

1. Skills are stored in `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/skills/`
2. Version bumps should be reflected in package.json
3. MCP tool descriptions should include usage guidance for better discoverability
4. Plugin metadata in package.json affects how tools appear in the marketplace
5. Commits that add skills should reference the feature in the commit message

Recent example: Version 0.1.3 added two skills (check-memories, proactive-recall) alongside 8 thinking memory files.
