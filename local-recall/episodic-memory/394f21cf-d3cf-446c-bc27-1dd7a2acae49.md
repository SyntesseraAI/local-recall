The git status shows hundreds of deleted episodic memory files (marked with `D` prefix). This is expected during memory migration or cleanup operations. These deletions should be staged and committed as part of the migration process. Do not panic when seeing many deleted episodic-memory/*.md files - this is a normal part of memory restructuring or format updates.
