# New Embedding and Vector Storage Implementation

Two new modules have been added to the core:

## src/core/embedding.ts
- Handles text embedding using FastEmbed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model
- Provides `embed()` function to convert text to vectors
- Uses model caching to improve performance on subsequent runs
- Model cache location: `local_cache/` directory

## src/core/vector-store.ts
- Implements semantic search using vector similarity
- Provides `searchByVector()` for finding similar memories based on embeddings
- Uses cosine similarity for vector comparison
- Integrates with the existing memory system

These modules enable semantic search capabilities beyond the existing fuzzy keyword matching, allowing memories to be found by meaning rather than just keywords.
