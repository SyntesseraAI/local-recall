Memories are organized using three scope patterns:

1. **global** - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences, patterns)
2. **file:<path>** - Specific to a particular file (e.g., file:src/utils/config.ts)
3. **area:<name>** - Related to a component or feature area (e.g., area:authentication)

This scoping system helps future assistants quickly identify which memories are relevant to their current work. Proper scoping is critical for the memory system's effectiveness in providing contextual information.
