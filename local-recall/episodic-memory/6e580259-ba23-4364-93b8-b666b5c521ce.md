## Recent Storage Migration
Memory system recently migrated from individual markdown files to a hybrid JSONL + markdown approach with 6-digit zero-padded file organization.

## Current Format
- Memories stored as individual markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` and `local-recall/thinking-memory/`
- Each memory file contains YAML frontmatter with metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash)
- JSONL files (`episodic-000001.jsonl`, `thinking-000001.jsonl`) track memory entries across sessions
- Files use 6-digit padding: episodic-000001, episodic-000002, etc.

## Important Details
- Git tracks individual markdown memory files (they are version-controlled)
- Index files (`orama-episodic-index.json`, `orama-thinking-index.json`) are gitignored
- Gitignore is auto-generated by the system
- Migration was recent (commit: "feat: Migrate memory storage to JSONL format with multi-file support")
