# Memory Extraction Using Project Context

The Local Recall system uses Claude's project context (`claude -p`) for memory extraction to ensure accurate, contextual memory creation.

## Implementation Details

- Uses the `claude` CLI with `-p` flag to provide the full project context
- Extracts memories from condensed transcripts using Claude's understanding of the codebase
- The extracted memories are more accurate and relevant because Claude understands the project architecture

## Benefits

1. **Better Memory Quality**: Claude understands the codebase context, so extracted memories are more meaningful
2. **Architectural Awareness**: Claude can identify architectural patterns and decisions from transcripts
3. **Semantic Understanding**: Memories are extracted with proper understanding of code relationships

## Current Implementation

- Handled by the `TranscriptExtractor` or memory extraction prompts
- Part of the MCP server's background daemon pipeline
- Runs as part of the 5-minute sync cycle for new transcripts
