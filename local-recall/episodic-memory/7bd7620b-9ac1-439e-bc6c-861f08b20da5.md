# Transcript Condensing Feature

A new feature was implemented to condense transcripts before sending them to Claude for memory extraction.

## Purpose

Reduce token usage and API costs when extracting memories from long transcripts by removing redundant or less important information while preserving key details.

## Implementation

- Located in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`
- Condenses full transcripts into summarized versions
- Maintains important context while reducing overall size
- Used by the memory extraction pipeline

## Use Cases

1. Reducing API costs for memory extraction via Claude API
2. Improving memory extraction quality by focusing on essential information
3. Handling large transcripts that would exceed API token limits

## Integration

This feature is part of the transcript collection and memory extraction pipeline, likely used before sending transcripts to Claude for analysis.
