All memories are stored as markdown files in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory with YAML frontmatter containing metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash). These files are version-controlled in git and tracked as part of the codebase. The directory is auto-created by memory creation functions.
