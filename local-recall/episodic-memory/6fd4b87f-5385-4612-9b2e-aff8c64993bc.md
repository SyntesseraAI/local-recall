The Stop hook is currently disabled. Memory extraction was originally planned to happen on session stop, but this has been moved to the MCP server background daemon for better performance. The daemon processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes instead of blocking at session end.

Future improvement: Re-enable the Stop hook to capture memories immediately on session exit, with MCP daemon serving as a fallback for missed sessions.
