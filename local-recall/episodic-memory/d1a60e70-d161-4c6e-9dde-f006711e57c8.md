Memory files are stored as markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory and are tracked in git (not gitignored). Each memory is a structured markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash). This allows memories to be version-controlled and shared across team members.
