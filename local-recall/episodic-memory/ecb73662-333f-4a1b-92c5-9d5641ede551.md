The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku to automatically parse session transcripts and extract valuable memories. The extractor calls Claude's API with a structured prompt to identify and categorize learnings from transcripts. This is part of the background daemon that processes memories asynchronously.
