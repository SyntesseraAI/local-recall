The vector store in `src/core/vector-store.ts` uses:
- `better-sqlite3` with the `sqlite-vec` extension for efficient vector operations
- `fastembed` library for generating embeddings using BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB)
- Cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0, rounded to 2 decimal places)
- Recency tie-breaker: When similarity scores are equal, more recent memories (by `occurred_at`) rank higher
- Model is cached locally in `local_cache/` for fast startup after first download

Initial model download takes 30-60 seconds; subsequent runs load from cache instantly.
