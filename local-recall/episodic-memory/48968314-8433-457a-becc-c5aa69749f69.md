Claude Code caches transcripts in a specific directory structure:

- **Location**: `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
- **Usage**: The transcript files stored here are used by the MCP server daemon to process and extract memories
- **Processing**: The daemon syncs transcripts from this cache location and processes them using `claude -p` to extract memories
- **Important**: The MCP background daemon scans this location every 5 minutes to detect new or changed transcripts

This is critical for the local-recall memory extraction system as it's the source of transcript data that gets analyzed to create new memories.
