The memory extraction process uses the Claude API (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) with a carefully structured system prompt defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts. The prompt guides Claude to extract 3-8 memories per session, focusing on architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and configuration quirks. Memories are output as JSON arrays with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and markdown content fields. The system expects memories to be actionable and specific to the codebase.
