# Transcript Collector Deduplication

The transcript collector in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` maintains state to track which transcripts have been processed and avoid duplicate memory creation.

## Key Implementation Details

- Tracks processed transcripts using content hashes (SHA-256 prefix)
- Stores transcript metadata to detect when transcripts have been updated or changed
- When a transcript's hash changes, old memories are deleted and new ones are created
- This prevents duplicate memories and handles transcript updates correctly

## State Tracking

The collector maintains an index of processed transcripts with their content hashes to enable efficient change detection on subsequent runs.
