# Transcript Error Handling

When working with Claude's transcript files:

1. **Files may not exist**: The transcript directory might not be created yet if it's a new project
2. **Files may be incomplete**: Transcripts are written incrementally and may not be fully formed
3. **Files may be empty**: A session might not have any transcript data yet

## Implementation Pattern

Transcript collection code should:
- Check for file existence before reading
- Handle missing or empty files gracefully
- Use defensive parsing (e.g., try-catch for JSON parsing)
- Not crash or error when transcripts aren't available

This is especially important for hooks (SessionStart, Stop, UserPromptSubmit) that execute automatically.
