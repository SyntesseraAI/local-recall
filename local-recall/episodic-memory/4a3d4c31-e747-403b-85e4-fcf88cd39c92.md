Transcripts are the primary input source for the memory extraction system. The extraction process:

1. Receives condensed transcript data (user messages, assistant responses, tool invocations)
2. Analyzes the transcript to identify:
   - What was learned or discovered
   - Important facts about the codebase
   - Code patterns and conventions
   - Bugs fixed and their solutions
3. Extracts actionable memories that will help future assistants
4. Categorizes memories with appropriate scope (global, file-specific, or area-specific)

This is a key component of the Local Recall system's ability to accumulate knowledge across sessions.
