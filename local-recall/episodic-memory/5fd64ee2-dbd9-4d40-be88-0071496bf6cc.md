The memory extraction system analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to extract valuable information that should persist across sessions. This includes architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, user preferences, and component relationships. The extracted memories are stored in structured markdown files in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory with YAML frontmatter containing metadata like id, subject, keywords, scope, timestamp, and content hash for deduplication.
