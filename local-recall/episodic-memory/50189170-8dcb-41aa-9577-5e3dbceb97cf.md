When debugging hook issues, verbose logging is essential because hooks run in subprocess context where normal debugging is difficult. The improved logging now includes: process IDs, timing information, lock state, and full stack traces. This helps identify subprocess-specific issues like mutex failures that don't occur in normal execution.
