Configuration is centralized in `src/utils/config.ts` and includes `maxMemories` option (default: 1000). This is referenced in CLAUDE.md documentation as a configuration limit, but there is no active enforcement or cleanup mechanism that removes memories when the limit is exceeded. The configuration exists but is not actively used for memory management.
