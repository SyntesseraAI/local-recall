# Development Requirements

## Testing Standards
- All new features MUST have corresponding unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests go in `tests/integration/`
- Tests must cover both happy paths and edge cases

## Documentation
- Documentation placed in `docs/` folder
- Must update existing docs when modifying functionality
- Code comments only needed where logic isn't self-evident

## Build and Scripts
- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript
- `npm run dev` - Watch mode
- `npm run test` - Run all tests
- `npm run lint` - Lint code
- `npm run mcp:start` - Start MCP server

## Embedding Model
BGE-small-en-v1.5 from fastembed library:
- Downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use (~133MB)
- First run takes 30-60 seconds
- Subsequent runs load from cache
