Local Recall is a plugin that enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. All memories are stored locally within the repository, making them version-controllable and shareable. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings for semantic search and exposes memory tools via MCP.
