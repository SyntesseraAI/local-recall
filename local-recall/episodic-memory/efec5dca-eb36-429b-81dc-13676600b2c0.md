Removed `ts-textrank` npm dependency and simplified `generateSubject()` to:
- Multi-line text: return the first line
- Single-line text: return text up to first `.` (period), or all text if no period present

This is much simpler and more predictable than the previous text rank algorithm while still capturing meaningful subjects for memories.
