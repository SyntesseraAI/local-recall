The MCP server runs a background daemon that processes transcripts from Claude's cache every 5 minutes. It syncs transcripts, extracts memories using Claude, tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection, and deletes/recreates memories when transcripts change. This handles memory extraction since the Stop hook is currently disabled.
