The memory extraction pipeline uses Claude Haiku (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001) to convert session transcripts into structured memories. The system uses a dedicated system prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides Claude to extract actionable, specific memories from transcripts. The extractor processes condensed transcript events and produces memories with proper metadata (subject, keywords, applies_to scope, occurred_at timestamp, content_hash for deduplication).
