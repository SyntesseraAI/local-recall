The vector-store implementation uses Python's fastembed library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic embeddings. The model (~133MB) is auto-downloaded to local_cache/ on first run. A Python bridge script (local_cache/bridge.py) wraps fastembed for Node.js integration. This enables semantic search alongside keyword-based search.
