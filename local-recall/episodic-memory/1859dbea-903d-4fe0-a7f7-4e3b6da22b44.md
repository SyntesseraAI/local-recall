Memory creation best practices:

1. **Atomic Structure**: Each memory should focus on one concept or discovery to maintain clarity and usability
2. **Specific Keywords**: Use concrete, specific keywords (lowercase) rather than generic terms to enable better fuzzy searching
3. **Appropriate Scope**: Carefully consider scope:
   - `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions)
   - `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file
   - `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area
4. **Actionable Content**: Memories should help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently
5. **Include Context**: File paths, function names, and concrete details make memories more useful
