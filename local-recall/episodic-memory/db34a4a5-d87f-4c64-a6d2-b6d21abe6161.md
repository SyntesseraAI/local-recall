The memory extraction prompt (in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) specifies what should be extracted from transcripts. Valid memories include: architectural decisions and reasoning, bug fixes with root cause analysis, code patterns specific to the project, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, and performance optimizations. Invalid memories (DO NOT extract) include: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious/trivial information, sensitive data, and outdated information.
