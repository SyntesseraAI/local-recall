# Keyword Extraction Request

The user asked Claude to extract keywords from provided text and return them as a JSON array of strings with no explanation.

## Request Format

User provided instructions for Claude to:
1. Analyze text content
2. Extract relevant keywords
3. Return ONLY a JSON array
4. No explanation or additional text

This appears to be a test or validation of Claude's ability to follow strict output format requirements.
