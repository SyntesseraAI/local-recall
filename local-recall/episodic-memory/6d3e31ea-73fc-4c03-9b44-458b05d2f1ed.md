# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Structure

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path to the project:
- Example: Project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `users-joe-code-syntessera-local-recall`
- Slashes are replaced with dashes
- Path is lowercased

## Transcript Files

Inside each project folder:
- Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) format
- Each line is a separate JSON object representing a transcript event
- Files are named based on session timestamps or IDs
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`

## Relevance to Local Recall

Local Recall's transcript collector needs to:
1. Monitor the `~/.claude/projects/` directory
2. Find the correct project folder for the current working directory
3. Extract transcripts from the JSONL files
4. Process them to extract memories

This is critical for the MCP server's background daemon that syncs transcripts every 5 minutes.
