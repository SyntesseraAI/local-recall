The memory extraction process uses Claude Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) to analyze transcripts and extract meaningful memories. The extraction is driven by a detailed system prompt stored in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts that guides the LLM to identify valuable context, architectural decisions, bug fixes, and patterns.

Key implementation details:
- Uses Anthropic SDK for API communication
- Processes transcripts through a structured extraction pipeline
- Returns an array of memory objects with subject, keywords, applies_to, and content fields
- Handles edge cases like empty or minimal transcripts gracefully
