The git status output shows numerous deleted episodic-memory files (marked with 'D'), indicating the episodic-memory directory contains stale or outdated memory files that should be cleaned up. This suggests:

1. Memory files may accumulate over time and need periodic pruning
2. When memories become irrelevant or outdated, they should be explicitly deleted and committed
3. The high number of deleted files suggests a cleanup operation is overdue
4. Future sessions should consider implementing automatic memory rotation/expiration for old memories

This is a maintenance consideration for the Local Recall system to prevent the episodic-memory directory from growing unbounded.
