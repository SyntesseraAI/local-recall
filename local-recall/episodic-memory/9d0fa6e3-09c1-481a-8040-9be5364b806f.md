The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` (lines 304-329) uses the `condenseTranscript()` function to reduce transcript size before sending to Claude for memory extraction. This optimization significantly reduces token usage in the Claude API calls, making the extraction process more efficient. The condensed transcript focuses on key events and tool results while removing verbose explanations.
