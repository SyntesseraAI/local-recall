# Memory Extraction Guidelines

When extracting memories from transcripts:

1. **Be specific**: Include file paths, function names, and concrete details
2. **Be concise**: Each memory should focus on one concept or discovery
3. **Be actionable**: Memories should help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently
4. **Use appropriate scope**: Choose between `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`

## What to Extract

DO extract:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- Important relationships between components
- User preferences discovered during sessions

DO NOT extract:
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly
