The memory extractor module (src/core/memory-extractor.ts) is responsible for analyzing Claude Code session transcripts and extracting valuable memories. It uses transcript condensing to convert full transcripts into condensed event format for analysis. The extractor then uses Claude Haiku to analyze these condensed transcripts and generate memories with subjects, keywords, and content.
