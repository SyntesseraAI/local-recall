When creating memories:
- **Be specific**: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- **Be concise**: Focus on one concept per memory
- **Be actionable**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work efficiently
- **Use appropriate scope**:
  - `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
  - `file:<path>` - Specific to particular file
  - `area:<name>` - Related to component or area

DO extract: architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, performance optimizations

DO NOT extract: generic knowledge, temporary debugging, obvious info, sensitive data, outdated information
