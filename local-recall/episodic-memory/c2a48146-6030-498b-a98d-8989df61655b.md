The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. It employs structured prompts defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide the extraction process. The system processes transcripts semantically rather than through simple parsing, enabling intelligent identification of meaningful insights that should be persisted for future sessions.
