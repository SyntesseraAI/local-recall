The system maintainers have centralized memory extraction prompts in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This separation of concerns allows:

- Easy modification of extraction rules without changing core logic
- Consistent prompt instructions across all memory extraction operations
- Clear guidelines for what should and shouldn't be extracted (architectural decisions vs generic knowledge)
- Structured output requirements (JSON format with memories array)
