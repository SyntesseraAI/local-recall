The SessionStart hook receives JSON input with `session_id`, `transcript_path`, and `cwd` fields. The hook should asynchronously load and inject recent memories. The input is passed via stdin, and output should be sent to stdout in the plugin hook JSON format with `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`.
