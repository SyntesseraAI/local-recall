# Memory Extraction Architecture

## Process

The MCP server implements a background daemon that:
1. Runs asynchronously every 5 minutes
2. Reads transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/*/transcripts/`
3. Analyzes transcript content to extract meaningful memories
4. Stores extracted memories as markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
5. Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes to detect changes

## Why Transcripts Matter

Transcripts contain the complete conversation history between the user and Claude, including:
- Problems encountered and how they were solved
- Code changes made and their reasoning
- User preferences and patterns
- Architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Bug fixes and their root causes

This makes them invaluable source material for creating persistent memories.

## Content Hashing

The system tracks content hashes of processed transcripts to:
- Detect when a transcript has been modified
- Avoid duplicate memory creation
- Clean up old memories when transcripts change
