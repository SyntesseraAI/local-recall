Local Recall has several core components:

- **Memory Manager** (`src/core/memory.ts`): Handles CRD operations (Create, Read, Delete) for memory files
- **Vector Store** (`src/core/vector-store.ts`): SQLite-backed semantic search using `better-sqlite3` and `sqlite-vec` extension
- **Embedding Service** (`src/core/embedding.ts`): Uses `fastembed` with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for vector embeddings
- **Search** (`src/core/search.ts`): Semantic search implementation using cosine distance similarity
- **Transcript Collection** (`src/core/transcript-collector.ts`): Collects transcripts from Claude cache
- **Memory Extraction** (`src/core/memory-extractor.ts`): Extracts memories from transcripts using Claude

The BGE-small-en-v1.5 model downloads automatically on first use (~30-60 seconds) and is cached in `local_cache/` for subsequent runs.
