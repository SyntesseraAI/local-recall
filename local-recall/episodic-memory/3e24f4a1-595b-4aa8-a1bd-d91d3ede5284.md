The memory extraction prompt (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) defines detailed instructions for Claude to extract memories from transcripts. It specifies memory categories to look for (architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, conventions, preferences), guidelines for what to include/exclude, and the exact JSON output format required. The prompt helps ensure consistent, high-quality memory extraction across sessions.
