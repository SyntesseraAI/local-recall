# Embedding Model Configuration

The Local Recall project uses the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model via the `fastembed` library for semantic search.

## Model Details

- **Model**: BGE-small-en-v1.5
- **Library**: fastembed
- **Size**: ~133MB
- **Cache Location**: `local_cache/` directory
- **Auto-download**: Model downloads automatically on first run
- **Subsequent runs**: Load from cache for faster startup

## First Run Considerations

Initial startup may take 30-60 seconds while downloading the model. This is normal and only occurs once.

## Troubleshooting

If encountering "Tokenizer file not found" error at `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json`, the cache is likely corrupted. Solution: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to force re-download on next run.
