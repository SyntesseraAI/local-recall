The codebase has migrated from using JSON index files (`orama-episodic-index.json`, `orama-thinking-index.json`) to storing vector embeddings in SQLite using sql.js. The vector store implementation in `src/core/vector-store.ts` now:

1. Creates/initializes SQLite database with `memories` and `memory_embeddings` tables
2. Stores embeddings as BLOB data in the `embeddings` column
3. Uses SQLite's vector similarity search (MATCH operator) to find nearest neighbors
4. Maintains index files for persistence (written as JSON)

This provides better scalability and native similarity search capabilities compared to the previous Orama-based approach.
