The MemoryExtractor class uses Claude Haiku (via `claude -p --model haiku`) to process transcript condensations and extract structured memory items. The extraction follows a specific prompt format defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts that guides the model to generate memories with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content fields. The extractor parses the model's JSON response to create Memory objects.
