The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku via `claude -p` command with a dedicated prompt file. The extraction returns structured JSON with memory objects containing id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, and content_hash fields. This approach ensures consistent memory creation across sessions.
