The memory extractor in src/core/memory-extractor.ts uses the Claude Haiku API to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. It sends prompts via the Anthropic API with a system message that instructs Claude to identify key learnings, decisions, and patterns from the transcript. The system uses structured JSON output for parsing extracted memories.
