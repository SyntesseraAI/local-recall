The memory extraction pipeline includes a transcript condensing step that reduces verbose transcript content before feeding it to Claude for memory extraction. This optimization reduces token usage and focuses the model on extracting only the most relevant information from lengthy session transcripts, improving both efficiency and quality of extracted memories.
