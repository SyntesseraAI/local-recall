The `ensureGitignore()` method now ensures the `local-recall` base directory exists before attempting to write the `.gitignore` file (line 210). This allows the method to work correctly on fresh projects where the local-recall folder hasn't been created yet.

The method uses `fs.mkdirSync()` with `{ recursive: true }` to safely create the directory even if it already exists.
