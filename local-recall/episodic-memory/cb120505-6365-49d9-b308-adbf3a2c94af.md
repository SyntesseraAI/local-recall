# Transcript Processing Strategy

When processing transcripts for memory extraction, focus on semantic content rather than low-level tool details.

## What to Keep
- User requests and intent
- Key insights and decisions made
- Outcomes and results
- Code changes and their reasoning
- Problems discovered and solved

## What to Strip
- Detailed tool invocation parameters
- Intermediate exploration steps
- File reading/writing mechanics
- Error messages that were resolved
- Verbose tool output

## Why This Matters

Memories should capture what was learned and decided, not how the learning process happened. This makes memories more actionable and concise for future sessions.

Example: Instead of recording "Read file X, then Read file Y, then Made edit Z", record "Discovered that pattern X should be refactored to use pattern Y because of performance reasons."
