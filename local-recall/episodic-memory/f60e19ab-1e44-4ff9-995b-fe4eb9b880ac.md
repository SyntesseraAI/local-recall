# Transcript Structure in Claude Projects

Claude Code transcripts are stored in JSONL format with a specific structure.

## File Format

Transcripts are stored in `transcripts/` directory as JSONL files:
- One JSON object per line
- Each object represents a transcript event
- Files may contain multiple events from a single session

## Event Structure

Each transcript event typically includes:
- `type`: Event type (e.g., "message", "tool_call", "result")
- `timestamp`: When the event occurred
- `content`: The actual event data
- Additional metadata depending on event type

## Processing Considerations

- Events are ordered chronologically within a file
- Multiple events from different timestamps may be in the same file
- The MCP server's background daemon reads and processes these files asynchronously
- Transcript processing is used for memory extraction and updating
