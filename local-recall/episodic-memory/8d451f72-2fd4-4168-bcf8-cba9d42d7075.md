The memory extraction system uses the Claude API (via the `@anthropic-ai/sdk`) to process transcripts and extract structured memories. The extraction is guided by a carefully crafted system prompt stored in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that instructs Claude to identify valuable information from session transcripts. This approach ensures consistent, high-quality memory extraction across different sessions and contexts.
