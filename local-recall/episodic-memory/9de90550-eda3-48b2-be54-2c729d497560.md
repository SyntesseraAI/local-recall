Local Recall uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for embeddings. Model automatically downloads to local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/ on first use (~133MB). First run takes 30-60 seconds, subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer.json not found error occurs, remove local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5* directory to force re-download.
