During a session transcript analysis, attempting to invoke `mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__memory_create` resulted in an error indicating the tool is not available. This suggests either the MCP server is not properly initialized, the tool naming convention may be incorrect, or the tool hasn't been properly registered with the system.
