# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full transcript path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line):
- Each line is a complete JSON object
- Objects contain turn/turn_id, timestamp, content, and other metadata
- Files are named with timestamps or sequential IDs

## Implementation Note

When implementing transcript collection, use `path.resolve()` and `path.dirname()` to handle path resolution consistently across platforms. The transcript collector should be aware of this naming convention when scanning Claude's project cache.
