# Memory Extraction Guidance Preference

The user prefers clear, concise guidance for memory extraction with:
- Well-organized sections (What was learned, What is known, etc.)
- Specific examples of what to extract and what not to extract
- Clear output format requirements
- Guidelines for scope determination (global vs file vs area)

## Format Preference

- Structured markdown with headers for each guidance section
- JSON output format clearly specified
- Examples of when to use each scope type
- DO/DO NOT lists for clarity

## Application

This guidance format is used for post-session memory extraction and should be applied consistently to all future transcript analysis.
