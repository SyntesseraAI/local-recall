Claude Code fetches plugins from GitHub repositories. The MCP server startup failure was caused by `local-recall-plugin/scripts/` being in .gitignore, so the plugin couldn't find the compiled hook scripts when Claude Code attempted to load it.

**Solution**: Remove the scripts directory from .gitignore so that the compiled hooks are available when the plugin is distributed via GitHub.

**Affected files**:
- `local-recall-plugin/.gitignore` - needs to whitelist `scripts/` directory
- `local-recall-plugin/scripts/` - must be git-tracked for plugin distribution

**Why this matters**: When distributing Claude Code plugins via NPM/GitHub, all runtime dependencies must be version-controlled. The plugin's hooks need to be available when Claude Code loads the plugin from the repository.
