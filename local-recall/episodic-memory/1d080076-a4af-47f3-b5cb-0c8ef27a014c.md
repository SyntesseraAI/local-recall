# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: Working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` directory:
- Path: `~/.claude/projects/<project-name>/transcripts/`
- File format: `.jsonl` (one JSON object per line)
- Files are organized by session and contain conversation history

## Relevance

This information is critical for the transcript-collector component which needs to:
1. Convert working directory paths to Claude's naming convention
2. Locate and read transcript files for memory extraction
3. Process JSONL format correctly
