# Claude Transcript File Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` with directory names that are URL-encoded versions of the project path.

## Path Format
- Base directory: `~/.claude/projects/`
- Directory name: URL-encoded version of the full project path
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users%2Fjoe%2FCode%2FSyntessera%2Flocal-recall`
- Transcript files are stored as `.jsonl` files within the project directory

## Relevance
This is critical for the transcript-collector to locate and process Claude Code transcripts correctly. The URL encoding must be considered when constructing file paths to access transcripts.

## Implementation Details
The transcript collector needs to:
1. URL-encode the project working directory path
2. Look for transcript files in `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/transcripts/`
3. Handle URL encoding/decoding consistently to avoid path mismatch issues
