Claude stores project session data in `~/.claude/projects/` with directory names that encode the project path. For example, a project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` has a corresponding directory named something like `Syntessera-local-recall-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`. The encoded directory name includes the project name and a unique session identifier. This is important when configuring the MCP server's `LOCAL_RECALL_DIR` environment variable or when setting up hooks that need to reference the correct project directory.
