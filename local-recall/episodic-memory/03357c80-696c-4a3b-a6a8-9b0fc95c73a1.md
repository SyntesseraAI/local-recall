# Memory Extraction Workflow

The Local Recall system extracts memories from user interactions to create persistent episodic memories.

## Process

1. Transcripts are collected from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/*/transcripts/`)
2. The MCP server daemon processes transcripts asynchronously
3. Memories are extracted from user prompts and assistant responses
4. Each memory is stored as a markdown file with YAML frontmatter
5. Memories are indexed for fast fuzzy search retrieval

## Keywords Extraction

The system uses Claude Haiku (`claude -p --model haiku`) to intelligently extract keywords from user prompts and session content, enabling fuzzy matching for relevant memory retrieval.

## Purpose

This allows future sessions to access context about previous work, patterns, and decisions made during earlier interactions with the codebase.
