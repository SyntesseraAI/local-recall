The memory extractor (src/core/memory-extractor.ts) uses Claude Haiku via streaming to efficiently extract memories from transcripts. This approach balances quality and performance by using the smaller, faster Haiku model for parsing transcripts. The extractor processes transcript content and uses structured prompts to identify and extract valuable memories in the expected format with metadata (subject, keywords, applies_to, content).
