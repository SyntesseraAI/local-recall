# Memory Extraction Best Practices

When extracting memories from transcripts, preserve the exact intent and reasoning of both user and Claude:

- Extract what the user was trying to accomplish, not just what they asked
- Preserve Claude's reasoning and explanations alongside the solution
- Include context about why certain approaches were chosen over alternatives
- Capture both successful attempts and failures with their explanations
- When condensing transcript content, maintain semantic meaning and important details

This ensures that future AI assistants understand not just what was done, but why it was done that way.
