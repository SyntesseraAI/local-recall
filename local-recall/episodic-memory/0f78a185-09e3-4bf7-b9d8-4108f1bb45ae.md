Memory extraction uses a carefully engineered system prompt that instructs Claude how to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. The prompt guides:
- What constitutes a valuable memory (learnings, patterns, bugs fixed, decisions)
- How to scope memories appropriately (global, file-specific, area-specific)
- What NOT to extract (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data)
- Memory metadata requirements (subject, keywords, applies_to, content)
