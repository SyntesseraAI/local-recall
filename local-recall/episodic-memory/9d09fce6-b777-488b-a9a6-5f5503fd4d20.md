# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with special character encoding:
- Spaces and special characters are URL-encoded
- Slashes are replaced with `_`
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`

## File Naming

Transcript files are named with timestamps:
- Format: `<timestamp>.jsonl`
- Stored in `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/transcripts/`
- Files are JSONL format (one JSON object per line)

## Relevance to Local Recall

The MCP server syncs transcripts from this location every 5 minutes to extract memories. This path is crucial for the background daemon functionality.
