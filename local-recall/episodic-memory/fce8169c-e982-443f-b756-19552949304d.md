Local Recall is organized as a Claude Code plugin with:
- Core memory management in `src/core/` (CRUD, indexing, search)
- Hooks in `src/hooks/` (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop) that execute as shell commands
- MCP server in `src/mcp-server/` exposing memory tools
- Memory storage in `local-recall/` directory with YAML frontmatter markdown files
- Build output in `scripts/` directory
- Plugin uses `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for relative paths
- dist directory contains compiled JavaScript bundles
