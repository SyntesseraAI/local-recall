The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku (via `claude -p` command) to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. It reads the memory extraction prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and sends transcript content to Claude for analysis. The extractor handles transcript parsing, batching for token limits, and memory file creation with proper deduplication based on content_hash and occurred_at timestamps.
