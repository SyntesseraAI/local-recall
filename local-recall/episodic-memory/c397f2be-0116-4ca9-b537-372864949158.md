# Multiple MCP Server Versions Running

## Problem
Multiple versions of the local-recall MCP server are running simultaneously in the Claude plugins cache:
- **0.1.6** (2 instances in ~/.claude/plugins/cache/) - contains `serializeMemory` function that creates markdown files
- **0.1.10** (in ~/.claude/plugins/cache/) - uses `EpisodicJsonlStore` for JSONL files
- Local dev version in dist/
- Another from local-recall-plugin/ directory

## Root Cause
After migration from markdown to JSONL format, old plugin cache versions (0.1.6) continue running and creating markdown files alongside the new JSONL system. The migration only checked for JSONL existence but didn't clean up stale processes or old plugin versions.

## Impact
- New markdown files are still being created with different UUIDs than migrated ones
- Git status shows 3281 deleted markdown files and 234 new untracked files
- The storage system is inconsistent: both JSONL and markdown files exist in episodic-memory/ and thinking-memory/ directories

## Solution
Kill all old MCP server processes and clear plugin cache for old versions. Ensure only the latest version (0.1.10+) is running. The local dist/ build will compile fresh code without the `serializeMemory` function.
