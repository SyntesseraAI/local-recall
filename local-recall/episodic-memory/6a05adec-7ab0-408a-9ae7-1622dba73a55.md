# Memory Extraction Process

When extracting memories from transcripts, follow these guidelines:

## Scope Selection (applies_to field)
- `global` - Applies to the entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:transcript-collector`)

## What to Extract
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations

## What NOT to Extract
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Output Format
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown code blocks)
- Each memory needs: subject, keywords, applies_to, content
- Keywords should be lowercase and specific (1-10 items)
- Subject should be max 200 characters
