# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the working directory path:
- Replace `/` with `_`
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`:
- Each session gets a unique transcript file
- Files are named with timestamps or UUIDs
- Format: newline-delimited JSON with message events

## Key Fields in Transcript

Each line is a JSON object with:
- `type`: Message type (e.g., "user", "assistant", "tool_result")
- `content`: The actual message or tool result
- `timestamp`: When the event occurred
- Tool-related events include execution details and results

This is important for the transcript-collector utility which needs to sync and process these files.
