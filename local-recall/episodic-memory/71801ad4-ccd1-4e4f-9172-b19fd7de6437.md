Processing raw transcripts directly leads to noisy and irrelevant memories. Condensing transcripts first improves memory extraction by:

1. Removing verbose dialogue and tool output
2. Extracting only key events (user requests, assistant actions, results)
3. Focusing on meaningful learnings rather than implementation details
4. Reducing token usage in the extraction process

The transcript-collector should condense transcripts before passing them to Claude for memory extraction.
