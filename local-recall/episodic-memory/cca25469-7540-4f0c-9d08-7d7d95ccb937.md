When extracting memories from transcripts, the extraction process should focus on:

- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

Memories should NOT include generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious/trivial information, sensitive data, or information that becomes outdated quickly.

This ensures the memory system only stores information that provides genuine value for future development sessions.
