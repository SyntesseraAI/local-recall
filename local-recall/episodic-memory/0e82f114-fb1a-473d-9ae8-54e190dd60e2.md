When analyzing transcripts for memories:
- All thinking blocks are saved as memories (even single-line)
- Only multiline answers are saved (content with 2+ lines)
- Memory subjects are generated as: first line if multiline text, first sentence (up to `.`) if single-line text
- This is implemented in `analyzeForMemories()` function which filters answers by `answer.split('\n').length > 1`
