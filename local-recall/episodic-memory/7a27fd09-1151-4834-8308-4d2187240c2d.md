# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes and leading/trailing dashes removed:

- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Storage

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory:
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`
- Format: Each line is a JSON object representing a transcript event
- Files: Named sequentially (e.g., `0.jsonl`, `1.jsonl`, etc.)

## Usage in Local Recall

The transcript collector needs to access these files to extract memories and build the keyword index. This path format is used to locate and read transcripts for memory extraction.
