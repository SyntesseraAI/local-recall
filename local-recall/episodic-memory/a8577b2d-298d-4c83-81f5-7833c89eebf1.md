# Transcript Condensing Strategy

Full transcripts can be very large and expensive to process with Claude API. The transcript-collector should condense transcripts before sending to Claude for memory extraction.

## Condensing Process

1. **Parse .jsonl format**: Each line is a JSON event object
2. **Summarize events**: Convert detailed tool results into concise summaries
   - Instead of full output: Show only key information
   - Tool calls: Capture the action and outcome
   - Result details: Extract only relevant findings
3. **Reduce token count**: Aim to shrink transcripts significantly
   - Raw transcripts can be 10k+ tokens
   - Goal: Reduce to 1-2k tokens for API processing
4. **Preserve context**: Keep enough detail so Claude can extract meaningful memories
   - User requests and intentions
   - What was accomplished
   - How problems were solved
   - Discoveries and learnings

## Implementation Notes

- The condensing happens BEFORE sending to Claude for memory extraction
- This reduces API costs and processing time
- Condensed format should be human-readable for debugging
