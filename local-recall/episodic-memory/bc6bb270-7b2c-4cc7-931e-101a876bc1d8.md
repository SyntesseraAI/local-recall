The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses `claude -p --model haiku` to process transcript content and extract meaningful keywords and memory information. This approach allows the system to intelligently identify what information from a session is worth storing as persistent memory. The haiku model is chosen for its efficiency in this keyword extraction task.
