Claude stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project folders use URL-encoded path format (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/` for `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`). Transaction logs are stored as individual files with UUID filenames (e.g., `086dd5...`). This is important for tools that need to access or sync transcript data across sessions.
