All new features must have:
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Documentation in `docs/` folder
- Updated existing docs when modifying functionality
- Tests covering both happy paths and edge cases

Memory files ARE version-controlled and will be committed to git. Use MCP tools rather than direct file manipulation.
