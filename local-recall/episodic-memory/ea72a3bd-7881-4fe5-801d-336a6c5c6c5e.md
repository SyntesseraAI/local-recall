The codebase no longer uses `better-sqlite3` anywhere. This was part of a migration from SQLite-based storage to Orama (pure JavaScript vector store) and file-based memory storage.

**Stale artifacts**: The plugin had old bundled hook files that still referenced `better-sqlite3`, which caused runtime errors when the hooks tried to execute. These have been removed.

**Current approach**: All memory operations use Orama for vector storage and Ollama for embeddings. No native SQLite bindings are needed.
