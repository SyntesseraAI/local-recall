The project previously used Orama (pure JavaScript) with JSON index files (`orama-*-index.json`). This has been migrated to **SQLite** with vector embeddings. Key changes:

- Vector store now uses SQLite database instead of JSON indexes
- Embeddings are stored in `memory_embeddings` table with `embedding MATCH` queries
- Files changed: `src/core/vector-store.ts` (core implementation)
- JSON index files are no longer used
- SQLite provides better scalability and query capabilities than JSON indexes

The gitignore and documentation have been updated to reflect this change.
