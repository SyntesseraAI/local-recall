The CLAUDE.md project documentation still references the old SQLite+sqlite-vec based vector store architecture and the hook-daemon HTTP communication pattern, even though the codebase has fully migrated to Orama (pure JavaScript vector store).

**Outdated References**:
- Hook-daemon architecture diagram and HTTP endpoint descriptions
- References to sqlite-vec native extension and "mutex lock failed" issues
- References to `http-server.ts` (deleted during migration)
- DaemonClient usage in hooks documentation
- Description of vector store as SQLite-backed

**Should Be Updated**: Documentation should reflect that Orama eliminated the need for the daemon architecture and native modules.
