The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API (via `@anthropic-ai/sdk`) to analyze transcripts and extract meaningful memories. It uses a structured prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides Claude to identify:

- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

The extraction process outputs memories in the standardized markdown format with YAML frontmatter containing metadata like id, subject, keywords, applies_to scope, occurred_at timestamp, and content_hash.
