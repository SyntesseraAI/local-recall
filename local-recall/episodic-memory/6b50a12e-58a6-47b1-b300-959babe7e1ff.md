Memory extraction timeout must be set to 10 minutes (600000ms) to accommodate:
- Large transcript processing
- Vector embedding generation via Ollama
- JSON validation and response formatting

The timeout is configured in the `DEFAULT_OPTIONS` constant and passed to the `callClaudeCLI` method. Previous 2-minute timeout was insufficient.
