Transcripts are condensed before being sent to the memory extraction API. This condensing step reduces token usage while preserving important information. The condensed format includes events like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, and `[Tool: Name]` with `[Result: OK/ERROR]` outcomes to maintain clarity about what happened during the session.
