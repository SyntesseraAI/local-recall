# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with names like:
- `20250101T120000-12345.jsonl` (timestamp-based naming)

Each line in the JSONL file is a JSON object representing a conversation event or tool invocation.

## Relevance

This is critical for the MCP background daemon that syncs and processes transcripts to extract memories. The daemon needs to monitor this specific location and parse transcript files to extract valuable memories.
