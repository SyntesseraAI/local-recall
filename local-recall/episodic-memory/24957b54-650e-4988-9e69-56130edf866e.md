Each memory is stored as a standalone markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash). Memory files are version-controlled in git within local-recall/episodic-memory/ and local-recall/thinking-memory/ directories. This design allows memories to be tracked alongside code.
