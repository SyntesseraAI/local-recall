# Current Refactoring Work

The project is undergoing a significant refactoring effort on the memory collection and extraction system.

## Changes in Progress

- Renaming of memory-related components and file organization
- Implementation of vector-store and embedding capabilities
- Modifications to how transcripts are collected and processed
- Updates to memory extraction logic

## Files Being Refactored

- `src/core/` - Core memory management system
- `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` - Memory extraction logic
- `src/core/memory.ts` - Memory CRUD operations
- `src/hooks/` - Hook implementations
- Integration and unit tests

## Current Branch

Branch: `claude/refactor-memory-collection-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u`

This suggests ongoing work by Claude assistants on improving memory collection mechanisms.
