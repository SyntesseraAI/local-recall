The memory extraction system uses the Claude API (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022 model) to analyze transcripts and extract semantically meaningful memories. Uses structured prompts from src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts to guide the extraction process. The extractor processes transcripts and returns memories in a standardized JSON format with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content fields.
