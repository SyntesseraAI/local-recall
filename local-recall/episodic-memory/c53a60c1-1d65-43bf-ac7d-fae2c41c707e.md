Current implementation stores JSONL files at root level (local-recall/episodic-000001.jsonl), but the expected design places them within their respective folders (local-recall/episodic-memory/episodic-000001.jsonl and local-recall/thinking-memory/thinking-000001.jsonl). This keeps all related files (markdown during transition, JSONL, and embeddings) organized together by type.
