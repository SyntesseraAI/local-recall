The project uses a dedicated `src/prompts/` directory to maintain structured prompts that guide the memory extraction process. This separation allows for:

- Maintaining prompt templates separate from extraction logic
- Easier updates to extraction criteria without touching core code
- Consistent messaging across memory extraction workflows
- Better maintainability and testability of prompt-based features

The memory extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` provides guidance for keyword generation and memory creation.
