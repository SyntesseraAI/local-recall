The `transcript-collector.ts` file has implemented transcript condensing functionality to prepare transcripts for memory extraction. This condensing process:

- Reduces verbose transcript content to essential information
- Preserves key events and decisions made during a session
- Makes transcripts more suitable for processing by memory extraction models
- Improves efficiency of the memory extraction process

This is part of the background MCP server daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously. The condensed format makes it easier for Claude to identify and extract valuable memories from session history.
