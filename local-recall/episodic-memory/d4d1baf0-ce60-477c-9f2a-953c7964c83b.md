Thinking memories store Claude's internal reasoning paired with the corresponding output, creating reusable examples of "how I thought → what I produced".

Format:
- `## Thought` section - Claude's internal reasoning/thinking block
- `## Output` section - The text response that followed the thinking

Extractions use 20 parallel workers to process thinking blocks from transcripts. Only thought-output pairs are stored (tool-only responses are skipped). This provides concrete examples of reasoning patterns that can be retrieved and applied to similar future tasks.
