The memory extraction system is designed to process Claude Code session transcripts and automatically extract valuable memories. The condensed transcript format includes:

- `[User]` events - User requests and questions
- `[Assistant]` events - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` events - Tool invocations with names
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` events - Outcomes of tool invocations

This structured format makes it easier for the AI to analyze what happened in the session and determine what should be remembered.
