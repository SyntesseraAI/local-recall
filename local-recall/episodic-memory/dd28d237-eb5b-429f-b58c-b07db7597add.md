The `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` file contains structured prompts that guide Claude Haiku's memory extraction process. These prompts are used by the MemoryExtractor to analyze transcripts and identify valuable memories that should be persisted.

The prompt system is designed to help Claude identify:
- What was learned during the session
- Important facts about the codebase
- Specific patterns and conventions
- Problems that were solved

This structured approach ensures consistent, high-quality memory extraction across all sessions.
