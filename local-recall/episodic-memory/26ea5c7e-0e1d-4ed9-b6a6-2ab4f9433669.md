# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The memory collection process in Local Recall uses transcript condensing as a key step:

1. Raw transcript is read from Claude's project transcripts directory
2. Transcript is condensed into simplified events (user prompts, assistant responses, tool invocations)
3. Condensed transcript is sent to Claude for memory extraction
4. Keywords are extracted from the transcript to identify searchable terms
5. Memories are created with these keywords for future searching

This condensing step is important because:
- Raw transcripts are very large and verbose
- Condensed format focuses on meaningful interactions
- Reduces token usage when processing with Claude
- Makes memory extraction more efficient and focused
