Claude Code transcripts have a different structure than initially expected:

- `content` is an **array of content blocks** (not a string)
- Each block has a `type` field: `"thinking"`, `"text"`, `"tool_use"`, `"tool_result"`, etc.
- Thinking blocks have a `thinking` field containing the reasoning
- Text blocks have a `text` field containing the response
- This matches the actual message format from Claude Code sessions

The transcript parser was updated to extract thinking from content blocks and normalize them into a flat structure for processing by other parts of the system.
