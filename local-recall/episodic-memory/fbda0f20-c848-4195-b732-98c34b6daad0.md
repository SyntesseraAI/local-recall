# User Search Preference

The user prefers using the TaskAgent with `subagent_type='general-purpose'` for complex file searches instead of direct Glob/Grep commands. This is more efficient and respects context limitations.

The user demonstrated this by asking to 'use the general-purpose agent' for finding specific code patterns or understanding how components work together.

When future assistants need to:
- Search for code patterns across multiple files
- Understand how different components interact
- Find where specific functionality is implemented

Consider using the Task tool with general-purpose agent rather than direct file searches.
