Before extracting memories from full transcripts, the system should first condense transcripts into simplified event format: [User] prompts, [Assistant] responses, [Tool: Name] invocations, and [Result] outcomes. This condensed format makes it easier to identify valuable memories and prevents noise from raw transcript data. The condensed transcript becomes input for memory extraction logic.
