The extraction prompt (`memory-extraction.ts`) instructs Claude on how to analyze transcripts and identify valuable memories. Key guidelines include:

**What to extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and project conventions
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**What NOT to extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

**Scope guidelines:**
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component/area

Each memory must include subject (max 200 chars), keywords (1-10, lowercase), applies_to scope, and detailed markdown content.
