The memory extraction process uses Claude Haiku model to analyze session transcripts and automatically generate memory objects. The implementation is in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` and uses a structured prompt system defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide Claude's generation of memories with appropriate keywords, subjects, and content.
