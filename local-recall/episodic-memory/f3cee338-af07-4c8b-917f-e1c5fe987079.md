The memory extraction process is driven by a detailed system prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. The prompt defines specific rules for what should and should not be extracted as memories, provides guidelines for scope selection (global, file-specific, area-specific), and specifies the JSON output format required. The prompt emphasizes being specific with file paths and function names, concise with focused concepts, and actionable for future assistants. It explicitly lists what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, performance considerations) and what to avoid (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, trivial information, sensitive data, outdated information).
