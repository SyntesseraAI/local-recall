The transcript collection process uses a two-stage synthetic filtering approach:
1. **Pre-copy filtering**: Check `isSyntheticFile()` before copying transcripts from Claude's cache to avoid unnecessary I/O
2. **Cleanup pass**: Run `cleanupTranscripts()` to remove any synthetic files that may have been copied previously

This dual approach handles edge cases while optimizing the common case of filtering synthetic transcripts early in the sync process.
