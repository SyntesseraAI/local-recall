The memory-extractor module uses the Claude API (via @anthropic-sdk) to analyze session transcripts and extract memories. It implements streaming responses to handle potentially large transcript content efficiently. The extraction process involves sending the condensed transcript to Claude with a specific prompt that guides the AI to identify valuable memories based on the project's conventions.
