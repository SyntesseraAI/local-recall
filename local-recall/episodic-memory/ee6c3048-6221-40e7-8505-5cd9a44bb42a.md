The `.gitignore` in `local-recall/` is auto-generated from a template, but it can also be manually edited. When the template is updated in the source code, the manual edits in the existing `.gitignore` may need to be re-applied. The template is in `src/core/index.ts` in the `generateGitignore()` function and should include all auto-generated files that shouldn't be committed.
