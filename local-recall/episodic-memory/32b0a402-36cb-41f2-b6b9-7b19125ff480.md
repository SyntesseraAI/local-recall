Local Recall uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The model is ~133MB and auto-downloads to `local_cache/` on first run (takes 30-60 seconds). Subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer cache becomes corrupted, delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to trigger re-download.
