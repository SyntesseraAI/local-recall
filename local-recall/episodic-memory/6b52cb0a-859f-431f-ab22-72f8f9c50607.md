The `memory-extractor.ts` module implements memory extraction from transcripts using a dedicated Claude prompt. The extraction process involves passing transcript content to Claude with a structured prompt that guides memory creation. This is used by the MCP server daemon to automatically process transcripts and create memories every 5 minutes.
