Claude Code stores transcript files in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The project folder name is the working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes (e.g., `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`). Transcript files are stored as JSONL files within this directory and contain the conversation history between user and Claude.
