The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku via the `claude -p` command to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. The system passes prompts from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to generate structured memory objects that are then stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter.
