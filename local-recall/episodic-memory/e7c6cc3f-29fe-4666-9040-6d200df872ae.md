The `MemoryExtractor` class in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` is a core module responsible for:
- Processing session transcripts to extract memories
- Managing the extraction pipeline
- Handling the integration between transcript input and memory creation

This is a central component in the memory system architecture that bridges raw transcripts and stored memories.
