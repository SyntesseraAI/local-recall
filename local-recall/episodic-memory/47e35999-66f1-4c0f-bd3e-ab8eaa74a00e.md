The MCP server runs a background daemon that syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`), processes them using `claude -p` to extract memories, and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection. When transcripts change, old memories are deleted and recreated. The daemon runs every 5 minutes and uses ProcessedLog to avoid reprocessing unchanged transcripts.
