The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses a prompt-based approach with the Claude API to analyze transcripts and extract meaningful memories. The extractor reads transcripts, sends them through Claude with a structured prompt, and parses the response to create memory objects. This approach allows for intelligent, context-aware memory creation rather than simple pattern matching.
