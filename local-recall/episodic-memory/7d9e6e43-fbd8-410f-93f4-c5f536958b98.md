The dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin maintains its own `config/hooks.json` and bundled hook scripts that can become out of sync with the main source code. When the main project's hooks are refactored (e.g., migrating from SQLite to Orama), the plugin's configuration and bundled files must be manually updated.

The plugin appears to bundle its own versions of hooks rather than using the main project's compiled output. This requires manual maintenance when architectures change.

Consider: For future plugin updates, ensure hooks.json and bundled scripts are regenerated from the current main source during plugin builds.
