Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions. Memories are stored as structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings for semantic search via the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model.

Key components:
- Memory Manager: CRD operations for memory files
- Vector Store: SQLite-backed semantic search using fastembed
- Hooks: SessionStart (load recent memories), UserPromptSubmit (semantic search), Stop (memory extraction)
- MCP Server: Exposes memory tools to MCP-compatible clients

Memories are version-controlled and shareable, with git-ignored SQLite database and logs.
