Investigation of 69,308 transcript lines found that Claude's API can log the same thinking block multiple times due to streaming artifacts, but there are no instances of true interleaved thinking (different thinking blocks separated by tool calls within a single message). All 14 cases of multiple thinking blocks had identical content (100% duplicates). The thinking-extractor correctly handles multiple blocks via `thinkingParts[]` array, but deduplication prevents redundant content in generated memories.
