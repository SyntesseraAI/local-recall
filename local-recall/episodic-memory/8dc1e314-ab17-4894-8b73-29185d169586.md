Local Recall is a plugin system that enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files stored locally in the repository. It includes:

- **Memory Management**: CRUD operations for memory files in `src/core/memory.ts`
- **Vector Store**: SQLite-backed semantic search with fastembed embeddings in `src/core/vector-store.ts`
- **Claude Code Hooks**: SessionStart (load recent memories), UserPromptSubmit (semantic search), Stop (disabled)
- **MCP Server**: Exposes memory tools to MCP-compatible clients

All memories are version-controllable and shareable among team members.
