Transcripts are condensed before being sent to Claude for memory extraction. The condensed format reduces token usage by transforming verbose transcript logs into a concise event-based format with entries like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result]`. This compression is critical for keeping API costs reasonable while still preserving the essential information needed for memory extraction.
