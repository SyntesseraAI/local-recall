Removed HTTP server code that exposed `/search/episodic` and `/search/thinking` endpoints. The daemon now only:

1. Runs periodic transcript syncing and processing
2. Maintains MCP tool interface for programmatic access
3. Uses file-based locking internally for safety

Hooks no longer depend on daemon being running - they use vector stores directly with their own file-based locking. This decouples hook execution from daemon health.
