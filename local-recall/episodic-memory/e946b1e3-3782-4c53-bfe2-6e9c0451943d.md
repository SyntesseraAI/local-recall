# Self-Referential Design

Local Recall is unique because it extracts memories from its own transcripts while being used to manage memories.

## How It Works

1. The MCP server daemon runs every 5 minutes
2. It reads transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
3. It processes these transcripts to extract memories
4. These memories are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` as markdown files

## Key Consideration

This means when working on Local Recall itself, the session transcripts will be analyzed and new memories created. This is the intended behavior - Local Recall should learn about itself through normal usage.
