# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

When extracting memories from large transcripts, the transcript should be condensed first to handle token limits efficiently.

## Why Condensing Matters

- Large transcripts can exceed Claude's token limits
- Condensing reduces token usage while preserving key information
- Condensed transcripts are more efficient for analysis

## Implementation Approach

The memory extraction process should:
1. Read the full transcript
2. Condense it to extract key events and turns (summarization)
3. Pass the condensed version to Claude for memory extraction
4. Use the condensed format in memory analysis

This approach ensures that even lengthy sessions can be processed efficiently without token limit issues.
