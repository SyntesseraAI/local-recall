Memories in local-recall support three scope formats in the applies_to field:
- `global` - Applies to the entire codebase
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/core/memory.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`)

This allows memories to be targeted appropriately based on their relevance.
