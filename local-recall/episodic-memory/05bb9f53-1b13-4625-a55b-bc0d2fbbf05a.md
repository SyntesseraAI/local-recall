Removed `ts-textrank` npm package and simplified the `generateSubject` function to:
- **Multi-line text**: Extract the first line
- **Single-line text**: Extract text up to the first period, or all text if no period exists

This simpler approach is more predictable and doesn't require external NLP dependencies.
