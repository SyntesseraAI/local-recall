The `analyzeForMemories` function filters out single-line responses because they're typically too brief to be useful memories. It checks `content.split('\n').length > 1` before creating memory entries. This is intentional behavior to avoid cluttering the memory store with trivial or single-sentence outputs.

When thinking messages are being extracted, the same filter applies - only multi-line thinking + output pairs are saved as thinking memories.
