Updated `CreateMemoryInput` and memory metadata schema:

- Added `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp): When the original conversation happened
- Added `content_hash` (16-char SHA-256): For deduplication
- Removed `updated_at` field (memories are immutable)
- Removed `timeWindow` from config schema

Dedup key: `occurred_at` + `content_hash` ensures same memory isn't created twice.
