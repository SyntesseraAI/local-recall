# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line), named by session ID:
- Example: `session-id-here.jsonl`
- Each line is a complete JSON object with event data

## Integration Notes

The transcript collector needs to:
1. Determine the project folder name by replacing `/` with `-` in the working directory
2. Look in `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/` for JSONL files
3. Parse each file line-by-line as separate JSON objects
4. Handle the case where the transcripts directory may not exist yet
