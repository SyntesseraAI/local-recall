# Memory Files as Version-Controlled Artifacts

Memory files stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` are intentionally version-controlled and committed to git.

## Rationale

- Memory files represent valuable knowledge gained about the codebase
- They should be shared across team members and CI/CD systems
- Version history provides an audit trail of discovered insights
- Team members benefit from memories created by previous sessions

## Git Configuration

The `.gitignore` at `local-recall/.gitignore` explicitly:
- **EXCLUDES** (tracks): `episodic-memory/` folder and memory markdown files
- **EXCLUDES** (ignores): `index.json` (auto-generated, rebuilt on demand)
- **EXCLUDES** (ignores): `recall.log` (debug logs)

## Contrast with Index and Logs

- `local-recall/index.json` - **Gitignored**, auto-generated from memory files
- `local-recall/recall.log` - **Gitignored**, debug output only
- `local-recall/episodic-memory/*.md` - **Version-controlled**, shared knowledge
