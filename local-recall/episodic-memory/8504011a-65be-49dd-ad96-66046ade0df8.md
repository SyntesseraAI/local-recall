Memory files are stored as markdown with YAML frontmatter in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`. Each file contains metadata: id (UUID), subject, keywords array, applies_to scope, occurred_at (ISO-8601), and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix). The content_hash enables deduplication by comparing against existing memories to avoid duplicates based on occurred_at and hash.
