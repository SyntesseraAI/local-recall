The memory-extraction.ts file contains prompts that guide Claude's memory extraction process:

1. **Extraction Guidelines**: Defines clear rules for what should and shouldn't be extracted as memories
2. **DO Extract**:
   - Architectural decisions and reasoning
   - Bug fixes and root cause analysis
   - Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
   - Configuration quirks or gotchas
   - User preferences discovered during sessions
   - Important component relationships
   - Performance considerations

3. **DO NOT Extract**:
   - Generic programming knowledge
   - Temporary debugging steps
   - Obvious or trivial information
   - Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
   - Quickly outdated information

4. **Memory Format Requirements**: Each extracted memory needs subject, keywords (lowercase, specific), applies_to scope, and markdown content.
