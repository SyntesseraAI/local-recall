The memory extraction system processes transcripts from Claude Code's project cache directory (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`). This allows the background daemon to automatically discover new session transcripts and extract memories from them asynchronously.

The extractor tracks processed transcripts using content hashes to detect changes and avoid reprocessing unchanged transcripts. When a transcript is modified, memories created from that transcript are deleted and recreated with the updated content.

This design enables the system to work transparently with Claude Code without requiring explicit user action for memory extraction.
