The extraction prompt is defined in a dedicated file to maintain consistency across all extraction points. The prompt is designed to return JSON with a 'memories' array, where each memory has: subject (one-line description), keywords (1-10 searchable terms), applies_to (scope), and content (markdown format). The prompt guides Claude to extract architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configurations, user preferences, component relationships, and performance considerations while avoiding generic knowledge and sensitive data.
