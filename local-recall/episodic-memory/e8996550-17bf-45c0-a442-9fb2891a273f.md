The vector store implementation uses better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search. Embeddings are generated using fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). Cosine distance scoring ranges 0.0-1.0, rounded to 2 decimal places. Results are sorted by score descending with recency tie-breaker for equal scores.
