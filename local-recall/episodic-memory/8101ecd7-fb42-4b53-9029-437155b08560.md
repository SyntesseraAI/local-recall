The memory system prevents duplicate memories by checking both occurred_at (timestamp) and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix) fields. Before creating a new memory, the system verifies it doesn't already exist by these markers. This prevents the same memory from being created multiple times across different transcript processing runs.
