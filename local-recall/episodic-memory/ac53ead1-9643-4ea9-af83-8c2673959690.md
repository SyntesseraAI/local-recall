The memory extraction uses a structured prompt system defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts that:

- Defines a comprehensive system message for the Claude model
- Instructs Claude to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories
- Specifies JSON output format for parsed memories
- Includes guidelines for what to extract and what to omit
- Uses the same memory format as the rest of the system (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, content)

The prompt emphasizes specificity, conciseness, and actionability when extracting memories from transcripts.
