The VectorStore uses better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension for efficient vector similarity search. Key operations: initialize() sets up database, add() adds memory with embedding, remove() deletes memory, search() performs similarity search, sync() syncs store with file-based memories. The memory.sqlite database is gitignored and auto-generated.
