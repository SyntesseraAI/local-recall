ThinkingJsonlStore extends JsonlStore with thinking-specific entries. Files use prefix 'thinking-' followed by 6-digit padding. Stores add/delete/embedding entries for thought+output memory pairs. Each memory add includes id, subject, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash, plus thought and output fields. Embedding entries store 768-dimensional vectors. Sequential file loading ensures proper entry replay order.
