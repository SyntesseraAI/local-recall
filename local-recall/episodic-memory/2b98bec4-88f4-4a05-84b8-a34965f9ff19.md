# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the working directory path. For example:
- Working dir: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

Path separators are replaced with hyphens, and the full absolute path becomes the folder name.

## Session Transcripts

Within each project folder, Claude stores:
- `transcripts/` - Directory containing individual session transcripts
- Session transcripts are JSON files with the naming pattern: `<session-id>.json`
- Each transcript contains the full conversation history for that session

## Relevance to Local Recall

The MCP server background daemon syncs transcripts from this location to extract memories. Understanding this path structure is important for:
- Debugging transcript loading issues
- Understanding where Claude stores session data
- Working with the transcript collection and memory extraction pipeline
