All new features must have corresponding unit tests in tests/unit/ and integration tests in tests/integration/. Documentation goes in docs/ folder. Must update existing docs when modifying functionality. Tests should cover happy paths and edge cases. API: npm run build, npm run dev (watch), npm run test, npm run test:unit, npm run test:integration, npm run mcp:start.
