The `.gitignore` in `local-recall/` is auto-generated and has specific rules:

- **Tracked in Git**: Memory markdown files in `episodic-memory/` directory
- **Gitignored**: `memory.sqlite` (auto-generated vector store), `recall.log` (debug log), `local_cache/` (embedding model)
- **Impact**: Team members can share and collaborate on discovered memories, while each developer has their own local vector store and cache

This design allows memories to be persistent artifacts in the codebase while keeping generated and temporary files local.
