Local Recall enables AI agents to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files stored in `local-recall/` directory. It provides:

- **Core Components**: Memory manager for CRUD operations, vector store (SQLite + fastembed), semantic search using BGE-small-en-v1.5 embeddings
- **Memory Format**: YAML frontmatter with fields: id (UUID), subject, keywords, applies_to (global/file/area scope), occurred_at (ISO-8601), content_hash (SHA-256 prefix)
- **Claude Code Integration**: SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks that inject relevant memories into Claude's context
- **MCP Server**: Exposes memory tools (create, get, search, list, rebuild) for any MCP-compatible client
- **Background Daemon**: Processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes via MCP server

All memory files are version-controlled in git, while memory.sqlite and recall.log are gitignored.
