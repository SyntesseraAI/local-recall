The Claude API has a rate limit of 5 hours per request window. When extracting keywords using the Claude Haiku model via `claude -p --model haiku`, if the rate limit is reached, the request will fail with a message indicating the limit has been reached and when it resets (e.g., 11pm Europe/London timezone).

This affects the user-prompt-submit hook which relies on keyword extraction for memory search functionality.
