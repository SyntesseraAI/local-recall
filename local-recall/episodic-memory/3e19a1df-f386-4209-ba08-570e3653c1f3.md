The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to analyze transcripts and extract memories. The system:

1. Takes transcript content as input
2. Uses a structured prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that instructs Claude to return JSON
3. Claude returns an array of memory objects with fields: subject, keywords, applies_to, content
4. The extracted memories are then validated and persisted

This approach leverages Haiku's efficiency for structured extraction tasks while maintaining output quality.
