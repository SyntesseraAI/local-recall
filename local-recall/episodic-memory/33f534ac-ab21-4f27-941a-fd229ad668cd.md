# Communication Style for CLI Environments

When working on this project, responses should be:
- **Short and concise** - CLI environments benefit from brief, focused output
- **Direct** - Get to the point quickly
- **Markdown-formatted** - Use Github-flavored markdown for CLI rendering
- **Monospace-friendly** - Output rendered in monospace font

## Key Principles

1. Avoid over-explanation for straightforward tasks
2. Skip unnecessary superlatives or emotional validation
3. Focus on factual, technical information
4. Use markdown headers and lists for clarity
5. Keep paragraphs short

## When NOT to Communicate

- Don't use bash commands as a means of communication
- Don't use code comments to explain things to users
- Don't echo/printf explanations through bash

Instead, output all explanation text directly in your response.
