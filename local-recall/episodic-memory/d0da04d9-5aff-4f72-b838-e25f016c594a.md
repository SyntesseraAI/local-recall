Local Recall enables Claude Code and MCP-compatible AI tools to store and retrieve contextual information across sessions through structured markdown files stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`. Memories are version-controlled, sharable, and include YAML frontmatter with metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash) plus markdown content. The system includes hooks for SessionStart (loads recent memories) and UserPromptSubmit (semantic search), plus an MCP server for tool-based memory management.
