# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts location: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

Each transcript is stored as a JSONL file with a UUID-based filename.

## File Format

Transcript files are in JSONL format (one JSON object per line), where each line contains:
- `type`: The event type (e.g., "user", "assistant", "tool", "result")
- `content`: The actual content of that event
- Other metadata fields as appropriate

This format allows efficient streaming and parsing of long transcripts without loading the entire file into memory.
