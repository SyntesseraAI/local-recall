Memories are deduplicated using two fields: `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp of when the original event occurred) and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix of content). The `findDuplicate()` method in memory.ts checks for existing memories with matching occurred_at and content_hash. This prevents duplicate memories from being created when the same event is processed multiple times.
