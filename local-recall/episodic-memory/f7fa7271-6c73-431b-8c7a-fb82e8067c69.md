# Memory Extraction Guidelines

## Should Extract
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations applied

## Should NOT Extract
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

Memories should be specific to this codebase and include concrete details like file paths and function names. Use appropriate scope: `global` for codebase-wide knowledge, `file:<path>` for file-specific info, `area:<name>` for component-specific knowledge.
