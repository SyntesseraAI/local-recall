When parsing JSONL transcript entries with content blocks, thinking blocks are structured as `{type: 'thinking', thinking: string}` - the property is named `thinking`, not `text`. The `extractThinkingFromBlocks()` function at `src/utils/transcript.ts:22-27` correctly filters for `block.type === 'thinking'` and accesses the `thinking` property. Any code processing thinking blocks must use this exact property name or the thinking content will be lost.
