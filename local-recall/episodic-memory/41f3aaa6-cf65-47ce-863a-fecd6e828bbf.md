# Communication Style Preference

The user (Joe) prefers:
- **Concise responses** - Short, direct answers without unnecessary elaboration
- **Direct approach** - Jump straight to the task at hand
- **Efficiency-focused** - Values time saved over detailed explanations
- **Action-oriented** - Prefers showing what was done over lengthy commentary

When working with this user:
- Keep responses brief and to the point
- Avoid verbose explanations unless specifically asked
- Focus on results and what was accomplished
- Save detailed explanations for complex or non-obvious changes
