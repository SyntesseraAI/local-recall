When memory extraction processes Claude responses that contain malformed or incomplete JSON objects, empty objects ({}) are created instead of being filtered out. This occurs during parsing of Claude's extracted memories. The issue manifests as memories with missing or invalid fields being stored in the episodic-memory directory.
