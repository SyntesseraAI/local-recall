The memory extraction prompt in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts defines the exact format Claude should use when extracting memories from transcripts:
- Memories must use YAML frontmatter with: id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash
- Each memory should focus on one concept
- Keywords should be lowercase and specific for searchability
- applies_to can be: global, file:<path>, or area:<name>
- The prompt guides Claude on what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, conventions) and what to avoid (generic knowledge, temporary steps, sensitive data)
