# Claude Transcript Storage Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts in a specific location based on the platform:

## macOS
Transcripts are stored at: `~/.claude/projects/`

## Path Naming Convention
The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Replace the leading path separator with nothing
- Replace all remaining path separators with underscores
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`

## File Format
Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (JSON Lines format) containing individual message objects.

This convention should be used when implementing transcript collection from Claude Code sessions.
