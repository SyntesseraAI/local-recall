Local Recall is a local markdown-powered memory system that enables Claude Code and other AI tools (via MCP) to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. All memories are stored locally within the repository, making them version-controllable and shareable among team members.

Core Components:
- **Memory Manager** (src/core/memory.ts): CRD operations for memory files
- **Vector Store** (src/core/vector-store.ts): SQLite-backed vector store using sqlite-vec extension and fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model
- **Search** (src/core/search.ts): Semantic search using vector embeddings
- **Hooks**: SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, and Stop hooks for integration with Claude Code
- **MCP Server**: Exposes memory tools to MCP-compatible clients

The project uses better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search, with cosine distance scoring (0.0 to 1.0) and recency tie-breaking.
