# Embedding and Vector Store Implementation Needed

The MCP server transcript processing pipeline requires:

1. **Embedding Module** (`src/core/embedding.ts`)
   - Use `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model
   - Batch embed memory content and transcript segments
   - Cache embeddings for performance

2. **Vector Store Module** (`src/core/vector-store.ts`)
   - Store embeddings in searchable format
   - Support semantic similarity search
   - Enable finding contextually relevant memories

## Current Status

These modules were scaffolded but not fully implemented. They are critical for:
- Processing transcripts to extract contextually relevant memories
- Finding similar memories to avoid duplicates
- Enabling semantic search beyond keyword matching
