The memory extraction system analyzes transcripts from Claude Code sessions to automatically identify and create valuable memories. The `memory-extractor.ts` module processes condensed transcript events (marked with `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, `[Result: OK/ERROR]`) to understand session context and extract actionable memories that will help future assistants working on the codebase.
