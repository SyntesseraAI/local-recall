Each memory file is stored as structured markdown with YAML frontmatter containing: `id` (unique UUID), `subject` (brief description), `keywords` (searchable terms), `applies_to` (scope: global/file/area), `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp), and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix for deduplication). This structure enables efficient searching, prevents duplicate memories, and maintains proper scoping of memories to their relevant contexts.
