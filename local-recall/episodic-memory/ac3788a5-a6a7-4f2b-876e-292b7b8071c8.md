# Memory Extraction with Claude Haiku

The memory extraction process uses Claude Haiku to extract keywords from transcript content.

## Implementation Details

- Claude Haiku is invoked via `claude -p --model haiku` to extract keywords
- This is used in the `UserPromptSubmit` hook to find relevant memories based on user prompts
- Haiku is chosen for keyword extraction due to its speed and efficiency
- The extracted keywords are then matched against the memory index using fuzzy matching

## Context

The CLAUDE.md documentation mentions this approach but the actual implementation details are in the hooks and memory extraction code.
