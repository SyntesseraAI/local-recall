The memory extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` provides detailed guidance to Claude on how to extract memories from transcripts. It specifies the JSON output format with fields: subject (one-line description), keywords (searchable terms), applies_to (scope), and content (detailed memory in markdown). The prompt includes instructions to be specific with file paths and function names, be concise with one concept per memory, and be actionable so future assistants can use the memories effectively.
