The memory extraction prompt is defined in a dedicated file at src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts. This file contains the structured prompt used to guide Claude Haiku in analyzing transcripts and extracting memories. The prompt format matches the LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL memory extraction guidelines, defining what should and shouldn't be extracted from transcripts.
