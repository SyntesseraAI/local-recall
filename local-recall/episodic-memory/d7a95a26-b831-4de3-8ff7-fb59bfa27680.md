The MemoryExtractor class (src/core/memory-extractor.ts, 478 lines) handles the core logic of extracting memories from transcripts using the Claude API. It receives condensed transcripts and uses Claude to identify valuable memories that should be persisted. The extracted memories are then created in the memory system.
