Claude Code fetches plugins from GitHub repositories. The MCP server startup failure was caused by `local-recall-plugin/scripts/` being in .gitignore, so the startup scripts were missing when Claude Code tried to load the plugin.

**Solution**: Remove `local-recall-plugin/scripts/` from .gitignore so that hook scripts are tracked in git. This allows Claude Code to find and execute:
- `local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/session-start.js`
- `local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/user-prompt-submit.js`
- `local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/stop.js`
- `local-recall-plugin/scripts/mcp-server/server.js`

**Key insight**: Any executable script that needs to be distributed as part of a GitHub-hosted plugin must be tracked in git, not ignored.
