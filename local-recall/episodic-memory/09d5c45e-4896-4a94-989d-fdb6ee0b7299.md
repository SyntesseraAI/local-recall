# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory with slashes replaced by dashes and special characters escaped:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

Inside each project folder:
- `transcripts/` - Contains `.jsonl` files with session transcripts
- Each transcript file is named sequentially (e.g., `transcript_0.jsonl`, `transcript_1.jsonl`)

## Relevance to Local Recall

The MCP server daemon processes these transcripts to extract memories asynchronously. Understanding the path format is critical for:
1. Locating transcript files programmatically
2. Converting between working directory paths and Claude's internal naming scheme
3. Properly syncing and monitoring transcript changes
