Each memory is stored as a markdown file in local-recall/episodic-memory/ with YAML frontmatter containing metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash). Memory files ARE version-controlled and should be committed to git. The index (local-recall/index.json) and logs are gitignored and auto-generated.
