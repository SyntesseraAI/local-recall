# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Folder Naming Convention

The project folder name uses the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → folder `_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`
- Transcripts stored in `~/.claude/projects/_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (`.jsonl` extension) with the naming pattern `transcript-*.jsonl`.

## Usage in Local Recall

The transcript collector uses this location to:
1. Monitor for new transcript files from Claude Code sessions
2. Extract memories and context from recent sessions
3. Build the memory index from session data

This is critical for the stop hook and MCP server daemon which need to find and process transcripts asynchronously.
