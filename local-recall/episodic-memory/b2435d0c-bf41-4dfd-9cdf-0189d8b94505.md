The memory extraction prompt in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts provides Claude with clear guidelines on what to extract from transcripts. It distinguishes between what SHOULD be extracted (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks) vs what SHOULD NOT be extracted (generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, sensitive data). The prompt emphasizes being specific, concise, and actionable with appropriate scoping (global, file:path, or area:name).
