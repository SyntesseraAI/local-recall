The memory extractor analyzes session transcripts and automatically extracts valuable memories that help future AI assistants. This runs as part of the MCP server daemon and processes transcripts asynchronously. The extraction uses Claude Haiku with a structured prompt to identify:
- What was learned or discovered
- Important architectural decisions
- Bug fixes and solutions
- Code patterns and conventions
- Configuration details and gotchas

Extracted memories are stored in the episodic-memory directory with proper metadata (keywords, scope, timestamp, content hash) to enable efficient searching and deduplication.
