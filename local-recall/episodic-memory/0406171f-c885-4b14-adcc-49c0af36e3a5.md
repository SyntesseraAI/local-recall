Fixed critical bug in transcript parsing where thinking content was being dropped. The issue was that `stop.ts` checked `c.text` for thinking blocks, but thinking blocks have a `c.thinking` property instead. The proper accessor is `c.thinking` for Claude's internal reasoning blocks. This caused the memory extraction system to miss important context during transcript analysis.
