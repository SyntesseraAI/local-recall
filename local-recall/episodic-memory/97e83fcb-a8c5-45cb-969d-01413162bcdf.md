# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the project's absolute path, with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format)
- Files are organized by session date and timestamp

## Important Details

- The transcript path is passed to hooks via the `transcript_path` parameter
- Transcripts are human-readable JSON Lines format, not binary
- Multiple transcripts may exist for the same project across different sessions
- The `transcript_path` provided to hooks points to the active session's transcript file
