The MCP server runs as a background daemon (every 5 minutes) to process transcripts and extract memories asynchronously. This prevents blocking the user's workflow. The Stop hook is disabled in favor of this background processing approach. Transcripts are synced from Claude's cache and processed to create new memories.
