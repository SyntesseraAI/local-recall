The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API with streaming to process transcripts. It sends condensed transcripts to Claude and receives memory candidates as a stream, parsing them incrementally. This approach is more efficient than non-streaming for handling potentially large transcript data.
