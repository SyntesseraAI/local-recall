Local Recall maintains separate vector indexes for episodic and thinking memories:
- `orama-episodic-index.json` - Vector index for episodic memories
- `orama-thinking-index.json` - Vector index for thinking memories

These indexes are built and maintained independently. Each memory type has its own:
- Vector store instance (episodic vs thinking)
- Search implementation
- Processing pipeline (transcript extraction for episodic, thinking block extraction for thinking)
- Configuration thresholds (episodicMinSimilarity vs thinkingMinSimilarity)

This separation allows independent configuration and retrieval of each memory type.
