The memory extraction process relies on carefully crafted prompts that guide Claude on what constitutes valuable memories. The prompts define specific guidelines:

- What should be extracted (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, user preferences, component relationships, performance optimizations)
- What should NOT be extracted (generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, sensitive data, outdated information)
- Required memory fields: subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and detailed content
- Emphasis on being specific (file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help future assistants)

The prompts emphasize proper scope selection (global, file:<path>, or area:<name>) and encourage semantic grouping of related information.
