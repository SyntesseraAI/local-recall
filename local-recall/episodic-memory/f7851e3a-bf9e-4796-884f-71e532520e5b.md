The MemoryExtractor class uses the Anthropic Claude API to extract memories from transcripts. It leverages prompt templates from src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts that guide Claude to extract structured memories with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content fields. The extraction process sends condensed transcripts to Claude for analysis and parses the returned JSON array of memories.
