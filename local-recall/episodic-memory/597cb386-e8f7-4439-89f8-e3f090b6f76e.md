The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku (via the claude API) to intelligently extract memories from session transcripts. The system:

1. Takes condensed transcript events as input
2. Uses a specialized prompt (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) to instruct Claude on how to generate memories
3. Sends the transcript to Claude Haiku for analysis
4. Parses the returned memories and creates memory files
5. Handles deduplication using content hashes and occurred_at timestamps

This approach allows AI assistants to automatically create valuable contextual memories without manual intervention, improving the quality and relevance of stored information.
