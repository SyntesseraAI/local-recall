Transcripts are condensed before being passed to the memory extraction prompt. This condensing step:
- Reduces the amount of data Claude needs to process
- Improves token efficiency by removing redundant or verbose content
- Makes transcripts easier for the model to analyze and extract relevant memories
- Is part of the preprocessing pipeline before memory creation

The condensed format uses markers like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]` to represent the session events in a compact form.
