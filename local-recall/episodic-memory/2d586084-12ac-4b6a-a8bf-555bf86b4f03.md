# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the full path to the project directory with all forward slashes replaced by dashes. For example:

- Project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`
- Transcript files: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON event per line) in this location.

## Important for Integration

When building transcript collectors or MCP servers that need to access Claude's cached transcripts, use this path format to construct the correct directory. This is especially important for the background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously.
