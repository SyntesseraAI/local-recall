The memory extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` provides Claude with specific guidelines for what constitutes valuable memories worth extracting from session transcripts. The prompt distinguishes between what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, user preferences) and what not to extract (generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information). This structure helps Claude create focused, actionable memories that will benefit future AI assistants working on the codebase.
