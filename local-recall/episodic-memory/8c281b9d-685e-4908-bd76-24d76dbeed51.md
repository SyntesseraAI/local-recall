Memory extraction prompts are centralized in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts rather than embedded in the memory-extractor module. This separation allows for easier prompt engineering and updates without modifying the core extraction logic. The prompt guides Claude on what constitutes valuable memories and enforces specific output formats.
