The transcript is condensed before being sent to Claude for memory extraction. This reduces token usage and noise by filtering to only relevant events (`[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool]` invocations, and `[Result]` outcomes). The condensed format follows: `[Event Type] event content`, making it easier for Claude to parse and extract meaningful memories.
