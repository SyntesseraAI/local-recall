# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with the following transformations:
- Forward slashes `/` are replaced with dashes `-`
- The leading slash is removed
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## Transcript Files

Within each project folder, transcripts are stored as JSONL files (JSON Lines format) in a `transcripts/` subdirectory.

## Relevance

This is important for the `transcript-collector.ts` module which needs to locate and process transcripts from Claude's cache directory to extract memories and train the memory system.
