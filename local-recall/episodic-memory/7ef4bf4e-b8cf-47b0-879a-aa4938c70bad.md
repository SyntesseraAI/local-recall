All new features must include:
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Documentation in `docs/` folder
- Updated existing docs when modifying functionality
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases

This ensures code quality and prevents regressions in the memory system.
