Memory extraction functionality uses a dedicated prompt template stored in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This file contains the system prompt and instructions that guide Claude in extracting valuable memories from session transcripts. The prompt provides guidelines for:
- What to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, user preferences)
- What NOT to extract (generic knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data)
- How to format memories with proper scope (global, file:path, area:name)

This separation of concerns makes it easier to refine extraction quality without modifying the extractor logic.
