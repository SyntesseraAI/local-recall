The transcript extraction system categorizes session events into four main types:
- `[User]` - User requests and questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool invocations

This structured format enables efficient memory extraction by focusing on meaningful interactions rather than raw transcript data.
