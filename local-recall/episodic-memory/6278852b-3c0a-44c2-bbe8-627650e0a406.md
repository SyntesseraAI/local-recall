When extracting memories from transcripts, prioritize:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered in the session
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations applied

Avoid extracting generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious/trivial information, sensitive data, and information that becomes outdated quickly.
