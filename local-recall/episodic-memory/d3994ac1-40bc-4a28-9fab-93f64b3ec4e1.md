Local Recall is a persistent memory layer that allows Claude Code and other AI tools (via MCP) to retain information across sessions. It stores memories as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory. The system uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search using vector embeddings. Memory files are version-controlled in git. The SQLite database (`memory.sqlite`) and embedding model cache are gitignored and auto-generated.
