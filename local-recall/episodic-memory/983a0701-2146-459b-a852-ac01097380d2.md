Memories are extracted using a prompt-based approach defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts. The extracted memories must follow the YAML frontmatter format with fields like id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, and content_hash. The extraction process validates and ensures all memories conform to this structure.
