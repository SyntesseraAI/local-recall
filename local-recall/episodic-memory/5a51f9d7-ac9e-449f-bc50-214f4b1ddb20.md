The transcript collector has been updated to filter transcripts during sync. Only transcripts containing thinking blocks (type: 'thinking' in content) are copied to the local recall directory. This excludes Haiku model transcripts which don't generate thinking blocks, reducing unnecessary storage and processing overhead.

Implementation details:
- `hasThinkingBlocks()` method checks for thinking content blocks in transcript JSON
- `syncTranscripts()` skips copying transcripts without thinking blocks
- `cleanupTranscripts()` removes existing transcripts that lack thinking blocks
- This is a storage optimization while maintaining thinking memory extraction capability
