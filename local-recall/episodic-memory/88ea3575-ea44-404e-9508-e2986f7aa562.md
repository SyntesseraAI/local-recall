# Architecture Migration: SQLite to Orama

Local Recall has migrated from SQLite with sqlite-vec extension to Orama for vector search.

## Why Orama?
- Pure JavaScript implementation (no native dependencies)
- Simplifies deployment and eliminates sqlite-vec compilation issues
- Works directly in hooks without daemon communication
- JSON-based index files are version-controllable

## Impact on Architecture
- Removed daemon architecture (http-server.ts, daemon-client.ts, database.ts)
- Hooks now work directly with Orama without HTTP communication
- Vector indexes stored as JSON files (orama-episodic-index.json, orama-thinking-index.json)
- Eliminates mutex and process isolation concerns that existed with daemon model

## Files Affected
- src/core/vector-store.ts: Complete rewrite for Orama API
- Removed: src/core/daemon-client.ts, src/core/http-server.ts, src/core/database.ts
- All hooks updated to use Orama directly

This change was completed in commit 91d7734.
