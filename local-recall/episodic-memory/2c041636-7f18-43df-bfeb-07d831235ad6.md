Claude Code stores transcript files in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The project folder name is the working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes (e.g., `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`). Each transcript file is named with a timestamp (e.g., `1733149200000.jsonl`) and contains JSONL formatted events. The `transcript-collector.ts` module handles discovering and reading these transcripts for memory extraction.
