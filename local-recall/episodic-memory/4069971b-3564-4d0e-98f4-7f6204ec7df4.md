Local Recall uses BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) which is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use. First run may take 30-60 seconds for download. Model is cached locally for subsequent runs. If tokenizer file error occurs, delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to force re-download.
