The memory extractor module uses Claude Haiku model via the `claude -p` command-line interface to analyze session transcripts and extract memories. This is more efficient than using larger models for the task of identifying and structuring memories from transcripts. The extractor processes transcripts asynchronously and creates memory files based on the extracted data.
