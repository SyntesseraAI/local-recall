MCP server runs a background daemon that processes transcripts from Claude's cache every 5 minutes. Daemon syncs transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`, extracts memories using `claude -p` command, and tracks processed transcripts with content hashes to detect changes. Stop hook is currently disabled in favor of this async daemon approach.
