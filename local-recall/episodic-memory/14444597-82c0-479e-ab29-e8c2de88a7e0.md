## Current Behavior
The thinking extractor (`src/core/thinking-extractor.ts:41-46`) extracts **all** thinking blocks from assistant messages without any content filtering:
- Simply iterates through all `type: 'thinking'` blocks in assistant messages
- Joins them without validation or filtering
- No filtering of low-quality, redundant, or irrelevant thinking

## Note
This is the current implementation. If future sessions need to filter thinking blocks (e.g., remove low-quality or repetitive thinking), this is where to add that logic.
