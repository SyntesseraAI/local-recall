The codebase includes transcript condensing functionality that summarizes Claude conversation transcripts before memory extraction. This reduces token usage, improves extraction quality by removing noise, and makes the extraction process more efficient. The condensed transcript format converts full dialogue into concise event-based entries (`[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool]`, `[Result]`).
