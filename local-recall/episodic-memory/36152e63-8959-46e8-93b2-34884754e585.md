The vector store is implemented in `src/core/vector-store.ts` using `better-sqlite3` with the `sqlite-vec` extension. Embeddings are generated using `fastembed` with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). Search results use cosine distance similarity scores (0.0-1.0 range, rounded to 2 decimal places). When scores are equal, recency (occurred_at) is used as a tie-breaker. The model is cached in `local_cache/` after first download.
