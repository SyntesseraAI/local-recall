Added comprehensive test coverage for field name normalization in memory extraction (lines 140-275):

- `normalizeMemoryFields()` helper function that mirrors production normalization logic
- Test suite covering alternative field names: `title` for `subject`, `tags` for `keywords`, `scope` for `applies_to`, `body` for `content`
- Tests verify partial field coverage works (e.g., mixed standard and alternative names)
- Tests verify invalid field combinations are rejected
- All 228 unit tests pass including new normalization tests

This ensures field normalization is robust and won't break on future Claude response format changes.
