# Transcript Condensing Strategy

To improve memory extraction efficiency, transcripts should be condensed before being sent to Claude for memory extraction.

## Why Condense

- Transcripts can grow very large (hundreds of KB) during long sessions
- Sending entire transcripts to Claude for analysis is expensive and slow
- Most of the transcript content (verbose tool outputs, repetitive interactions) is not relevant for memory creation

## Condensing Approach

Extract key events from the transcript:
- `[User]` - What the user asked
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude said or explained
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool calls

This reduces a typical transcript to 5-10% of its original size while preserving all meaningful information.

## Implementation

The transcript condensing should occur:
1. When a transcript is detected as changed (content hash differs)
2. Before sending to Claude for memory extraction
3. As part of the MCP server's background daemon

## Benefits

- Faster memory extraction
- Lower token costs
- More focused analysis by Claude
- Better memory quality (less noise)
