When extracting memories from Claude Code session transcripts, analyze condensed event format containing: [User] events (what was asked), [Assistant] events (responses/explanations), [Tool: Name] events (tool invocations like Read, Edit, Bash), and [Result: OK/ERROR] events (outcomes). Memories should focus on what was learned, known facts about the codebase, codebase-specific patterns, and problems solved.
