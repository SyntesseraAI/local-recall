Modified `buildMemoryExtractionPrompt()` to accept condensed transcript data instead of raw JSONL. The prompt now:

1. Receives `CondensedTranscript` objects with pre-parsed, filtered events
2. Works with structured event data rather than raw strings
3. Focuses on semantic analysis of condensed content
4. Still extracts comprehensive memories with proper scope and keywords

The prompt format remains similar but now expects data that's already been filtered for relevance, making token usage more efficient and allowing Claude to focus on memory quality rather than parsing raw transcripts.
