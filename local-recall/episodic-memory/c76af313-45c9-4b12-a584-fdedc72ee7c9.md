The project has migrated from Orama-based JSON indexes (`orama-episodic-index.json`, `orama-thinking-index.json`) to SQLite with the `vec` extension for vector storage. The implementation is in `src/core/vector-store.ts`.

Key changes:
- Vectors are stored in SQLite `memory_embeddings` table with `vec` extension
- Old documentation references to `orama-*-index.json` files are outdated
- The vector store interface (`VectorStore`) remains unchanged but implementation is now SQLite-based
- Search uses SQL vector operations (`embedding MATCH ?`) instead of Orama's JavaScript search
