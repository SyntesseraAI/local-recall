# Transcript Event Structure

Claude's JSONL transcript files contain different event types that represent the flow of a conversation:

## Event Types

1. **User Message Events**
   - Type: `"user_message"` or similar
   - Contains the user's prompt/input
   - May have associated metadata

2. **Assistant Message Events**
   - Type: `"assistant_message"` or similar
   - Contains Claude's response
   - May include text output and tool use descriptions

3. **Tool Invocation Events**
   - Type: `"tool_use"` or similar
   - Contains details about tools Claude invoked
   - Includes tool names, parameters, and results

## Parsing Considerations

- Each line in the JSONL file is a complete, valid JSON object
- Events are stored in chronological order
- Tool results are typically embedded within tool invocation events or as separate events
- The structure allows reconstructing the full conversation flow
