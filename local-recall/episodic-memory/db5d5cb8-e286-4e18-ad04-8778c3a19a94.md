Guidelines for what should be extracted into memories:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and the root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to this project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during the session
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations applied

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps that aren't useful long-term
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that would become outdated quickly

Memories should be specific with file paths and function names, actionable for future assistants, and concise focusing on one concept per memory.
