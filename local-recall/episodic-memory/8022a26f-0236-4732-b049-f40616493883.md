The memory extraction prompt must clearly state that the response should be:
1. ONLY valid JSON with no markdown formatting
2. ONLY valid JSON with no explanation or comments
3. Start directly with the JSON object

This is critical because the response is parsed as JSON without any text preprocessing. Any explanation before the JSON or markdown code blocks will cause parsing to fail.
