Memory extraction logic is implemented through a dedicated prompts file (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) that contains the system and user prompts used to instruct Claude on what memories to extract from transcripts. This separation of concerns keeps extraction logic maintainable and allows for iterative improvements to the extraction strategy.
