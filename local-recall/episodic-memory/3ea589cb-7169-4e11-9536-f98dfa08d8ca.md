Memory extraction happens asynchronously through the MCP server daemon, which processes transcripts every 5 minutes. This decoupled approach prevents blocking the hooks and allows for batched processing of multiple transcripts. The daemon tracks processed transcripts using content hashes to avoid redundant processing.
