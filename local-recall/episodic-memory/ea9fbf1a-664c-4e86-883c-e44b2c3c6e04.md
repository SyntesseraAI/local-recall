Claude Haiku is used for memory extraction because it:
- Processes quickly compared to larger models
- Has sufficient capability for transcript analysis and memory extraction
- Is cost-effective for frequent, routine extraction tasks
- Can be invoked via `claude -p --model haiku` command

The extraction prompt is designed to guide Haiku through structured analysis of transcripts, making it suitable for this task despite it being a smaller model.
