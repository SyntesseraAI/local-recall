# Memory Files Version Control

Memory files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` ARE tracked in git and should be committed like any other project file.

## File Organization

- **Memory files**: `local-recall/episodic-memory/*.md` - version-controlled, should be committed
- **Index cache**: `local-recall/index.json` - gitignored, auto-generated
- **Log file**: `local-recall/recall.log` - gitignored, debug output only

## Implications

Memory files persist across sessions and team members can benefit from accumulated project knowledge. This makes them suitable for architectural decisions, conventions, and documented solutions.
