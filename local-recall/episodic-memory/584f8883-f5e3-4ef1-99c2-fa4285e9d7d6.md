The `rake-pos` package installed in `node_modules/rake-pos/` has an ESM module resolution issue. When running hooks with Node.js v22, it throws `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error when trying to import from the package's dist folder. This occurs because the package's `package.json` export configuration may not properly support the import resolution path being used. The error occurs specifically when markdown parsing utilities try to import from `rake-pos`.
