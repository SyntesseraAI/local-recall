The Stop hook is disabled. Instead, the MCP server daemon runs in background every 5 minutes to sync transcripts from Claude's cache, process them using `claude -p` to extract memories, and track processed transcripts with content hashes. When transcripts change, corresponding memories are deleted and recreated.
