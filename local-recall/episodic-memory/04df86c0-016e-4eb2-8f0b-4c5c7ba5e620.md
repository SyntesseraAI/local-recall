Hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit) execute successfully but return empty stdout in Claude Code transcripts. Manual testing shows they work correctly and produce proper output. The hooks.json configuration in .claude/settings.json is valid, but the actual hook outputs are not appearing in transcripts. This suggests an environment-specific issue or a difference in how Claude Code executes hooks versus manual testing.
