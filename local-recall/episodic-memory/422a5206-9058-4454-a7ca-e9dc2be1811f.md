# Transcript Format is JSONL

Claude Code stores transcripts as JSONL (JSON Lines) format, NOT as a single JSON object.

## Format Details

- Each line contains one complete JSON object
- Objects are separated by newlines
- Each object represents a single message or interaction in the transcript

## Parsing Implications

When reading transcript files, must parse line-by-line rather than treating the entire file as a single JSON object. This affects how `TranscriptCollector` reads and processes transcript files.

## Common Mistake

Attempting to `JSON.parse()` the entire file content will fail because JSONL is not valid JSON. Must split by newlines and parse each line individually.
