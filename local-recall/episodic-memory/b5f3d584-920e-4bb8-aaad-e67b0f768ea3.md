Claude Code's plugin layer communicates with hooks via Unix sockets (or named pipes on Windows). Hooks are invoked as node processes that listen on a socket specified in the hook configuration. The hook output must be JSON with proper `hookSpecificOutput` structure. This is the mechanism by which local-recall injects context into Claude sessions at key moments (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit).
