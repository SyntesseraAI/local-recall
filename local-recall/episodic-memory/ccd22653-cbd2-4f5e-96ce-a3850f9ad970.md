The memory extraction prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` provides Claude with detailed guidelines for extracting valuable memories from condensed transcripts. It emphasizes:
- Being specific with file paths, function names, and concrete details
- Extracting architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and conventions
- Avoiding generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and trivial information
- Using appropriate scope (global, file:<path>, area:<name>) based on applicability
- Including actionable content that helps future assistants avoid mistakes
