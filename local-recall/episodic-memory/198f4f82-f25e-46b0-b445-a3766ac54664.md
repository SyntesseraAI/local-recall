# Claude Transcript File Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` with directory names that are URL-encoded versions of the project path.

## Path Format
- Base directory: `~/.claude/projects/`
- Directory name: URL-encoded project path (e.g., `file%3A%2F%2FUsers%2Fjoe%2FCode%2FSyntessera%2Flocal-recall`)
- Transcript files: Stored in `transcripts/` subdirectory with `.jsonl` format
- File naming: Uses millisecond timestamps (e.g., `1734110123456.jsonl`)

## Important Details
- Transcripts are JSONL files (one JSON object per line)
- Each line represents a message or tool call in the session
- The `transcript-collector.ts` module handles finding and reading these files
- Paths must be URL-encoded when constructing the directory path

## Usage in Local Recall
The transcript collector uses this path structure to:
1. Find the encoded project directory from the user's current working directory
2. Read transcript files to extract memories
3. Track processed transcripts using content hashes for deduplication
