The VS Code extension has different hook capabilities compared to the web-based Claude Code editor. The Stop hook specifically is not supported or not triggered in the VS Code extension environment. This affects automatic memory creation from transcripts.

Hook configuration for the plugin is defined in dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/config/hooks.json and .claude-plugin/plugin.json. Memory creation cannot rely solely on the Stop hook when supporting VS Code.
