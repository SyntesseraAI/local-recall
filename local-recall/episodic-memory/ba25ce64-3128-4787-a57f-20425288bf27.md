# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path, with each path component converted:
- Forward slashes (`/`) replaced with underscores (`_`)
- Dashes in original path components remain as dashes

**Example:**
Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
Transcripts stored at: `~/.claude/projects/Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

This is important for correctly constructing paths when searching for and processing transcripts programmatically.
