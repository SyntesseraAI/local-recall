# Transcript Processing Consideration

The MCP server daemon processes transcripts asynchronously. When extracting memories from transcripts, it's important to:

1. Avoid processing transcripts that are still being written to by active Claude sessions
2. Only process transcripts that are complete or have reached a stable state
3. Consider tracking transcript content hashes to detect when transcripts have been updated
4. Be cautious about extracting memories from incomplete data that may be in-progress

This is relevant because the Stop hook was disabled in favor of the MCP server daemon approach, which allows for better handling of transcript lifecycle and prevents premature memory extraction from incomplete sessions.
