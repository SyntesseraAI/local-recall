The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model via the `claude -p` command to intelligently parse session transcripts. The extraction uses a structured prompt defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides the model to identify and extract valuable memories from transcript content. This approach leverages Claude's natural language understanding to recognize patterns, decisions, and learnings that should be persisted.
