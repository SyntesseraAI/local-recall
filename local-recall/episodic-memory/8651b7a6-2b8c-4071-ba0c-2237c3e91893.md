# Claude Transcript Storage Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` with directory names that are URL-encoded versions of the project path.

## Path Format
- Base directory: `~/.claude/projects/`
- Directory name: URL-encoded project absolute path
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users%2Fjoe%2FCode%2FSyntessera%2Flocal-recall`
- Transcripts stored in: `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/transcripts/`

## File Format
Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) files, with one event per line.

## Significance
This is important for the MCP server background daemon which syncs transcripts from this cache location to extract memories.
