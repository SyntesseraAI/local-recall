# Memory Extraction Guidelines

When extracting memories, use appropriate scopes:

- **global** - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- **file:<path>** - Specific to a file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- **area:<name>** - Related to a component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`)

Memories should be:
- Specific with file paths, function names, and concrete details
- Concise, focusing on one concept per memory
- Actionable for future assistants to avoid mistakes and work efficiently

DO NOT extract generic knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, or sensitive data.
