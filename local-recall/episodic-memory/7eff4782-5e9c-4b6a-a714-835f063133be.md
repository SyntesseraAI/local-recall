The `.gitignore` file for the local-recall project should be created in the `local-recall/` directory root, not in `memories/` or other subdirectories. It should contain patterns to ignore:
- Generated index files (`orama-*.json`)
- Log files (`recall.log`, `processed-log.jsonl`)
- Local cache directories

The file is version-controlled and ensures that auto-generated files don't pollute the git repository while allowing hand-written memory files to be tracked.
