# Memory Extraction Guidelines

## DO Extract
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to this project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

## DO NOT Extract
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that would become outdated quickly

## Memory Quality Requirements
- Be specific: include file paths, function names, concrete details
- Be concise: focus on one concept per memory
- Be actionable: help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently
