When using Node.js `spawn()` with a `timeout` option, the process is killed with an AbortError. This error must be explicitly caught in the `error` event handler or wrapped in a timeout handler. Simply having a `close` event handler is not sufficient, as the AbortError will propagate as an unhandled promise rejection.

**Best practice**: Use a custom timeout wrapper with proper promise resolution guards rather than relying on the built-in spawn timeout option, as this provides better control over error handling and prevents race conditions.
