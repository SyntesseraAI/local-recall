The session-start hook correctly reads and outputs the 5 most recent memories from files, but there's uncertainty about whether these are actually injected into Claude's context. Hook outputs appear empty in transcripts despite working in manual testing. Verify that hook stdout is being properly captured and injected by Claude Code before assuming the hook itself is working correctly.
