The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to intelligently extract memories from transcripts. It leverages a structured prompt (in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) that guides the model to create well-formed memories with proper metadata. The extractor processes transcript data and returns memories with all required fields (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash).
