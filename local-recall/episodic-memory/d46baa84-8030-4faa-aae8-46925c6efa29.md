# User Prompt Submit Hook Improvements

Recent refactoring standardized string quotes and improved logging consistency:

## Changes Made

1. **Quote Standardization**: All string quotes standardized across the hook for consistency
2. **Logging Improvements**: Enhanced logging to provide clearer diagnostics about:
   - Which memories were searched
   - Search results and ranking
   - Extracted keywords from user prompts

## Impact

These changes make the hook:
- More maintainable and consistent with codebase style
- Easier to debug by providing better visibility into search operations
- Better for understanding how memories are being surfaced to Claude
