# User Keyword Extraction Preference

User provided a large block of text (appears to be transcript analysis instructions) and asked for keyword extraction, requesting:
- Only keywords as JSON array of strings
- No explanation, just the JSON array
- Efficient, concise response

This shows user preference for:
1. Minimal verbal overhead
2. Structured output (JSON)
3. Direct, actionable responses
4. Efficiency in working with large text blocks

When working with the user, favor quick extractions and structured output over lengthy explanations.
