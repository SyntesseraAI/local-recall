The system prevents duplicate memories by checking both the occurred_at timestamp and a SHA-256 content_hash prefix (16 characters). The findDuplicate function in memory.ts checks for existing memories with matching timestamps and hashes. This allows the system to safely reprocess transcripts without creating duplicate memory entries.
