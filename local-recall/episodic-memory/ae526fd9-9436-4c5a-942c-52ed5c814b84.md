Local Recall integrates with Claude Code via three hooks configured in hooks.json:

1. **SessionStart**: Loads all memories from disk, returns 5 most recent (sorted by occurred_at). Full reload, doesn't use vector store to avoid slow initialization.

2. **UserPromptSubmit**: Performs semantic search using vector embeddings on user's prompt. Vector store is lazily initialized and cached after first use.

3. **Stop**: Currently disabled. Memory extraction is handled asynchronously by the MCP server daemon every 5 minutes.

Hooks execute as shell commands receiving JSON via stdin.
