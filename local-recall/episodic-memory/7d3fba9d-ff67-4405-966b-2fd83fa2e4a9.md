Project requires Node.js 18+ and TypeScript 5.9+. Key scripts: npm run build (compile), npm run dev (watch mode), npm test (all tests), npm run lint, npm run mcp:start (start MCP server). Tests divided into unit (tests/unit/) and integration (tests/integration/) directories. All new features must have tests and documentation.
