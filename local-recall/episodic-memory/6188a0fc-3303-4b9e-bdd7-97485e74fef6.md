# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

Project folders are named using the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Contents

Each project folder contains:
- `transcripts/` - Directory containing individual transcript files
- Transcript files are in JSONL format (one JSON object per line)

This is useful for:
- Background daemons that need to locate and process transcripts
- Understanding how Claude Code organizes session data
- Building tools that interact with Claude's persistent data
