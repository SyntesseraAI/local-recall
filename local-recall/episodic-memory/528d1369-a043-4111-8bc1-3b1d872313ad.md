The SessionStart hook loads the 5 most recent memories (sorted by occurred_at) at the beginning of each Claude session. This provides context about the codebase and previous work to help Claude understand the project state. This is a full reload, not incremental, and intentionally avoids using the vector store to ensure fast initialization.
