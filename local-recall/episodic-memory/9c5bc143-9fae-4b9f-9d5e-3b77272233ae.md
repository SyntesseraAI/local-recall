When extracting memories from transcripts, the system must understand tool invocations ([Tool: Name] events) and their results. Memories should capture important discoveries like code patterns, architectural decisions, and bug fixes found during tool usage. The extraction process needs to understand which parts of the transcript are relevant for long-term memory versus temporary debugging steps.
