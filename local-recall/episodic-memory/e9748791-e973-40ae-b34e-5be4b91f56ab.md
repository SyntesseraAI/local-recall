# User Preferences - Documentation

The user has explicitly stated in their instructions:
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files
- Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user
- This applies to all markdown files unless specifically requested

This is an important preference to respect during development to avoid unnecessary file creation.
