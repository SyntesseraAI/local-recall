Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use and cached for subsequent runs. First startup may take 30-60 seconds while the model downloads.

Common issue: If seeing 'Tokenizer file not found' error, the cache is corrupted - solution is to delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` directory and let it re-download on next run.
