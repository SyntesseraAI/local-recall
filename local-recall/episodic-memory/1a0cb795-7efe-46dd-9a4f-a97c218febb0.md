When creating memories in this project:
- Keep memories atomic - one concept per memory file
- Use specific, relevant keywords for better searchability
- Apply appropriate scope: `global` (entire codebase), `file:<path>` (specific file), or `area:<name>` (component/area)
- Memory files ARE version-controlled and will be committed to git
- The index.json file is gitignored and auto-generated

This ensures future AI assistants can quickly find relevant context without needing to search the entire codebase.
