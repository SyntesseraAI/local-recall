# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Encoding

Project directories are encoded from absolute working directory paths:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes a directory under `~/.claude/projects/`
- The encoding replaces path separators with a special format
- Transcript files are stored as JSONL format within each project directory

## Accessing Transcripts

Transcripts can be accessed programmatically via hooks or the MCP server to extract memories and context for future sessions.
