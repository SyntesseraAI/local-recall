Updated `buildMemoryExtractionPrompt()` in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to:

1. **Accept condensed transcript data** instead of raw JSONL
2. **Reference the schema** in the prompt to help Claude understand the structure
3. **Include clear instructions** for identifying memory-worthy content
4. **Provide examples** of good vs. poor memory candidates
5. **Set expectations** about scope (global, file-specific, area-specific)

The condensed format makes the prompt more efficient while maintaining the ability to extract high-quality memories. The prompt now focuses Claude's attention on truly valuable information.
