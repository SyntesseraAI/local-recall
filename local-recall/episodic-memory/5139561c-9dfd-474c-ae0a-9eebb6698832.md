# Claude Project Transcripts Location and Naming

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Folder Naming Convention

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts are stored as JSONL files within these project folders
- Each transcript file contains a single JSON object per line

## Transcript Structure

Each transcript JSONL file contains entries with:
- `type`: Message type (e.g., "message", "tool_result")
- `content`: The actual message or result content
- `timestamp`: When the entry was created

This information is important for the transcript-collector component to locate and parse Claude's cached transcripts properly.
