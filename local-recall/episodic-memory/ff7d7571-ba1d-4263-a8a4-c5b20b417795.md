Memories should be: specific (include file paths and concrete details), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes). Scope types are: `global` (entire codebase), `file:<path>` (specific files), `area:<name>` (components). DO extract: architectural decisions, bug fixes with root cause, code patterns, config quirks, user preferences, component relationships. DO NOT extract: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging, obvious info, sensitive data, outdated information.
