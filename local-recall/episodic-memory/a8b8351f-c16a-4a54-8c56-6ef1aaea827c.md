The embedding model for semantic search is BGE-small-en-v1.5 from FastEmbed library. The model automatically downloads to `local_cache/` on first use (first startup takes 30-60 seconds). If tokenizer errors occur, the cache is corrupted and should be removed with `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to trigger re-download.
