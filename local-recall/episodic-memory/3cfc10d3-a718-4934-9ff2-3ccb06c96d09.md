When transcript collection fails in new repos, the issue is often visibility. The transcript collector already had debug-level logging, but those aren't shown by default. Added INFO-level logging at key points:

1. **Search initiation** - Log the search start and project path being searched
2. **Directory existence checks** - Log whether ~/.claude/projects exists
3. **Path construction** - Log the expected folder name (sanitized project path)
4. **Results** - Log how many transcripts were found (or 0 if none)
5. **Sync summary** - Log detailed summary of what was copied/updated

This makes troubleshooting missing transcripts much easier since users can see the exact paths being searched in `local-recall/recall.log`.
