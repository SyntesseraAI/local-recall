Local Recall uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. Model is automatically downloaded to local_cache/ on first use. First startup may take 30-60 seconds while downloading. Subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer file not found error occurs, remove corrupted cache with 'rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*' to force re-download.
