Three hooks are configured in hooks.json: SessionStart (loads 5 most recent memories on session start without vector store to avoid slow initialization), UserPromptSubmit (performs semantic search using vector embeddings when user submits prompt), and Stop hook (currently disabled - memory extraction handled by MCP daemon). Hooks use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} for script references and receive cwd via stdin to operate on user's project directory.
