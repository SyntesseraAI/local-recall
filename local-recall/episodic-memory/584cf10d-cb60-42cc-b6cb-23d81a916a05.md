Local Recall is a sophisticated memory system that allows Claude Code and other AI tools (via MCP) to retain information and context across sessions. All memories are stored locally in markdown files within the repository, making them version-controllable and shareable among team members.

Key architectural components:
- Core memory management in `src/core/` with CRUD operations
- Vector store using SQLite + BGE embeddings for semantic search
- Claude Code hooks for SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit events
- MCP server for exposing memory tools to compatible clients
- Background daemon that processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes
