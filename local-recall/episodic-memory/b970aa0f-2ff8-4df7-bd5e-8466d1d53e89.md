## Memory Search Debug Logging

Added detailed logging when memories are retrieved during hook execution.

### What Gets Logged
For each matched memory from semantic search, the following information is logged:
- Memory ID (filename without extension)
- Similarity score (as percentage)
- Memory subject/title

**Format**: `{id}.md | {similarity}% | "{subject}"`

### Location
- Episodic search: `src/hooks/user-prompt-submit.ts`
- Thinking search: `src/hooks/user-prompt-submit-thinking.ts`

### Purpose
Provides visibility into which memories were matched and how confident the similarity score is, useful for debugging memory retrieval quality and understanding what context was injected.
