The memory extraction system uses a structured prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that provides Claude with specific guidelines about:
- What constitutes valuable memories (architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configurations)
- What to exclude (generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging, sensitive data)
- Output requirements (JSON format with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content)
- Scope classification (global, file-specific, or area-specific)
