SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks run as independent shell command processes triggered by Claude Code events. These processes cannot share state and must use stateless approaches (like reading index files) rather than in-memory state or mutexes. This means each hook invocation loads the vector index from disk independently, which Orama supports efficiently.
