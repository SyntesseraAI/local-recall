Local Recall enables persistent memory storage across AI coding sessions. It uses markdown files with YAML frontmatter stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`, a SQLite vector database for semantic search, and FastEmbed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for embeddings. The system integrates with Claude Code via hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop) and provides MCP server tools. Memory files are version-controlled in git, while the vector database and embedding cache are gitignored.
