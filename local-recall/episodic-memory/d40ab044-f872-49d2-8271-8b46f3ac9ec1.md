# User Preferences for Code Changes

## Commit Message Format

The user prefers descriptive commit messages that explain the "why" rather than just the "what":
- Focus on reasoning behind changes
- Keep messages concise (1-2 sentences)
- Include meaningful context about the change

## Code Change Philosophy

- **Avoid over-engineering**: Only make changes directly requested or clearly necessary
- **Don't refactor unnecessarily**: A bug fix doesn't require cleaning up surrounding code
- **Skip unnecessary features**: A simple feature doesn't need extra configurability
- **Minimize documentation**: Don't add docstrings/comments unless logic isn't self-evident
- **Trust internal code**: Don't add error handling for scenarios that can't happen
- **No premature abstractions**: Don't create helpers for one-time operations

## Workflow Preferences

- User works on feature branches (e.g., `claude/refactor-...`)
- Regular git commits with clear messages
- Code should be kept simple and focused
