When extracting memories from transcripts, the system needs to parse tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.) and their outcomes. Tool calls provide context about what the assistant attempted to do, and their results indicate success or failure. This information should be condensed into valuable memories about code changes, findings, and solutions discovered during the session.
