During sessions, AI assistants can observe and learn about user preferences like: code formatting preferences, architectural choices, error handling conventions, naming patterns, testing requirements, documentation standards, and tool usage patterns. These should be captured as global memories so future sessions benefit from understanding the user's style and expectations without having to ask or infer them.
