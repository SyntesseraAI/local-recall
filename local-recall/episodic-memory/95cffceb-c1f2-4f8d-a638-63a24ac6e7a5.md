# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files within the project folder:
- Each line is a JSON object representing one event in the transcript
- Filenames are based on session timestamps or IDs
- The MCP server and transcript collector use this path to process transcripts asynchronously

## Usage

The `transcript-collector.ts` module reads from this location to extract memories and build the local-recall system.
