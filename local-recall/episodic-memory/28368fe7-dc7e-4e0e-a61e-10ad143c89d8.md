User explicitly does not want a dedicated embedding daemon in the local-recall package, as it would conflict when running multiple Claude instances (each instance would try to start its own daemon). Instead, user prefers embedding solution that is npm-installable and can be shared across instances without port/process conflicts. Ollama (external daemon) works because it's a separate service designed for concurrent clients, unlike an in-process daemon.
