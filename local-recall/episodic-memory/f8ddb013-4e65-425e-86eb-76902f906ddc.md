Memory retrieval uses a three-level search strategy:
1. Fuzzy keyword matching against memory keywords
2. Subject line searching
3. Scope-based filtering
- Minimum fuzzy match threshold: 0.6 (configurable)
- Index stored at `local-recall/index.json` (gitignored)
- Index is auto-generated and rebuilt on demand
- Supports semantic search capabilities with embedding model
