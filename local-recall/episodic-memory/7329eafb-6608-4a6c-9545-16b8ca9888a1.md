The memory extraction prompt logic is maintained in a separate file at src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts rather than being inline in memory-extractor.ts. This separation follows the project's pattern of keeping prompts modular and easy to maintain. The prompt file contains the detailed instructions for Claude to analyze transcripts and extract structured memory objects.
