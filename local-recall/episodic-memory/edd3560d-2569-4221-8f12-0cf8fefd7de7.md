# User Communication Preferences

The user prefers clear, explicit output from tool operations rather than procedural chaining of multiple operations in sequence. When performing tasks:

- Don't chain bash commands together
- Don't use tool results to implicitly drive subsequent operations without explicitly showing the user
- Show tool output clearly
- Execute operations step-by-step with visibility

This preference helps maintain clarity and allows the user to understand exactly what is happening at each step.
