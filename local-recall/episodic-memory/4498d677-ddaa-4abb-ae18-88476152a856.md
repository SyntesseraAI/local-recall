The local-recall plugin deploys to `~/.claude/plugins/cache/local-recall-marketplace/local-recall/{version}/` where `{version}` is the version number in plugin.json. Other Claude instances that install the plugin will use this cached deployment. The build script must bundle all dependencies into the MCP server (no `--external` flag) since node_modules are not shipped with the plugin. Version bumps force fresh deployments and invalidate old cached versions.
