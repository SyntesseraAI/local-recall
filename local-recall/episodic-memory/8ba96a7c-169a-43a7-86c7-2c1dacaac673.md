The user has demonstrated a strong preference for minimal, focused implementation. Key principles:
- Only implement what was explicitly requested
- Avoid unnecessary refactoring or cleanup
- Don't add features beyond the scope
- Don't add docstrings or comments unless logic is unclear
- Trust internal code and framework guarantees
- Don't create helpers or utilities for one-time operations
- Delete unused code completely rather than renaming with underscores

This philosophy should guide all future work on this codebase.
