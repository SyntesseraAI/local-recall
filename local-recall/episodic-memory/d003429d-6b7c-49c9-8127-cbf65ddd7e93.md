The `getIndex()` method now calls `ensureGitignore()` every time it's invoked (line 99), ensuring the `.gitignore` file is created or updated on each session start. This guarantees the file persists even if the index.json already exists from a previous session.

Previously, `ensureGitignore()` was only called during `buildIndex()` (when creating a new index), so existing projects wouldn't get the `.gitignore` file if their index already existed.

The `.gitignore` file ignores:
- `orama-episodic-index.json`
- `orama-thinking-index.json`
- `recall.log`
