# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line) where:
- Each line is a tool invocation with method, params, and result
- Timestamps may be inferred from the sequence
- This format allows for easy streaming and processing

## Relevance to Local Recall

This discovery is crucial for the transcript-collector component which needs to:
1. Find transcripts for the current working directory
2. Read and parse JSONL format correctly
3. Extract memory-relevant information from tool invocations and results
