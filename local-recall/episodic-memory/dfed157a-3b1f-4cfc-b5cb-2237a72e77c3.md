The file `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/user-prompt-submit-thinking.js` is a stale artifact from before the Orama migration. It tries to import `better-sqlite3` which causes 'ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND' errors when the plugin is loaded. This file should be removed from the plugin distribution and hooks.json should be updated to use only `user-prompt-submit.js`.
