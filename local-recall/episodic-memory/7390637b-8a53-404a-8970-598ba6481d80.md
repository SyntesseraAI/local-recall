Local Recall uses the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model from fastembed for semantic embeddings. The model (~133MB) automatically downloads to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use. Initial startup takes 30-60 seconds for download. Subsequent runs load from cache. If the tokenizer.json file is missing, the cache may be corrupted and should be removed to trigger re-download.
