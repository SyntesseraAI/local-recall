The memory extraction process in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku with a system prompt to extract keywords from transcripts. The system prompt is defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and guides the model to generate consistent, searchable keywords from session content. This approach ensures uniform keyword generation across all extracted memories.
