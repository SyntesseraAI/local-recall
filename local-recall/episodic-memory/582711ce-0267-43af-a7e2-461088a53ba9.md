The memory extractor uses Claude Haiku (fast, cost-effective) to process transcripts and generate memories. It leverages a system prompt (defined in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) that guides the model to extract relevant memories from transcript content. This approach prioritizes speed and cost efficiency while maintaining quality of extracted memories.
