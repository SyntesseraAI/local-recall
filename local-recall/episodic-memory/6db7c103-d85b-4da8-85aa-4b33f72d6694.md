Debug logging in findClaudeProjectDir() is helpful for identifying why transcripts aren't being found. Key log messages: 'Claude project found but no transcripts folder' (path found but wrong subfolder assumption), 'Found Claude project via path convention' (successful discovery). Check recall.log to troubleshoot project discovery failures.
