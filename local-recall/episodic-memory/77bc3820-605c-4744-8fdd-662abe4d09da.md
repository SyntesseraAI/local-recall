The memory extraction prompt is kept in a separate file (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) from the extraction logic in `memory-extractor.ts`. This separation allows for easy modification of the extraction criteria and prompt without touching the extraction implementation. The prompt guides Claude to identify specific types of memories valuable for future sessions.
