The default log level in `getMinLogLevel()` function was changed from 'info' to 'error' to minimize log noise in production environments. Users can override this by setting the `LOCAL_RECALL_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to 'debug', 'info', or 'warn' as needed. This aligns with the CLAUDE.md configuration documentation which lists the default log level as 'error'.
