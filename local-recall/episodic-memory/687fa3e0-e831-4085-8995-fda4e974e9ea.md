# Transcript Collector Error Handling

The transcript collector needs to gracefully handle cases where:
1. The projects directory doesn't exist yet (`~/.claude/projects/` may not exist initially)
2. A specific project directory doesn't exist
3. The transcripts subdirectory is missing

## Implementation

Use `fs.existsSync()` to check paths before reading, and skip gracefully with empty arrays when directories don't exist rather than throwing errors. This ensures the system works even on fresh Claude installations.
