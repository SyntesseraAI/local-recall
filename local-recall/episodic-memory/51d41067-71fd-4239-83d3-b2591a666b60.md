Memory extraction logic is driven by a dedicated prompt template file at src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts. This file contains the system prompts and instructions used to guide Claude Haiku in analyzing transcripts and determining what should be stored as memories. Future modifications to extraction behavior should target this file.
