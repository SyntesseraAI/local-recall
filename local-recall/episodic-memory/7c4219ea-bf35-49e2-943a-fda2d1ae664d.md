Local Recall switched from sqlite-vec to Orama as the vector store backend. Orama is a pure JavaScript vector database that works directly in Node.js without native dependencies or threading issues. It stores indexes as JSON files (`orama-episodic-index.json`, `orama-thinking-index.json`) that are gitignored. Uses Ollama for generating embeddings (nomic-embed-text model, 768 dimensions). Eliminates concurrency problems that plagued sqlite-vec.
