The memory extractor's `callClaudeCLI` method (line 75-128) was updated to use the Haiku model by adding `--model haiku` to the Claude CLI arguments. Haiku successfully extracts valid memories from transcripts with the same quality as Sonnet but at ~20x lower cost and faster execution. All 32 unit tests pass with this change. The existing `stripMarkdownCodeBlocks` method already handles Haiku's markdown-wrapped responses correctly.
