The memory-extractor module uses the Anthropic Claude API (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022 model) with streaming to process transcripts and extract memories. The extraction is driven by a system prompt that guides Claude to identify valuable memories from session transcripts. Streaming is used for efficient token handling and to avoid timeout issues with large transcripts.
