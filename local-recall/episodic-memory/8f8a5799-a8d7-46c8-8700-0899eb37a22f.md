The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude's API (model specified in environment or defaulting to claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) to extract memories from transcripts. It uses a prompt template from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that instructs Claude to analyze condensed transcripts and extract valuable memories in JSON format. The extractor is designed to work with condensed transcript format containing [User], [Assistant], and [Tool] events.
