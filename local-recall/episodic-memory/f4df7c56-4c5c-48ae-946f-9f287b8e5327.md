Successfully completed removal of IndexManager and fixed vector store issues. Full test suite now passes: unit tests and integration tests all green. Key test files updated: tests/integration/memory-lifecycle.test.ts (changed from IndexManager to VectorStore assertions), tests/unit/core/memory-extractor.test.ts (removed IndexManager mocks).
