# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Naming Convention

The project folder name is derived from the absolute work directory path:
- Path separators (`/`) are converted to underscores (`_`)
- The leading slash is removed
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`

## Transcript Files

Transcript files are stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) format inside the project folder:
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/{converted-path}/transcripts/`
- Format: One JSON object per line
- Each line represents a single message or event in the transcript

## Implementation Notes

When building transcript collectors or integrations with Claude Code:
1. Account for the path conversion logic when constructing paths
2. Handle the `.jsonl` format correctly - each line is independent JSON
3. Parse transcripts by reading line-by-line rather than treating as a single JSON document
4. Cache or index transcripts for efficient access
