The `memory-extraction.ts` file contains the prompt template used by the memory-extractor to guide Claude's analysis. This centralized approach ensures:

- Consistent extraction logic across all session transcripts
- Easy updates to extraction criteria without modifying extractor code
- Clear guidelines for what constitutes valuable memories
- Proper handling of scope (global, file:path, area:name)

The prompt guides extraction to focus on architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and configuration gotchas while avoiding generic knowledge and sensitive data.
