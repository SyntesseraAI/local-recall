The vector store uses `better-sqlite3` with the `sqlite-vec` extension for vector similarity search. Core methods include: initialize() (setup and load sqlite-vec), add(memory) (add with embeddings), remove(id), search(query, options) (semantic similarity search), and sync(memories) (sync store with file-based memories). The store is lazily initialized on first use by UserPromptSubmit hook.
