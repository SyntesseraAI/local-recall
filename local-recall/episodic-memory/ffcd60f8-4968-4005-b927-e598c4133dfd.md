The Stop hook **does fire in VS Code** despite initial uncertainty. Verified in recall.log that the Stop hook fired on 2025-11-29 and successfully created 9 memories from the previous session transcript. This confirms all three hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, and Stop) are functioning correctly in the VS Code environment.
