# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory:
- The working directory path is hashed (appears to use SHA or similar)
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `~/.claude/projects/4eadd9d2e0c5b5e5/`
- Transcripts are stored in JSONL format (newline-delimited JSON)
- File pattern: `transcripts/*.jsonl`

## Key Detail

The hash is deterministic - the same working directory always produces the same hash. This is important for:
- Reliably locating transcripts for a specific project
- Implementing transcript collectors that need to find Claude's cache
- Syncing transcripts across sessions

This is used by Local Recall's `transcript-collector.ts` to find and process Claude's project transcripts.
