The local-recall system processes session transcripts asynchronously to create memories. The workflow is:

1. Claude Code sessions generate transcripts stored in `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
2. The MCP server daemon detects changes to transcripts
3. For changed transcripts, the memory extraction system analyzes them
4. Claude Haiku extracts keywords and metadata
5. Structured memories are created and stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`

This automated approach means memories are created without manual intervention from users or developers.
