# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full transcript path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files with `.jsonl` extension, one event per line.

## Usage

This location is important for the MCP server and transcript-collector which need to sync transcripts from Claude's cache for memory extraction.
