Development requirements per CLAUDE.md: All new features must have unit tests in `tests/unit/` and integration tests in `tests/integration/`. Documentation must be in `docs/` folder. Update existing docs when modifying functionality. Tests should cover happy paths and edge cases. This is a mandatory requirement for contributions.
