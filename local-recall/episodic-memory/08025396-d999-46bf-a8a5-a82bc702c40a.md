# UserPromptSubmit Hook Memory Integration

The UserPromptSubmit hook in local-recall receives a special `# Local Recall: Relevant Memories` section that includes:

1. Previously extracted memories most relevant to the current user prompt
2. Memory metadata including:
   - Memory ID (UUID)
   - Scope (global, file-specific, or area-specific)
   - Keywords associated with the memory
   - Occurred timestamp (ISO-8601 format)
   - Similarity score (percentage match to current context)

3. Memory content in markdown format

This allows Claude to access contextual knowledge from previous sessions before processing user prompts, improving the quality and consistency of responses across sessions.
