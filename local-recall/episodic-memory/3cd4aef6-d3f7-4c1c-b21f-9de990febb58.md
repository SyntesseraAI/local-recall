# Recent Memory Creation Spike

The git status shows 400+ new memory files (untracked) across both episodic and thinking memory directories:

**Episodic memories**: Approximately 200+ new files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`
**Thinking memories**: Approximately 200+ new files in `local-recall/thinking-memory/`

These represent newly extracted memories that haven't been staged yet. This suggests:
1. Recent transcript processing has been extracting memories at scale
2. The memory extraction system (transcript-collector, memory-extractor) is working actively
3. These memories are ready to be added to the git repository once reviewed

The volume indicates the system is creating meaningful, extractable memories from Claude Code sessions.
