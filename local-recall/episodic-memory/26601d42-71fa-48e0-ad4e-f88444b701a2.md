Memory markdown files in local-recall/episodic-memory/ are version-controlled and committed to git. However, local-recall/memory.sqlite database is auto-generated and gitignored. The .gitignore file also excludes recall.log. This allows sharing memory knowledge across team members while keeping database and logs local.
