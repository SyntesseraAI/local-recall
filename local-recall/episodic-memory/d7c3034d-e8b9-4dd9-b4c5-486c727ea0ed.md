# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Naming Convention

The project folder name is derived from the file system path:
- Forward slashes `/` are converted to hyphens `-`
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `users-joe-code-syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path pattern: `~/.claude/projects/{path-with-slashes-as-hyphens}/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files in the transcripts folder with timestamp-based naming.

## Implications for transcript-collector

When implementing transcript collection:
1. Must reconstruct the project folder name by converting forward slashes to hyphens
2. Must handle the standard Claude transcript directory structure
3. The path transformation is deterministic and reversible
4. Use absolute paths from working directory to determine the correct transcript folder
