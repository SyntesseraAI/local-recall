# Session Start Hook Behavior

When a Claude Code session begins:

1. The `SessionStart` hook is triggered automatically by Claude Code
2. The hook loads all memories from disk via `MemoryManager.listMemories()`
3. It returns the 5 most recent memories (sorted by `occurred_at` timestamp)
4. These memories are injected into Claude's context window

## Key Points

- This is a full reload, not incremental
- The vector store is NOT used during session start to avoid slow initialization
- Only the 5 most recent memories are included (not all memories)
- Memories are ranked by `occurred_at` field for recency
- This happens before Claude sees any user input
