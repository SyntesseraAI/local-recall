# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS (and similar location on other OSes).

## Path Format

Project folders are named by converting the absolute working directory path:
- Forward slashes `/` are replaced with dashes `-`
- Other special characters are also converted
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## File Structure

Each project folder contains:
- `transcripts/` - Directory with JSONL transcript files
- Each transcript file contains JSON objects with session events

## Relevance to Local Recall

This is important for the MCP server's background daemon which syncs transcripts from Claude's cache to process them for memory extraction.
