Transcripts are condensed into a structured format before being sent to Claude for memory extraction. This preprocessing step reduces token usage and improves the quality of extracted memories by removing noise and organizing the transcript into clear [User], [Assistant], [Tool], and [Result] events. This is a more efficient approach than processing raw transcripts.
