Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools (via MCP) to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files stored locally within the repository. The system has three main components: Core memory management (CRUD operations and vector-based search), Claude Code hooks (session-start, user-prompt-submit, stop), and an MCP server for exposing memory tools to compatible clients.
