The memory extraction process in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API (specifically claude-haiku) to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. The system uses a dedicated prompt file (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) that guides the model on what constitutes a good memory. The extraction process is asynchronous and processes transcripts to identify:

- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

The extracted memories follow the standard memory format with YAML frontmatter including id, subject, keywords, applies_to scope, occurred_at timestamp, and content_hash for deduplication.
