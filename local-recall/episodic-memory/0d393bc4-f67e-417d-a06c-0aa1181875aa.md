## Potential Issues

1. **Path Resolution**: Hooks may not be resolving the memory directory path correctly
2. **File Permissions**: Memory files may exist but hooks lack read permissions
3. **Silent Failures**: Hooks may be catching errors without logging them
4. **Working Directory**: Hook execution context may have different working directory than expected

## Solutions to Test

- Verify LOCAL_RECALL_DIR environment variable is set correctly
- Check file permissions on memory files
- Add detailed logging in hook code to track execution
- Use absolute paths instead of relative paths when possible
- Test file access in isolation
