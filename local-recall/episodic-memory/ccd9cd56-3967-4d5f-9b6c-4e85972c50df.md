Local Recall is a local markdown-powered memory system that enables Claude Code and other AI tools (via MCP) to retain information and context across sessions. The system stores structured memory files locally within the repository, making them version-controllable and shareable. The architecture includes core memory management, Claude Code hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit), and an MCP server for memory tools. Memory files use YAML frontmatter with metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash).
