Search result scoring from Orama vector store:
- Score range: 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (identical match)
- Uses cosine distance similarity
- Scores rounded to 2 decimal places (e.g., 0.65)
- Results sorted by score descending
- **Recency tie-breaker**: When scores are equal, more recent memories (higher `occurred_at`) are ranked first

This ensures that functionally similar memories are presented in chronological order when similarity is equivalent.
