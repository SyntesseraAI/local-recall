# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by underscores. For example:
- Project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` has transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcript files are stored as `<session-id>.json` in the transcripts directory.

This information is crucial for the transcript-collector and MCP daemon to locate and process transcripts across different projects and machines.
