# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full transcript path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line) with `.jsonl` extension.

## Important for MCP Server

When implementing transcript collection in the MCP server (daemon), use this path format to locate and process project transcripts. The path needs to be constructed dynamically based on the working directory passed via stdin.
