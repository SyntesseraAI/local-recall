# Claude Model Selection for Transcript Processing

When extracting information from transcripts or parsing transcript content, use Claude Haiku instead of larger models.

## Rationale

- **Cost**: Haiku is significantly cheaper than Sonnet or Opus
- **Performance**: Haiku is fast enough for parsing and extraction tasks
- **Efficiency**: For routine transcript analysis, the performance difference is negligible

## Application

The MCP server daemon currently uses `claude -p` (Haiku) to extract memories from transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes. This pattern should be maintained or extended for similar transcript-based operations.
