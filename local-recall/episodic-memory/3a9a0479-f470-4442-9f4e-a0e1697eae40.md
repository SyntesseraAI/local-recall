The local-recall project uses `npm run build` which runs `tsc && npm run build:scripts`. The TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) must pass without errors before the build scripts execute. This is a sequential pipeline where TypeScript compilation is the first gate - any type errors will prevent the build scripts from running.
