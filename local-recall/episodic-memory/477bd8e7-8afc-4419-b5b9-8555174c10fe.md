When extracting memories from transcripts, focus on:
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks
- User preferences
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

DO NOT extract temporary debugging steps, generic programming knowledge, or information that becomes outdated quickly.
