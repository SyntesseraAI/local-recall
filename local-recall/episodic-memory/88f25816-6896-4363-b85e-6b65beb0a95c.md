ThinkingExtractor class exists (lines 103-310) with capability to extract thinking blocks from transcripts in parallel (20 workers as noted in architecture docs). The implementation was complete but the daemon never called it. The extractor handles extracting thought+output pairs from transcripts and storing them as thinking memories, separate from episodic memory extraction.
