The vector store (src/core/vector-store.ts) uses better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension for semantic search. Embeddings are generated using fastembed with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB). Search results use cosine distance similarity (0.0-1.0 range, rounded to 2 decimal places), sorted by score descending with recency tie-breaker using occurred_at timestamps.
