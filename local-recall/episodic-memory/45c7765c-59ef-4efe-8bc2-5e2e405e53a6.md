The MCP server includes a background daemon that automatically processes transcripts asynchronously. The daemon: syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`), processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories, tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection, deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change, and runs every 5 minutes. This allows memories to be extracted without blocking user interactions. The Stop hook is currently disabled in favor of this asynchronous daemon approach.
