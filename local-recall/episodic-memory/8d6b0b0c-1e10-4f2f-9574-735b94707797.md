Claude Code does not have a formal 'Rules system'. Instead, behavior is controlled through:

1. **Skills** - Autonomously triggered based on user intent and conditions
2. **Settings** (.claude/settings.json) - Configuration for hooks, MCP servers, and tool behavior
3. **CLAUDE.md** - Project-specific instructions and conventions
4. **MCP Server Descriptions** - Tool documentation and availability constraints

This distributed approach allows flexibility but requires understanding where each behavior is controlled. Skills can check CLAUDE.md at runtime to adapt behavior to project conventions.
