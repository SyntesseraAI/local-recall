# Claude Project Transcripts Location and Path Format

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Conversion to Folder Names

The project folder name converts the absolute path by replacing forward slashes with dashes:
- Original path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Claude projects folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`
- Transcripts stored in: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

Each transcript is stored as a JSONL file with session information and turn-by-turn exchanges.

## Key Implementation Detail

When implementing transcript collection or syncing features, remember that the folder name is predictable from the working directory path. This allows the MCP server and hooks to locate transcripts without requiring explicit configuration.

## Relevance to Local Recall

The transcript-collector needs to understand this path format to locate and sync transcripts from Claude's cache during MCP server operations.
