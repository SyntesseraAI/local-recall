# Memory Extraction via MCP Server

The Stop hook is disabled. Memory extraction from transcripts is handled asynchronously by the MCP server daemon.

## Process

1. The MCP server runs a background daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes
2. It syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
3. Uses `claude -p` command-line tool to extract memories from transcript content
4. Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
5. Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change

## Benefits

- Asynchronous processing prevents blocking Claude Code sessions
- Efficient change detection via content hashing
- Memories are extracted without slowing down the user's workflow
