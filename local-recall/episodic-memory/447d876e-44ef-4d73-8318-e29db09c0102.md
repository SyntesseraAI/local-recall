The session-start hook in `src/hooks/session-start.ts` reads JSON input from stdin with session metadata (session_id, transcript_path, cwd) and outputs relevant memories to stdout for context injection. It loads the memory index from `local-recall/index.json` and searches for relevant memories based on current context. The hook requires `npm install` and `npm run build` to be executed first to generate bundled scripts in the `scripts/` directory.
