# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The memory extraction process uses transcript condensing to:
1. Reduce token usage for Claude API calls
2. Focus on semantically important content
3. Preserve intent and decisions while removing verbose explanations

## Condensing Rules

When condensing transcripts for memory extraction:
- Keep user intent and requests
- Keep Claude's key findings and explanations
- Remove repeated clarifications and verbose explanations
- Preserve code snippets and technical details
- Keep tool results that are relevant to the outcome
- Remove tool invocations that didn't lead to important discoveries

Example: Long debugging session → Keep the root cause and solution, remove intermediate investigation steps that led nowhere.
