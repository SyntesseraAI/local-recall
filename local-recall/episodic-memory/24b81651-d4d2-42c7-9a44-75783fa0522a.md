# Claude Transcript Storage Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Folder Naming Convention

Project folders are named by converting the absolute working directory path:
- Replace all forward slashes with dashes
- For working directory `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`, the folder is `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in subdirectories within each project folder, with each line being a complete JSON object representing a transcript event.
