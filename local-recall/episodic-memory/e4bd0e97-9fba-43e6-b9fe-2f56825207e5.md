The memory extraction prompt is stored separately in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts rather than hardcoded. This allows for easy updates and maintains consistency across all memory extraction operations. The prompt should guide Claude Haiku to extract memories following the project's guidelines for specificity, actionability, and appropriate scope.
