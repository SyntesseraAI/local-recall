Local Recall enables persistent memory storage across Claude Code sessions through structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings (BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic search. Memory files are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` and are version-controlled in git. The architecture includes hooks for SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit, plus an MCP server for broader compatibility.
