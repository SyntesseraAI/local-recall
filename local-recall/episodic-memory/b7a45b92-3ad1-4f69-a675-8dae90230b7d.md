Memory files stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` are version-controlled in git. They should capture important architectural decisions, code patterns, bug fixes, and other discoveries that will help future AI assistants. Each memory uses YAML frontmatter with fields: id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, and content_hash. Memories should be atomic (one concept per file) and use specific keywords for searchability.
