# Memory Extraction Uses Claude Haiku for Keywords

When extracting memories from transcripts, the system uses Claude Haiku (`claude -p --model haiku`) to extract relevant keywords from the transcript content.

## Key Details

- The model is specifically Haiku (not Sonnet or Opus) for cost efficiency
- Uses the `-p` flag to specify the model
- Keywords are extracted before memory creation to improve searchability
- This is part of the background memory extraction process in the MCP server

## Related Components

- `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` - Implements memory extraction
- Background daemon runs every 5 minutes to process new transcripts
- Helps ensure extracted memories are semantically relevant
