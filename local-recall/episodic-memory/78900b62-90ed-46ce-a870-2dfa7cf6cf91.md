# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Slashes `/` are replaced with underscores `_`
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`

## File Structure

Inside each project folder:
- `transcripts/` subdirectory contains transcript files
- Files are named with timestamps and have `.jsonl` extension
- Each line in a JSONL file is a complete JSON object representing one event

## Usage in Local Recall

The transcript collector (`src/core/transcript-collector.ts`) uses this path to:
1. Find the correct project transcripts directory
2. Read and parse JSONL transcript files
3. Extract memories from completed sessions

This is essential for the background daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes.
