The project implements a transcript condensing feature that converts detailed session transcripts into condensed event format for memory extraction. This condensed format uses markers like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, and `[Tool: Name]` to represent the key events in a session, making transcripts more suitable for AI analysis and memory extraction.
