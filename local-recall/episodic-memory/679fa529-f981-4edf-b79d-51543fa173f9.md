Fixed memory extractor array format issue. Build verification: npm run build completed successfully with no TS errors. Full test suite (npx vitest run) shows 220 tests passing. Previous test suite run had 1 exit code from npm run test:unit but vitest shows all tests passing, indicating the issue was resolved.
