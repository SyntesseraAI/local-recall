The MCP tool `mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__memory_create` is not available in the current environment. This suggests either the MCP server is not running, the tool is not properly registered, or the naming convention for MCP tools has changed. Future sessions should verify MCP server status and tool registration before attempting to use memory creation tools via MCP.
