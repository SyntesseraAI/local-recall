The vector store implementation in `src/core/vector-store.ts` scores search results using cosine distance similarity:
- Score range: 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (identical)
- Scores are rounded to 2 decimal places
- Results sorted by score descending
- **Recency tie-breaker**: When scores are equal, memories with more recent `occurred_at` timestamps rank first

This ensures that while semantic relevance is primary, more recent memories get priority in tie scenarios.
