The memory extractor in memory-extractor.ts uses the Anthropic SDK to call Claude models for extracting memories from condensed transcripts. It sends specially formatted prompts that include project context and transcript events to Claude, which then returns structured memory data. The extraction process includes:

- Input validation and formatting of transcript events
- Custom prompt injection via memory-extraction.ts
- Claude API calls with structured response parsing
- Error handling for API failures and malformed responses

This is a critical component for the memory extraction pipeline that runs asynchronously to process session transcripts.
