Created MigrationService that handles one-time conversion from markdown files to JSONL format. Reads all existing .md files from episodic-memory/ and thinking-memory/ directories, parses YAML frontmatter, creates 'add' entries in JSONL files, and deletes original markdown files and directories. Tracks migration state with a .migrated flag file to prevent re-running. Called automatically on MCP server startup.
