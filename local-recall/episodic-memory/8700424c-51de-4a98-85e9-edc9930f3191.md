# Local Recall Development Session

The project is actively being worked on with recent changes to memory storage and embedding systems. Key recent commits show:

- **Migration to JSONL format**: Memory storage was migrated from markdown to JSONL (`episodic-jsonl-store.ts`, `thinking-jsonl-store.ts`)
- **Pre-computed embeddings**: Added support for auto-compaction integration
- **Large memory deletions**: ~80 thinking memory files were deleted (clean-up operation)
- **Large memory additions**: ~400+ new episodic and thinking memory files created

The system now supports both episodic and thinking memories with dual vector stores (Orama indices).

## Current Hooks State

Three hooks are modified:
- `session-start.js` - Loads recent memories on session start
- `user-prompt-submit.js` - Unified semantic search for both memory types
- `stop.js` - Currently disabled, memory extraction via MCP daemon

The Stop hook is disabled because memory extraction is handled asynchronously by the MCP server daemon (runs every 5 minutes).
