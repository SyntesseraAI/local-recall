# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes and colons removed:
- `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the project folder:
- Each line is a JSON object representing a transcript event
- Files are named sequentially: `transcript-1.jsonl`, `transcript-2.jsonl`, etc.

## Usage in transcript-collector.ts

The transcript collector uses this path to:
1. Build the projects directory path: `path.join(os.homedir(), '.claude', 'projects')`
2. Convert project paths to folder names using a conversion function
3. Read and process JSONL files from the appropriate project folder
4. Extract memories from the transcript events

This implementation is OS-specific and needs to account for platform differences when building file paths.
