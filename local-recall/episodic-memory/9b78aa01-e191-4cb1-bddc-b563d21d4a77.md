Claude Code stores project data in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project folders use an encoded path naming convention where filesystem path separators are replaced with hyphens. For example, a project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` would have transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`. Transcript files are stored in JSONL format with names like `transcript-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u.jsonl`.
