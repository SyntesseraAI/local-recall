The project centralizes prompt definitions in a `src/prompts/` directory. The memory extraction prompt is stored in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` rather than being hardcoded in the memory-extractor module. This separation of concerns allows for:

- Easy maintenance and updating of prompts
- Reusability across different parts of the codebase
- Clear documentation of instructions given to Claude
- Version control of prompt templates
