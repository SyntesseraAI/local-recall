# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/`
- Transcripts location: `~/.claude/projects/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/transcripts/`

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format) in this directory.

## Relevance

This information is critical for the `transcript-collector.ts` module which needs to locate and read Claude's transcript files to extract memories. The path construction must account for the full absolute path of the project directory.
