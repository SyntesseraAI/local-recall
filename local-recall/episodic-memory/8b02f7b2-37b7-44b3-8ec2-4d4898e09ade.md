# Keyword Extraction in Memory Extraction Process

When extracting memories from transcripts, the process involves:

1. **User Request Pattern**: Users may ask to extract keywords from text
2. **Expected Response**: Return ONLY a JSON array of keyword strings, no explanation
3. **Integration**: These keywords become part of the memory's searchable metadata

## Important Notes

- Keywords should be lowercase and specific
- Array format: `["keyword1", "keyword2", ...]`
- No additional text or explanation should be included
- This is a sub-step within the larger memory extraction process
