The memory extractor uses the Claude API (via claude command) with streaming output to process transcripts and extract memories. It passes the transcript content and extraction prompt to Claude, which returns structured memory data. The implementation handles both successful extractions and edge cases where Claude cannot extract memories from certain transcripts.
