The ensureGitignore() function only created gitignore if it didn't exist, meaning existing files weren't updated with new patterns. Since the gitignore is auto-generated, it should always be written to ensure new patterns (like memory.sqlite) are properly ignored. This ensures consistency across new user setups.
