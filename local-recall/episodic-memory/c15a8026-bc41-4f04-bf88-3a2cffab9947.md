The SessionStart hook in `src/hooks/session-start.ts` loads memories directly from disk (no vector store) and returns the 5 most recent sorted by `occurred_at`. This avoids slow vector database initialization on every session start. The vector store is only initialized on UserPromptSubmit for semantic search.
