# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/`
- Transcripts: stored in `transcripts/` subdirectory as `.jsonl` files

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) format with one transcript object per line. Each object contains event data from Claude Code sessions.

## Relevance to Local Recall

The MCP server daemon processes these transcripts asynchronously (every 5 minutes) to extract memories. The transcript path is available to hooks via the `transcript_path` field in hook input JSON.
