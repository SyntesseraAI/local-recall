The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model with streaming enabled to process transcripts and extract memories. The extractor reads condensed transcripts, sends them to Claude with a system prompt for memory extraction, and processes the streamed response to build memory objects. This allows for efficient processing of large transcripts without loading the entire response into memory at once.
