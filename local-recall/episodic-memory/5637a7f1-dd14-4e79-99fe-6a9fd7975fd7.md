Memory extraction happens asynchronously via an MCP server background daemon that:
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/)
- Processes transcripts using Claude API to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
- Runs every 5 minutes

This allows the system to work without blocking user interactions while keeping memories fresh.
