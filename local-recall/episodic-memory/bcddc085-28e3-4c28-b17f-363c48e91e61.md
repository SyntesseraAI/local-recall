Each memory is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing:
- `id`: UUID for unique identification
- `subject`: Brief one-line description
- `keywords`: Array of searchable keywords
- `applies_to`: Scope (global, file:<path>, or area:<name>)
- `occurred_at`: ISO-8601 timestamp of when the event occurred
- `content_hash`: SHA-256 hash prefix (16 chars) for deduplication

Memory files are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` and are version-controlled in git.
