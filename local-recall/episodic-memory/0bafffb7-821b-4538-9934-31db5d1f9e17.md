# Memory Extraction Work in Progress

The user is actively working on understanding and potentially improving the memory extraction and lifecycle management in local-recall.

## Context
- Currently refactoring memory collection based on Claude's requirements
- Focus on how transcripts are processed and converted to memories
- Interested in the complete memory lifecycle: creation, storage, search, and retrieval
- Working with transcript condensing for better memory extraction
