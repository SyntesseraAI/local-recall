# Transcript Condensing Requirements

When condensing transcripts for memory extraction:

## What to Preserve
- User requests and intentions ([User])
- Assistant responses and explanations ([Assistant])
- Tool invocations with names ([Tool: Name])
- Tool results and outcomes ([Result: OK/ERROR])
- Important context about what was accomplished

## Formatting Standards
- Use consistent prefix format: `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, `[Result: Status]`
- Normalize whitespace and line breaks
- Remove redundant tool output details
- Preserve code snippets that are relevant
- Keep error messages and debugging info when useful

## What to Omit
- Verbose tool output that isn't directly relevant
- Repetitive explanations
- Implementation details of tools themselves
- Debugging output unless it reveals important patterns

## Purpose
Condensed transcripts are the input for memory extraction - they should be readable and focused enough for an AI to understand what was accomplished and extract valuable learnings.
