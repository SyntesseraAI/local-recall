The memory extraction system uses transcript condensing as an intermediate step before sending transcripts to Claude for memory extraction. This reduces token usage and improves efficiency by:

1. Condensing the full transcript into key events and decisions
2. Filtering out verbose explanations and redundant information
3. Preserving only the essential context needed for memory extraction
4. Using Claude Haiku for the extraction process (cost-effective)

This approach significantly reduces the number of tokens processed while maintaining the quality of extracted memories.
