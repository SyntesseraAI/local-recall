The SessionStart hook deliberately avoids initializing the vector store for performance reasons:

- Uses MemoryManager.listMemories() instead of vector search
- Returns 5 most recent memories sorted by occurred_at
- Loads from disk on every session start (not incremental)
- Avoids slow initialization overhead that would delay session startup

This is a performance trade-off: recency-based loading is faster than semantic search, which is more appropriate for session initialization.
