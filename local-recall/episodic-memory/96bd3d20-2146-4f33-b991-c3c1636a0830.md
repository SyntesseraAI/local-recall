Specialized prompt templates for memory extraction are centralized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This separation of concerns keeps the extraction prompts organized and maintainable.

The prompts likely define:
- How to analyze transcripts
- What constitutes valuable memories
- Required fields and structure for extracted memories
- Guidelines for scope, keywords, and content

Centralizing prompts makes it easier to refine extraction quality and keep the system consistent as guidelines evolve.
