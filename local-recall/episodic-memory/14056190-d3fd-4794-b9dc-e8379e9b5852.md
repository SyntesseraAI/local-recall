The Local Recall project underwent a refactoring where the memories directory was renamed from `memories/` to `episodic-memory/`. This naming change was part of commit 48ecf07 (refactor: rename memories directory to episodic-memory across the project).

All code and configuration should reference `episodic-memory/` for memory file storage, not `memories/`. The CLAUDE.md documentation shows the correct structure with `episodic-memory/` directory.
