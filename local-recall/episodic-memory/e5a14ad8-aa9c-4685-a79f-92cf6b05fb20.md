# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`
- Transcripts location: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

Each transcript is stored as a `.jsonl` file (JSON Lines format) with a timestamp-based filename like `20250101-120000-abc123.jsonl`.

## Important Details

- Transcripts are stored in the user's home directory, not in the project directory
- The path transformation converts `/` to `-` and removes the leading `/`
- Each line in a `.jsonl` file is a separate JSON object representing a turn in the conversation
- The transcript collector needs to construct this path dynamically based on the working directory
