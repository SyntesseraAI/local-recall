Memory scope determines where a memory applies:
- **global**: Applies to the entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- **file:<path>**: Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- **area:<name>**: Related to a component/area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

When extracting memories, carefully consider scope to help future assistants understand context and applicability. This enables more targeted memory retrieval and prevents irrelevant memories from cluttering search results.
