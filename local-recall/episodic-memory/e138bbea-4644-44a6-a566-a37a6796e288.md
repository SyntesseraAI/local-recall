# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Structure

The project folder name uses the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files, with one JSON object per line representing a conversation event.

## Use Case

This is useful for the transcript-collector component which needs to:
- Locate and read transcript files for memory extraction
- Process transcripts asynchronously in the MCP server daemon
- Track processed transcripts using content hashes for change detection
