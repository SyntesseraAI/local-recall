Updated memory schema in types.ts: Removed `updated_at` field (memories are immutable). Kept `occurred_at` (when the event/conversation happened) as the sole timestamp for temporal ordering. This single timestamp is part of the deduplication key. Memory files sort by `occurred_at` descending to show most recent events first, supporting chronological memory retrieval.
