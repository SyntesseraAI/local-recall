# Stop Hook Status

The Stop hook that was mentioned in `hooks.json` is currently disabled.

## Why Disabled

Transcript processing and memory extraction have been moved from the Stop hook to the MCP server background daemon for better reliability and async processing.

## How Memory Extraction Works Now

1. The MCP server background daemon runs every 5 minutes
2. It syncs transcripts from Claude's cache location
3. Uses `claude -p` to extract memories from transcripts
4. Creates memory files using the memory manager
5. Tracks processed transcripts to avoid duplicate processing

## Hook Configuration

The Stop hook configuration is still present in `hooks.json` but is not actively used. This is a legacy configuration that should be removed in a future cleanup.
