The memory extraction pipeline includes a transcript condensing step that consolidates transcript events into a more compact format before sending to Claude Haiku for memory extraction. This reduces token usage and processing time by removing redundant information while preserving the essential context needed for memory extraction. This is particularly important given the volume of transcripts processed by the MCP server daemon.
