# Memory Extraction Process

Extracting meaningful memories from transcripts requires multiple steps:

## Transcript Condensing

Raw transcripts are verbose. Before extracting memories, the transcript should be condensed into a structured format:
- Remove noise and repetitive information
- Focus on significant actions and decisions
- Combine related events into coherent actions
- Format as structured events:
  - `[User]` - User requests or questions
  - `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
  - `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations with names
  - `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool calls

## Analysis

After condensing, use Claude Haiku to:
1. Extract keywords for searchability
2. Determine scope (global, file-specific, area-specific)
3. Identify what was learned
4. Create actionable, concise memory content

## Importance

Proper condensing ensures:
- Memories are concise and focused
- Keywords are relevant and specific
- Scope is correctly identified
- Future assistants can understand the context quickly
