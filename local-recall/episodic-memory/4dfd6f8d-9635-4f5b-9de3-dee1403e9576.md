Memory extraction analyzes Claude Code session transcripts that are condensed into event types:
- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude responses or explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool operations

The memory extraction system processes these events to identify valuable learnings that benefit future AI assistants.
