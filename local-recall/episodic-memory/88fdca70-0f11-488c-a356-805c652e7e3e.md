# Memory Extraction Workflow

The memory extraction process uses the `claude -p` command with Claude Haiku to extract keywords from user prompts and transcript content.

## Process

1. **Keyword Extraction**: Uses `claude -p --model haiku` to intelligently extract keywords from text
2. **Source**: Currently applied to user prompts in the UserPromptSubmit hook
3. **Purpose**: Keywords are used for fuzzy searching the memory index

This differs from hard-coded keyword extraction and allows for more intelligent, context-aware memory retrieval.
