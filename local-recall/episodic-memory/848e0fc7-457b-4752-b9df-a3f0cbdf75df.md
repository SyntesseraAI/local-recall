Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI assistants. It stores memories as structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter in local-recall/episodic-memory/. The MCP server runs a background daemon that processes transcripts every 5 minutes, extracting memories using Claude (claude -p) to identify valuable insights from sessions. Memory files are version-controlled and include metadata like id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, and content_hash for deduplication.
