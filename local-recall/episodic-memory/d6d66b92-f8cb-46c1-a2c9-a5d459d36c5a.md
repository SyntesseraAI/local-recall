The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku to process transcripts and extract memories. It leverages a structured prompt system defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides the AI model to generate:

1. **Keywords**: Searchable terms derived from the transcript content
2. **Memory objects**: Structured memories with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content

The extraction process is designed to be consistent and deterministic by providing clear prompts and structured output formats that guide Claude's responses.
