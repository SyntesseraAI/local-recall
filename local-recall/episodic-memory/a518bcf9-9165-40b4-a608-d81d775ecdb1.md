# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by underscores. For example:
- Project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` is stored at `~/.claude/projects/_Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/`
- Within that directory, transcripts are in the `transcripts/` subdirectory

## Transcript File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) files where each line is a JSON object representing a transcript event:
- Each line contains a complete JSON object (not separated by commas)
- Files are named with session IDs or timestamps
- The MCP server's transcript collector reads and parses these files

## Usage in Local Recall

The `transcript-collector.ts` reads from this location to extract memories from Claude Code sessions. The path is derived from the project's absolute path by replacing `/` with `_`.
