When extracting memories from transcripts:
- Include specific file paths, function names, and concrete details
- Focus on architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and user preferences
- Use appropriate scope: `global` for codebase-wide patterns, `file:<path>` for file-specific details, `area:<name>` for component-related knowledge
- Avoid generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, or information that becomes outdated quickly
- Each memory should be atomic and actionable for future assistants
