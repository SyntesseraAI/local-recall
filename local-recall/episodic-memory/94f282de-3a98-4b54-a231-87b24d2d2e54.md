When Claude returns a response that cannot be parsed as JSON, the memory extractor has error handling to deal with malformed responses. This is important because Claude may occasionally return incomplete JSON or invalid syntax, so the extractor needs robust parsing with appropriate error messages and recovery mechanisms rather than failing silently.
