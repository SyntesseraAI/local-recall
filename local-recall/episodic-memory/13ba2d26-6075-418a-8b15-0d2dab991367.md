# SessionStart Hook

## Functionality

When a Claude Code session begins:
1. Loads `local-recall/index.json` (the keyword index)
2. Optionally retrieves relevant memories based on current context
3. Outputs memory content to stdout (injected into Claude's context)

## Purpose

Ensures Claude has access to important project-specific knowledge and context from the first moment of the session, improving code understanding and decision-making.
