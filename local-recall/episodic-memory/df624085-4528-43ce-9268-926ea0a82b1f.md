# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with leading slash removed and remaining slashes replaced with underscores.

### Example
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`
- Transcripts location: `~/.claude/projects/Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files where each line is a JSON object representing a message or event in the conversation.

## Important for transcript-collector.ts

The transcript collector needs to construct this path dynamically using `process.cwd()` and the path transformation logic described above to find and read transcripts.
