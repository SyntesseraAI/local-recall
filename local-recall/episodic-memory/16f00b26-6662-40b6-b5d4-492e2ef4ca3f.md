## Memory Directory Structure
Memory files are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory:
- Each memory is a separate markdown file with YAML frontmatter
- Files are named using the memory ID (e.g., `{uuid}.md`)
- This directory is version-controlled in git
- The `local-recall/` directory also contains `index.json` (gitignored) and `recall.log` (gitignored)

## Key Points
- Memory files ARE tracked in git and should be committed
- The index is auto-generated and should NOT be committed
- The log file is for debugging and should NOT be committed
- Memory files use YAML frontmatter with metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash)

## Configuration
The memory directory path can be configured via:
- Environment variable: `LOCAL_RECALL_DIR`
- Default location: `./local-recall`
- In hooks and MCP server, use environment variable to locate the memory directory
