# UserPromptSubmit Hook Enhanced Logging

## Improvements
1. **Initialization timing**: Added logging for total hook execution time
2. **Search operation timing**: Separate timing for episodic and thinking memory searches
3. **Better error messages**: Include operation context (which memory type, when it failed)
4. **Graceful failure handling**: Catches and logs errors without crashing
5. **Configuration visibility**: Logs the actual configuration being used at startup

## Purpose
Allows debugging of hook performance issues and identifying bottlenecks in memory search operations.
