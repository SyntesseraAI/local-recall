The local-recall memory system extracts memories from Claude Code session transcripts. It analyzes:
- What was learned
- What is now known about the codebase
- Codebase-specific patterns and conventions
- Problems solved and how

Memories should be specific, concise, actionable, and scoped appropriately (global, file-specific, or area-specific).
