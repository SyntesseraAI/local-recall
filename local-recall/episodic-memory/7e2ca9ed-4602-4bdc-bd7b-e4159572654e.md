Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project folders are named based on the full path to the project, with slashes replaced by dashes (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall` for `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`). Individual transcript files are stored as JSONL format with names like `transcript_<session_id>.jsonl`. The MCP server daemon syncs these transcripts to the local-recall memory system for processing.
