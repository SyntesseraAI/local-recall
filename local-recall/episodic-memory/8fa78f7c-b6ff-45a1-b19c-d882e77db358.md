Based on recent refactoring (commit 8c4fbf5), transcripts are condensed before being sent to the memory extraction process. This preprocessing step:

- Reduces token usage by summarizing transcript content
- Maintains important information while removing noise
- Is performed before the memory extractor processes the transcript
- Helps ensure memory extraction focuses on valuable insights rather than raw transcript data

This is part of the asynchronous memory extraction pipeline that runs separately from the main Claude Code session.
