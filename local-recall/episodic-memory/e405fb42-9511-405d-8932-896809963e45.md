Memory scope using `applies_to` field:
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`)

Choose scope carefully to ensure memories are retrieved in appropriate contexts.
