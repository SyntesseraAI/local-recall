Local Recall is a local markdown-powered memory system that enables Claude Code and other AI tools (via MCP) to retain information and context across sessions. All memories are stored locally within the repository as markdown files with YAML frontmatter, making them version-controllable and shareable. The system uses SQLite with vector embeddings (fastembed BGE-small-en-v1.5 model) for semantic search.
