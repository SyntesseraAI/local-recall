The memory extraction prompt is structured to guide Claude through systematic analysis of transcripts. The prompt:

- Asks Claude to analyze what was learned, what is now known, and what problems were solved
- Specifies memory format with YAML frontmatter (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash)
- Provides guidelines for what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, configurations) and what to avoid (generic knowledge, temporary steps, sensitive data)
- Instructs Claude to scope memories appropriately (global, file:path, area:name)
- Returns JSON with memories array
- Emphasizes being specific, concise, and actionable in memory content
