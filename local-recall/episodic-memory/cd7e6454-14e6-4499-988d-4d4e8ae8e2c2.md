# Memory Extraction Process

The local-recall system analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to extract valuable memories that help future AI assistants working on the codebase.

## Key Guidelines

- **Be specific**: Include file paths, function names, and concrete details
- **Be concise**: Focus on one concept per memory
- **Be actionable**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently
- **Scope appropriately**:
  - `global` - Entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
  - `file:<path>` - Specific file details
  - `area:<name>` - Component or area-specific knowledge

## What to Extract

DO extract:
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions
- Configuration quirks
- User preferences
- Component relationships
- Performance considerations

DO NOT extract:
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Output Format

Memories are returned as JSON with:
- `subject`: Brief one-line description (max 200 chars)
- `keywords`: Array of 1-10 searchable keywords (lowercase, specific)
- `applies_to`: Scope string
- `content`: Detailed markdown content
