# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with forward slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line) in the `transcripts/` subdirectory:
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`
- File format: `.jsonl` extension
- Content: Each line is a JSON object representing a transcript event

## Use Case

This information is critical for the MCP server's background daemon, which syncs transcripts from Claude's cache to extract memories using `claude -p` for processing.
