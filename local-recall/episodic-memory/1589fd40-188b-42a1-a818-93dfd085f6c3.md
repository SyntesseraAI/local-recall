The memory extraction system in memory-extractor.ts uses Claude's API with streaming to process transcripts efficiently. It extracts memories by analyzing condensed session transcripts and returns structured memory objects. The system handles streaming responses and processes them into formatted memories that can be stored in the memory system.
