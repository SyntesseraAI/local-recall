The SessionStart hook returns only the 5 most recent memories (sorted by `occurred_at`) without using the vector store. This is a performance optimization to avoid slow vector store initialization on every session start. Full semantic search is deferred to the UserPromptSubmit hook which initializes the vector store lazily.
