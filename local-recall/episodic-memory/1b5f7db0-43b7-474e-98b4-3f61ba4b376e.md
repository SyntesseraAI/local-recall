Local Recall uses the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) from fastembed for semantic search. On first run, the model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` and cached for subsequent runs, adding 30-60 seconds to initial startup. If the cache is corrupted (incomplete download), remove the directory (`rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*`) and the model will re-download automatically.
