The local-recall directory IS the plugin root. Compiled JavaScript is bundled to `scripts/hooks/` and `scripts/mcp-server/` during build. TypeScript source is in `src/` directory. Environment variable `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is used in hooks.json to reference bundled scripts relative to plugin installation.
