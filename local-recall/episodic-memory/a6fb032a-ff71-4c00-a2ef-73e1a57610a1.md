Memories are deduplicated using two fields: `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp of when the event occurred) and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix of the content). This allows the system to detect and avoid storing duplicate memories even when extracted at different times. The `findDuplicate` function in memory.ts checks both fields.
