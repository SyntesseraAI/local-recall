The MCP server includes a background daemon that runs every 5 minutes to sync transcripts from Claude's cache, process them to extract memories, and track processed transcripts using content hashes for change detection. This replaces the Stop hook which is now disabled. The daemon creates and recreates memories when transcripts change.
