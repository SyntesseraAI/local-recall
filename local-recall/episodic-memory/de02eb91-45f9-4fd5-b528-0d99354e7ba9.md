Transcript condensing is used to reduce the token count of transcripts before passing them to Claude Haiku for memory extraction. This is important because:

1. Raw transcripts can be very large and expensive to process
2. Condensing preserves key information while removing noise (repeated confirmations, verbose explanations)
3. The condensed format maintains the event structure needed for memory extraction

The condensed format uses:
- `[User]` - User requests
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses  
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Tool outcomes

This enables efficient processing while retaining the context needed to extract meaningful memories about what was learned, discovered, or solved.
