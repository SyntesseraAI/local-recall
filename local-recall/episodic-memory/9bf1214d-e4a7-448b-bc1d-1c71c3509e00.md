The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Anthropic Claude API to process transcripts. It implements streaming responses using the Messages API with `stream: true`. The system extracts structured memories from session transcripts to help future AI assistants understand context and decisions. Key components include:

- Uses `@anthropic-ai/sdk` for API interactions
- Implements streaming for efficient processing of large transcripts
- Processes condensed transcript format with events like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, and `[Tool: Name]`
- Extracts memories with structured metadata (subject, keywords, applies_to, content)
