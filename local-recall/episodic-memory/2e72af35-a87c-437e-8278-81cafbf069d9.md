The memory extraction system uses `claude -p --model haiku` to process transcripts and extract memories. This is done via shell command execution in the MCP server daemon. The system reads transcripts, passes them through the extraction prompt, and parses the JSON response to create memory records. This approach keeps extraction lightweight while maintaining quality.
