The Local Recall system processes Claude Code session transcripts to extract memories automatically. Transcripts from the Claude cache are collected, condensed, and processed through the memory extractor which uses Claude API to identify and format valuable memories. These memories are then stored as markdown files in the episodic-memory directory for future reference.
