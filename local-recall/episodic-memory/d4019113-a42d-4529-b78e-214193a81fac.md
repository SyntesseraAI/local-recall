# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## Transcript Storage

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory:
- Path: `~/.claude/projects/<project-folder>/transcripts/`
- File format: `.jsonl` (JSON Lines - one JSON object per line)
- Each line contains a transcript event with structure like: `{"type": "user", "content": "..."}`

This path convention is important for the `transcript-collector` module which syncs and processes Claude's transcripts for memory extraction.
