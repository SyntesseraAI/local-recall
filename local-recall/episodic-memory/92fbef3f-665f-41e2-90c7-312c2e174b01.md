Claude Code instances use stdio transport for MCP communication and each instance spawns its own independent MCP server process. This means:

- Different projects have separate MCP servers
- Same project opened in multiple Claude Code windows may have multiple MCP servers writing to the same recall.log
- Each server instance independently runs transcript collection and vector syncing

This can lead to duplicate log entries if multiple servers are active for the same project directory.
