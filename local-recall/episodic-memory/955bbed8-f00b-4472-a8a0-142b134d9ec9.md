Claude Code hooks are configured in `hooks.json` and execute as shell commands. They receive JSON input via stdin containing:
- `session_id`: Current session identifier
- `transcript_path`: Path to session transcript
- `cwd`: Current working directory
- `prompt`: (UserPromptSubmit only) The user's submitted prompt

Hooks output memory content to stdout which gets injected into Claude's context automatically. This allows hooks to augment Claude's knowledge with relevant memories before processing.
