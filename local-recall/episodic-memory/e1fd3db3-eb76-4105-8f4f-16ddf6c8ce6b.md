The local-recall project relies on Claude APIs returning structured JSON output for memory extraction. This requires:
- Proper validation of JSON responses before creating memories
- Error handling for malformed or partial JSON from the API
- Token counting to ensure responses stay within limits
- Careful prompt engineering to ensure consistent JSON formatting

This structured approach enables programmatic memory creation and deduplication.
