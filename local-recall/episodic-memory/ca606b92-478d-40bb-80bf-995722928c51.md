Memory extraction prompts are stored in a dedicated prompts module (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) rather than hardcoded in the extraction logic. This separation of concerns makes it easier to iterate on prompt engineering and maintain consistent prompting across the system. The prompts define clear guidelines for what memories to extract and how to format them.
