The memory extraction prompt system provides Claude with specific guidance on:

1. **What to extract**: Architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences
2. **What NOT to extract**: Generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, trivial information, sensitive data
3. **Scoping rules**:
   - `global` - Architecture, conventions, preferences applying to entire codebase
   - `file:<path>` - Specific to particular files
   - `area:<name>` - Related to components or functional areas
4. **Keywords**: Should be specific, actionable, 1-10 per memory, lowercase
5. **Content**: Detailed markdown format with context and rationale

The prompt emphasizes being specific with file paths and function names, making memories actionable for future assistants, and avoiding outdated or sensitive information.
