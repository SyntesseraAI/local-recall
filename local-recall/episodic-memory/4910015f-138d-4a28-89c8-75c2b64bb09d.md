The memory extraction process uses Claude Haiku (lightweight model) to:

- Extract keywords from transcript events (user messages, assistant responses)
- Process transcript content through `claude -p --model haiku` command
- Parse the returned keywords for search indexing
- This approach is more effective than simple regex/heuristic keyword extraction
