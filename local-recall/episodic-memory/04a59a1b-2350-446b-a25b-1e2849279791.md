Memory markdown files in local-recall/episodic-memory/ are committed to git for team sharing. The SQLite database (local-recall/memory.sqlite), embedding model cache (local_cache/), and debug log (recall.log) are gitignored. Auto-generated .gitignore in local-recall/ excludes these. Memories are idempotent and shared, but indexes are locally generated.
