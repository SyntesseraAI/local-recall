The memory extraction process in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. The extraction uses a structured prompt from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides Claude to identify:

- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences
- Component relationships
- Performance considerations

The prompt explicitly excludes generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and sensitive data. This ensures extracted memories are specific, actionable, and long-term valuable for future AI assistants working on the codebase.
