# Claude Code Session Transcript Structure

Claude Code transcripts (`.jsonl` files) contain an array of events, where each line is a complete JSON object.

## Event Structure

Each event has:
- `type`: The event type (e.g., "message", "tool_call", "tool_result")
- `role`: Who performed the action (e.g., "user", "assistant")
- `content`: The actual content/data of the event
- `timestamp`: When the event occurred

## Common Event Types

- **message**: User or assistant messages
- **tool_call**: When Claude invokes a tool
- **tool_result**: The result/output from a tool
- **tool_use**: Tool usage within a message

## Parsing Strategy

When reading transcripts for memory extraction:
1. Parse each line as a separate JSON object (JSONL format)
2. Filter events by type to extract relevant information
3. Combine context from multiple events to form complete interactions

## Relevance

The transcript-collector and memory-extractor modules need to understand this structure to properly extract memories from session transcripts.
