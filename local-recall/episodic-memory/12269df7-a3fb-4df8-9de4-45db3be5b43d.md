When extracting keywords or content from markdown, be careful to handle both inline code (backtick-wrapped text) and code blocks (triple-backtick fenced blocks). Include code content in keyword extraction as it often contains important identifiers and patterns relevant to memory context. Don't strip code sections as they provide valuable semantic information.
