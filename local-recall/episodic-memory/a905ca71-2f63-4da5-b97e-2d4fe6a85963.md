The memory extraction prompt in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts defines instructions for Claude to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. The prompt:

- Instructs Claude to extract memories from specific categories (what was learned, what is known, what is specific to codebase, what problems were solved)
- Defines guidelines for memory extraction (be specific, be concise, be actionable)
- Specifies memory scope rules (global, file:<path>, area:<name>)
- Lists what to extract (architectural decisions, bug fixes, patterns, quirks, preferences)
- Lists what NOT to extract (generic knowledge, temp debugging, obvious info, sensitive data, outdated info)
- Returns memories as a JSON array with subject, keywords, applies_to, and content fields

This prompt is used by the MemoryExtractor to guide memory creation during transcript processing.
