# Memory Extraction from Session Transcripts

## Process Overview

The memory extraction workflow analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to identify and store valuable information that helps future AI assistants.

## Key Guidelines

### What to Extract
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations and optimizations

### What NOT to Extract
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Scope Guidelines

- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`)

## Memory Format Requirements

Each memory must have:
- `subject`: Brief one-line description (max 200 chars)
- `keywords`: Array of 1-10 searchable keywords (lowercase, specific)
- `applies_to`: Scope string
- `content`: Detailed markdown-formatted content

Memories should be:
- **Specific**: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- **Concise**: Focus on one concept per memory
- **Actionable**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work efficiently
