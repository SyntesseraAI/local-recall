The memory extraction prompts are stored separately from the extraction logic in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This separation of concerns allows for easy maintenance and iteration of the extraction instructions without modifying the extraction logic itself. The prompts define how Claude should identify what memories to extract from transcripts.
