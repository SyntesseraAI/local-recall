Vector search results use the following scoring and ranking:

- **Score range**: 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (perfect match)
- **Calculation**: `Math.round((1 - distance / 2) * 100) / 100` (rounded to 2 decimal places)
- **Primary sort**: By similarity score (descending)
- **Secondary sort (tie-breaker)**: When scores are equal, sort by `occurred_at` descending (newest first)

This ensures cleaner score display (e.g., 0.65 instead of 0.65234) and guarantees most recent memories appear first when relevance is equivalent.
