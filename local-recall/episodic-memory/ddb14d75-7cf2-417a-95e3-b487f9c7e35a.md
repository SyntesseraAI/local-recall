Investigation found that while messages can have multiple thinking blocks logged in transcripts, across 69,308 examined transcript entries, all 14 cases with multiple thinking blocks were duplicates (identical content) caused by streaming artifacts, not true interleaved thinking. The pattern thinking→tool_use→thinking that appears in transcripts is actually separate messages with different message IDs. No true within-message interleaved thinking was found.
