# User Preferences for AI Assistant Communication

## No Emojis in Technical Output

The user has configured Claude Code to avoid using emojis in technical output. This is reflected in the default system settings and should be respected when communicating about code, architecture, and technical tasks.

## Task Communication

When managing complex tasks, use explicit task lists and status tracking (via TodoWrite tool) rather than informal communication. This helps maintain clarity and allows the user to track progress systematically.

## Implications for Claude Code Hooks

When Claude Code hooks output memory content or diagnostic information, it should avoid emojis to maintain consistency with the user's communication preferences.
