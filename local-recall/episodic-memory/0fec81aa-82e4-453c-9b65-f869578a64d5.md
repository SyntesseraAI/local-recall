# Transcript Condensing for Memory Extraction

The background daemon in the MCP server uses transcript condensing to improve memory extraction efficiency.

## Implementation Details

- Located in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`
- Transcripts are condensed into a summarized event format before being sent to Claude for memory extraction
- This reduces token usage and improves processing speed compared to sending raw transcripts
- The condensing process preserves important information while removing redundancy

## Benefits

- Reduces API costs by lowering token count
- Faster processing of transcripts in the background daemon
- Still maintains enough context for Claude to extract meaningful memories
