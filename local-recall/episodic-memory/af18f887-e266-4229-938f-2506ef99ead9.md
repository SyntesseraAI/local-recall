The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku to process transcripts and extract valuable memories. The extraction prompt is defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and follows a structured format to ensure consistent, high-quality memory extraction from session transcripts.
