# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path:
- Slashes (/) are replaced with dashes (-)
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## Transcript File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the format `transcripts/<timestamp>.jsonl`

Each line contains a JSON object representing a transcript event with fields like:
- `type`: Event type (e.g., "user", "assistant", "tool")
- `timestamp`: When the event occurred
- `content`: The actual message or tool output

## Relevance to Local Recall

The `transcript-collector.ts` module reads from this location to sync transcripts for memory extraction. Understanding this path convention is critical for:
- Correctly locating transcripts for a given project
- Building the transcript sync daemon
- Testing transcript processing locally
