# Local Recall Background Daemon

The MCP server runs a background daemon that:
1. Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts.jsonl`)
2. Processes transcripts using Claude Haiku to extract memories
3. Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
4. Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
5. Runs every 5 minutes

The Stop hook is currently disabled - memory extraction is handled entirely by the background daemon, not by the Stop hook event.

This design allows for:
- Asynchronous processing without blocking Claude Code
- Proper deduplication of memories across multiple sessions
- Automatic cleanup when transcripts are updated
