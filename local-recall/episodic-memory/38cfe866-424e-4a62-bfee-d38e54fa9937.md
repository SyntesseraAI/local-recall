Local Recall's embedding pipeline:
- Uses `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic embeddings
- Model size: ~133MB
- Auto-downloads on first use, cached in `local_cache/` directory
- First startup takes 30-60 seconds (one-time cost)
- Subsequent runs load instantly from cache

**Troubleshooting**: If getting "Tokenizer file not found" error, the cache is corrupted. Solution: `rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and re-run to download fresh copy.
