# Hook Input Context

Claude Code hooks receive JSON input via stdin containing:
- `session_id`: Unique identifier for the current session
- `transcript_path`: Path to the session transcript file
- `cwd`: Current working directory where Claude is operating

For UserPromptSubmit hook, an additional field is included:
- `prompt`: The user's submitted prompt text

This context allows hooks to:
1. Read the current transcript for memory extraction
2. Search memories based on the project context (via `cwd`)
3. Understand what the user is working on

The Local Recall system uses these inputs to search and inject relevant memories into the session context.
