The extraction prompt is specifically designed to help Claude identify and extract memories that are actionable and project-specific. It emphasizes extracting knowledge about code patterns, architectural decisions, configuration details, and bug fixes with their root causes. The prompt explicitly excludes generic programming knowledge and temporary debugging steps, focusing only on information that will help future AI assistants.
