Initial proposal to add HTTP server to MCP server won't work for multiple Claude instances because each instance would try to use the same port, creating conflicts. The original daemon concern applies: multiple MCP servers would each try to load ONNX, causing the same mutex problem. The solution must be truly external and shared (like Ollama), not embedded in per-instance services.
