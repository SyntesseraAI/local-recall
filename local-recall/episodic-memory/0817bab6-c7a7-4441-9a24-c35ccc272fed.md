The migration from SQLite/sqlite-vec to Orama (pure JavaScript vector search) successfully resolved the mutex contention errors that previously occurred when hooks tried to load the native sqlite-vec extension. The hook-daemon architecture no longer needs HTTP communication workaround to avoid concurrent sqlite-vec process locks. This is a significant architectural simplification - hooks can now directly use the vector store without the HTTP fallback pattern.
