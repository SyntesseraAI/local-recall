The UserPromptSubmit hook was not wired up in `.claude/settings.json` initially, which meant it was not firing despite the code being correct and built. Once `.claude/settings.json` was created with proper hook configuration pointing to the built scripts in `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/`, the hook became available for use.
