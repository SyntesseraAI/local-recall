Extract specific, actionable memories: architectural decisions, bug fixes with root cause, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, performance optimizations. Use global scope for architecture/conventions, file: for file-specific patterns, area: for components. Avoid generic knowledge, temporary debugging, obvious info, sensitive data, or quick-to-obsolete information.
