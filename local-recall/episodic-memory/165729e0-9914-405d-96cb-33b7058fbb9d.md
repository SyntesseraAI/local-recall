# Code Change Philosophy

The user prefers minimal, focused code changes and explicitly discourages over-engineering:

## Key Preferences

1. **Don't refactor surrounding code** - If fixing a bug, don't clean up unrelated code
2. **Don't add features beyond what's requested** - Keep features simple and focused
3. **Don't add docstrings/comments unnecessarily** - Only document non-obvious logic
4. **Don't add error handling for impossible scenarios** - Trust internal guarantees
5. **Avoid premature abstractions** - Three similar lines of code is better than a helper utility
6. **Keep it simple** - Use the minimum complexity needed

## When Making Changes

- Focus on the specific task requested
- Keep solutions straightforward
- Delete unused code completely (don't rename with underscores)
- Make only necessary changes
- Trust that framework and internal code work as expected
