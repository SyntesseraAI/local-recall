The Stop hook is disabled. Memory extraction is handled by an MCP server daemon that runs asynchronously every 5 minutes. The daemon processes transcripts from Claude's cache (~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/), detects changes using content hashes, deletes old memories when transcripts change, and recreates them. This allows transcript processing to happen in the background without blocking Claude Code sessions.
