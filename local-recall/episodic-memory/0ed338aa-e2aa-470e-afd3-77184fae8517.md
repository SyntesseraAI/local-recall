The prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` provides clear guidance to Claude Haiku on how to extract valuable memories from transcripts:

DO extract:
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Component relationships
- Performance considerations

DO NOT extract:
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Quickly outdated information

Memories use scope appropriately: `global` for codebase-wide, `file:<path>` for specific files, `area:<name>` for components.
