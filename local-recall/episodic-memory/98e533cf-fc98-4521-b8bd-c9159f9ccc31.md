The memory extraction prompt is designed to output memories in a specific JSON format that allows for line-by-line parsing during streaming. Each memory is output as a separate JSON object (not in an array), which enables the extractor to parse and process memories as they arrive rather than waiting for a complete array structure.

This design choice is important for streaming efficiency - the prompt generates newline-delimited JSON that can be parsed incrementally.
