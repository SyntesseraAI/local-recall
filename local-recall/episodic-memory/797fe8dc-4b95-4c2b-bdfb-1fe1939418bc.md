# Local Recall Embedding Model Configuration

Local Recall uses the `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search.

## Model Details

- **Model Name**: BGE-small-en-v1.5
- **Model Size**: ~133MB
- **Purpose**: Semantic search for memory retrieval
- **Library**: fastembed (Python library)

## Cache Location

- **Default Cache**: `local_cache/` directory in the project root
- **Full Path Example**: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`
- **Contents**: Tokenizer files, model weights, and other model artifacts

## Important Behavior

- Model is automatically downloaded on first use (30-60 seconds)
- Subsequent runs load from `local_cache/` (very fast)
- Cache can become corrupted if download is interrupted
- Corrupted cache can be fixed by removing `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and letting it re-download

## Integration Points

- Used by the MCP server for semantic search of memories
- Essential for memory_search tool functionality
- Downloaded automatically - no manual setup required
