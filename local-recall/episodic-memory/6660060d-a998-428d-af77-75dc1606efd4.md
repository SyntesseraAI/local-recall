# Keyword Extraction Using Claude Haiku

The user-prompt-submit hook extracts keywords from user prompts using the Claude Haiku API.

## Implementation Details

- Uses `claude -p --model haiku` command (Claude Haiku via CLI)
- Sends the user's prompt to the API with a structured extraction request
- Returns a JSON array of keywords for fuzzy searching memories

## Why Haiku?

Haiku is fast and cost-effective, making it suitable for real-time keyword extraction during user interactions. This allows the system to search relevant memories before Claude processes the prompt.

## Integration Point

The extracted keywords are used by the search module to find matching memories with fuzzy matching, which are then injected into Claude's context before prompt processing.
