# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by underscores.

### Example
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`
- Transcript files: `~/.claude/projects/Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (JSON Lines) where each line is a complete JSON object representing one message/event in the conversation.

## Transcript Collector Implementation

The `transcript-collector.ts` module handles reading these transcripts from the Claude cache directory.

## Important Notes

- This is specific to macOS (path structure may differ on Windows/Linux)
- The folder structure is based on the full path with underscores
- Used by `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` to populate the MCP server's background daemon
- Understanding this path structure is critical for the memory extraction pipeline
