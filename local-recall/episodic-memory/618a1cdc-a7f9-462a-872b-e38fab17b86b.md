The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku model to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. The extraction process uses a structured prompt defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides Claude to identify and format memories according to the project's standards. This approach ensures consistent, high-quality memory extraction across sessions.
