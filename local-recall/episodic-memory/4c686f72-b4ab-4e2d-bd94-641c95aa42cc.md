Local Recall is a project that creates a persistent memory layer for AI assistants like Claude Code. It enables multiple AI agents to store and retrieve contextual information about the codebase, share knowledge across sessions, and maintain project-specific memories. All memories are stored locally within the repository as markdown files with YAML frontmatter, making them version-controllable and shareable among team members.
