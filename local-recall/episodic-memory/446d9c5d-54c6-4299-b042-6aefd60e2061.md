Each memory file is stored as markdown with YAML frontmatter containing: id (UUID), subject, keywords array, applies_to (global|file:<path>|area:<name>), occurred_at (ISO-8601 timestamp), and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix of content for deduplication). Memory files are committed to git (episodic-memory/ directory) while index.json and recall.log are gitignored. The findDuplicate() function uses occurred_at + content_hash to prevent storing identical memories.
