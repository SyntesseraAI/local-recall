The memory system is designed to be idempotent. When creating memories, the system checks for duplicates using both `occurred_at` timestamp and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix). If a memory with the same timestamp and content hash already exists, the creation returns the existing memory instead of creating a duplicate. This prevents the accumulation of duplicate memories from repeated transcript processing.
