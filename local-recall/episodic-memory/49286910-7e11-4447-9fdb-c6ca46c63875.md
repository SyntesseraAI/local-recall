Local Recall uses fastembed library with the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. The model is:

- Automatically downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use
- Cached locally for subsequent runs (avoiding repeated downloads)
- Initial startup may take 30-60 seconds for model download
- Subsequent runs load from cache

If tokenizer file is missing, remove the corrupted cache directory and it will re-download automatically on next run.
