The extraction prompt guides Claude to identify:
1. What was learned - new knowledge and insights
2. What is now known - important facts about codebase/architecture
3. What is specific to the codebase - unique patterns and configurations
4. What problems were solved - bugs fixed and solutions applied

Memories should be specific (include file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes). Inappropriate extractions to avoid: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, and sensitive data.
