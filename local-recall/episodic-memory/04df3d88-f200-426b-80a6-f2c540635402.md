# Claude Project Transcripts Location and Naming

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) format files with `.jsonl` extension, where each line is a separate JSON object representing a transcript event.

## Importance

This location is critical for the transcript collector to locate and process transcripts from Claude Code sessions. The naming convention must be understood to correctly map working directories to their corresponding transcript files.
