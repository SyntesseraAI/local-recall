The memory extraction prompt emphasizes extracting memories that are:
- **Specific**: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- **Actionable**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently
- **Appropriate scope**: Use `global` for codebase-wide patterns, `file:<path>` for specific files, `area:<name>` for components

DO NOT extract generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, or obvious information. Focus on architectural decisions, bug fixes with root causes, code patterns unique to this project, and configuration quirks.
