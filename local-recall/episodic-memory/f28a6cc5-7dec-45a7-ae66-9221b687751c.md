The memory extractor in memory-extractor.ts uses Claude's streaming API to process transcripts. It accepts a `condensedContent` parameter that contains the transcript in a condensed format (Events like [User], [Assistant], [Tool], [Result]) rather than raw transcript text. The extractor sends this to Claude with a memory extraction prompt to identify valuable memories.
