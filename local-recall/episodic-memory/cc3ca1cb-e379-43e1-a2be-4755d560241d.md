## User Preference: Explicit Error Details

The user prefers detailed, explicit error information rather than vague success claims:

- **Don't claim 'everything works'** if you haven't verified it
- **Show actual error messages** rather than summarizing
- **Be specific about what was tested** and what wasn't
- **If something might be wrong**, acknowledge it rather than glossing over it
- **Provide concrete evidence** of success (command output, logs, test results)

This preference helps ensure transparency and makes it easier to identify and fix actual issues.
