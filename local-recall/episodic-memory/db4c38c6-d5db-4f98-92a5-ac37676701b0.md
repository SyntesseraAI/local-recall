The `.gitignore` file in the `local-recall/` directory should be tracked in git and contain:
- `/index.json` - Auto-generated keyword index, should not be version-controlled
- `/recall.log` - Debug log file, should not be version-controlled
- `!/episodic-memory/` - Explicitly allow tracking of memory files in the episodic-memory subdirectory

This file should be created by MemoryManager during initialization to ensure it exists before any memory operations.
