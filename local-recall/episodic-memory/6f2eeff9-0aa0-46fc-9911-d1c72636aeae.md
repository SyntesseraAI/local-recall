Thinking memories have a distinct structure from episodic memories, storing reasoning patterns along with their outputs. The system provides `formatThinkingMemoryForDisplay()` utility to format them consistently for context injection.

### Key Understanding
- Thinking memories pair Claude's internal reasoning (the `thought` field) with the corresponding text output
- They are stored as markdown files with the same YAML frontmatter metadata as episodic memories
- The formatter creates readable sections with clear separation between the thinking and output
- Thinking memories help future sessions by providing examples of "how I reasoned → what I produced"

### File References
- Storage: `src/core/thinking-memory.ts` contains the ThinkingMemoryManager
- Formatting: `src/utils/markdown.ts` contains `formatThinkingMemoryForDisplay()`
