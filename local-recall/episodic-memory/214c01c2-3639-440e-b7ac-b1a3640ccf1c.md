The memory extraction prompt provides clear guidelines for what should and shouldn't be extracted. It emphasizes extracting: architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, and performance considerations. It explicitly excludes: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious information, sensitive data, and outdated information. The prompt also defines scope rules (global, file:, area:) to help classify memories appropriately.
