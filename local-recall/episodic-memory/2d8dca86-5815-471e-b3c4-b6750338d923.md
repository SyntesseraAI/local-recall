# Memory Extraction Uses Claude Haiku

The memory extraction pipeline uses Claude Haiku (`claude -p --model haiku`) for fast keyword extraction from transcripts.

## Implementation Details

- `memory-extractor.ts` processes transcript content through Claude Haiku
- Haiku extracts relevant keywords and creates memories from transcript events
- This is more efficient than running larger models for keyword extraction
- The MCP daemon calls the memory extractor on processed transcripts

## Why Haiku

Haiku is chosen because:
- Fast response time for keyword extraction
- Lower cost for frequent extraction operations
- Sufficient quality for identifying relevant keywords from technical transcripts
- Reduces latency in the async memory processing pipeline
