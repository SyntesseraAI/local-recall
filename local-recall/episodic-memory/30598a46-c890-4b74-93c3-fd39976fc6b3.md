# MCP Memory Tools Refactor

Removed `memory_update` and `memory_delete` tool definitions from MCP server.

## Changes

- Removed the entire tool definition for memory_update
- Removed the entire tool definition for memory_delete
- Kept only: `memory_create`, `memory_get`, `memory_list`, `memory_search`

Memories are now append-only. Users must manually delete files from the filesystem if they need to remove memories. This enforces the immutable episodic log design.
