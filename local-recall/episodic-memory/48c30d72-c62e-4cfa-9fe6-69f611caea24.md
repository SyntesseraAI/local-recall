The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku model with streaming enabled for processing transcripts. This design choice optimizes for token efficiency while maintaining quality memory extraction. The extractor processes transcripts to identify and extract valuable memories that help future AI assistants.

Key implementation details:
- Uses `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` model
- Streaming is enabled (`stream: true`)
- Takes transcript content and extraction prompt as inputs
- Processes output to build memory objects
