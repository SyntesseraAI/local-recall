The memory manager deduplicates memories using a combination of:
1. `occurred_at` timestamp - when the original event occurred
2. `content_hash` - SHA-256 prefix (16 characters) of the memory content

The `findDuplicate()` function checks both fields to identify if a memory already exists before creating a new one. This prevents duplicate memories from being created when the same concept is re-discovered in different sessions.
