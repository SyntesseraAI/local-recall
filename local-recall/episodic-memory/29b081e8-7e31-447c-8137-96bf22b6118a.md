Created `src/core/transcript-condenser.ts` to parse Claude Code transcript JSONL format and extract only essential content blocks. The condenser:

- Parses JSONL files where each line is a JSON object representing a transcript event
- Filters events to only include User messages and Tool results (Assistant messages are typically verbose explanations)
- Reduces token usage significantly compared to full transcript processing
- Designed for use in the stop hook memory extraction pipeline

This is critical for keeping memory extraction efficient and focused on actionable information rather than verbose AI explanations.
