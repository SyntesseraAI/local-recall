# Memory Extraction Process

The Local Recall system uses transcript analysis to extract valuable memories from Claude Code sessions. The extraction process focuses on:

1. **What was learned** - New knowledge and insights
2. **What is now known** - Important facts about the codebase
3. **What is specific to this codebase** - Unique patterns and quirks
4. **What problems were solved** - Bug fixes and their root causes

## Guidelines

Memories should be:
- **Specific**: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- **Concise**: Focus on one concept per memory
- **Actionable**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work efficiently
- **Properly scoped**: Use `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>` appropriately

## What to Extract vs Avoid

**Extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences and important component relationships

**Avoid:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Quickly outdated information
