The daemon-based architecture (http-server.ts, daemon-client.ts, database.ts) was removed. Hooks (session-start.ts, user-prompt-submit.ts) now work directly without needing to communicate with a background daemon via HTTP. This simplifies the codebase and eliminates inter-process communication complexity.
