# Transcript Condensing Strategy

When extracting memories from Claude Code transcripts, the raw transcript can be verbose with repetitive tool invocations and outputs. Condensing the transcript first helps:

1. **Reduces noise**: Removes verbose tool outputs that aren't essential for memory extraction
2. **Focuses on intent**: Concentrates on what was learned rather than implementation details
3. **Improves clarity**: Makes it easier for the memory extraction process to identify key insights
4. **Maintains context**: Preserves essential information about tools used and their outcomes

A condensed format should capture:
- User requests and goals
- Key assistant explanations
- Tool invocations and their results (summarized)
- Conclusions and decisions made

This is useful for the stop hook when processing transcripts asynchronously.
