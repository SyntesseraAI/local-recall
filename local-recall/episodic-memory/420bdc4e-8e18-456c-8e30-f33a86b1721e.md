The project is undergoing a storage migration from individual markdown files to JSONL format. The expected final state is:

- JSONL files should be stored IN the episodic-memory/ and thinking-memory/ folders (not in local-recall/ root)
- Example: `local-recall/episodic-memory/episodic-000001.jsonl` instead of `local-recall/episodic-000001.jsonl`
- All *.md files should be deleted after migration
- The JSONL files should contain embedding vectors alongside the memory data (not stored separately in Orama index)

Current state has JSONL files in root directory with minimal entries, and markdown files still exist across 779 episodic and 2132 thinking memory files.
