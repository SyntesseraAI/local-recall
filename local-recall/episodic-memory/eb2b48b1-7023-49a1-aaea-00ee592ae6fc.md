The `local_cache/` directory contains cached embedding model files (from Ollama) and should never be committed to git. This directory needs to be added to `.gitignore`. In the recent commit history, local_cache files were accidentally added to git, requiring history rewriting to remove them. Always ensure `local_cache/` is in .gitignore before committing.
