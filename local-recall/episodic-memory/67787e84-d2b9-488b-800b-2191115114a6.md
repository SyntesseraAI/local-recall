1. **CLI** - Add `init`, `search`, `list`, `create` commands for CLI users
2. **Deduplication** - Improve duplicate detection and merge similar memories
3. **Memory decay/pruning** - Implement automatic archival of stale memories
4. **Smarter retrieval** - Context-aware loading based on currently open files
5. **Enhanced stop hook** - Improve automatic memory extraction from transcripts
6. **Live testing** - Install plugin in real projects and validate functionality
