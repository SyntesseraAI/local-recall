The memory-extractor module uses the Anthropic Claude API to analyze session transcripts and extract structured memories. It sends transcripts to Claude Haiku model with a detailed prompt (from memory-extraction.ts) that instructs the model to identify key learnings, discoveries, and actionable insights. The extracted memories are then validated and stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the episodic-memory directory.
