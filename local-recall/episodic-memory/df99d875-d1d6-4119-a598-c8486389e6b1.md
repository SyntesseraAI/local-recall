Three hooks integrate Local Recall with Claude Code:

1. **SessionStart**: Triggered on session begin, loads 5 most recent memories (no vector store, just recency)
2. **UserPromptSubmit**: Triggered before Claude processes prompt, performs semantic search using vector embeddings
3. **Stop**: Currently disabled - memory extraction handled asynchronously by MCP server daemon

Hooks are configured in `hooks.json` and receive/send JSON via stdin/stdout.
