The memory-extractor.ts module uses Claude Haiku (via `claude -p --model haiku`) to extract structured memories from session transcripts. It sends transcripts through a dedicated extraction prompt (from src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts) that instructs Claude to identify valuable memories and return them as JSON objects with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content fields. This is the core mechanism for converting raw transcripts into persistent, reusable memories.
