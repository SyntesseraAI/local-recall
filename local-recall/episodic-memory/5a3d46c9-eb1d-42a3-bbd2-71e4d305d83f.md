Memory scope must be carefully chosen based on applicability:

- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file (e.g., `file:src/utils/config.ts`)
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`, `area:database`)

Choosing appropriate scope helps future assistants find relevant memories quickly and understand their applicability.
