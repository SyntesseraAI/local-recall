When extracting memories from transcripts, prioritize:
- Specific details (file paths, function names, concrete examples)
- Actionable information that helps future assistants
- Codebase-specific patterns and conventions
- Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Architectural decisions and reasoning

Avoid generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, or information that becomes outdated quickly.
