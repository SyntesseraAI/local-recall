The MCP server runs a background daemon that processes Claude transcripts every 5 minutes. It syncs from `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-project>`, detects changes using content hashes, deletes old memories when transcripts change, and recreates them with new extracted memories. The Stop hook is disabled - memory extraction happens entirely through this daemon mechanism.
