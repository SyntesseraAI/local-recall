The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API with streaming enabled to handle large transcripts efficiently. The `extractMemoriesFromTranscript` function accepts a transcript string and calls Claude's API with `stream: true` to process the response incrementally, reducing memory overhead for large transcript processing.
