The vector store (src/core/vector-store.ts) uses:
- `better-sqlite3` with `sqlite-vec` extension for vector similarity search
- `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for embedding generation
- Model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use (30-60 seconds)
- Search results use cosine distance similarity scored 0.0-1.0, rounded to 2 decimal places
- Results sorted by score descending, with recency tie-breaker using `occurred_at`
- Database file (`memory.sqlite`) is gitignored and auto-generated
