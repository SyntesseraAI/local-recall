# Path Resolution in Transcript Collector

When collecting transcripts, the system needs to understand the relationship between:
1. The project's working directory (`cwd` from hook input)
2. The Local Recall installation directory (where the plugin is installed)
3. File paths in memories (which should be relative to the project, not the plugin)

## Key Consideration

Memories should store file paths relative to the user's project (`cwd`), not relative to the Local Recall plugin installation. This ensures memories remain valid when the plugin is updated or the project is moved.

When processing transcripts, ensure that any file references extracted are normalized to the project root directory.
