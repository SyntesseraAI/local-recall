The codebase uses TypeScript with strict compiler settings. Key configuration:

- Located in `tsconfig.json`
- Enforces strict type checking across all modules
- Compiles to ES2020 target with module output
- Uses path aliases for cleaner imports

This strict setup ensures type safety throughout the memory extraction and storage systems, reducing runtime errors.
