The memory extraction prompt that instructs Claude Haiku on how to generate memories from transcripts is stored in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This is a dedicated prompt file separate from the core memory extraction logic in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts`. When updating memory extraction behavior, check both files to understand the full system.
