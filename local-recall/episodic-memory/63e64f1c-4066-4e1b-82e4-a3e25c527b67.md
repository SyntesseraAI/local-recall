Local Recall uses the fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search capabilities. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use. First startup may take 30-60 seconds while the model downloads, but subsequent runs load from cache. If the tokenizer file is corrupted, delete `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` and it will re-download automatically.
