# Transcript Processing for Memory Creation

## Content Deduplication

Memories use content hashing to detect duplicates:
- Field: `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix, 16 chars)
- Used in: `findDuplicate(occurredAt, contentHash)` method
- Purpose: Prevent duplicate memories when processing same transcript multiple times

## Timestamp Handling

- Field: `occurred_at` (ISO-8601 format)
- Represents: When the original event occurred (not when memory was created)
- Used for: Deduplication logic and sorting results
- Critical for: Tracking which memories relate to which session events

## Processing Considerations

- Transcripts from different sessions may contain overlapping information
- The combination of `occurred_at` and `content_hash` uniquely identifies a memory
- Memory extraction must parse transcript content intelligently to identify extractable concepts
- The MCP server processes transcripts asynchronously (every 5 minutes) to batch operations
