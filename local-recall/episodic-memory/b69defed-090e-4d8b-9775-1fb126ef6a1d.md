Local Recall uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` on first use. First run may take 30-60 seconds while downloading. If tokenizer file not found error occurs, remove corrupted cache and model will re-download automatically.
