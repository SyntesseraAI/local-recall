Key decision points for next phase: Build CLI (init, search, list, create commands), implement memory deduplication and merge logic, add memory decay/pruning for stale memories, improve context-aware retrieval based on current files, enhance stop hook analysis, or live test in a real project. All are potentially valuable next steps.
