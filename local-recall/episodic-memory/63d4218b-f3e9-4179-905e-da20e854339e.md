The MemoryManager class was not creating the .gitignore file in the local-recall directory. While IndexManager had ensureGitignore() logic, MemoryManager only created the memories subdirectory without ensuring the root .gitignore exists. This caused memory files to be untracked in git. The fix involved adding ensureGitignore() call in the MemoryManager constructor to create .gitignore with appropriate entries during initialization.
