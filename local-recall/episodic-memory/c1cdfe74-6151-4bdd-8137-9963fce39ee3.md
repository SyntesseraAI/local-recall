# MCP Server Background Daemon

The MCP server implements an asynchronous daemon that:

1. **Syncs transcripts** - Retrieves transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`
2. **Processes transcripts** - Uses Claude Haiku with `claude -p` to extract memories
3. **Tracks changes** - Uses content hashes to detect when transcripts have changed
4. **Manages lifecycle** - Deletes and recreates memories when transcript content changes
5. **Runs periodically** - Executes every 5 minutes

This asynchronous approach means the Stop hook is currently disabled, and memory extraction happens in the background rather than at session end. This allows for more efficient processing and prevents blocking the Claude Code session.
