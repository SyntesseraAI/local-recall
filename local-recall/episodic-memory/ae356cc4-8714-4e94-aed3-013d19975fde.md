# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Encoding

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path:
- Original path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Encoded name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- All forward slashes are replaced with hyphens

## Transcript Storage

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files within the project folder:
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`
- Format: JSONL (one JSON object per line)
- Each line contains a transcript event with role, content, and timestamp

## Relevance to Memory Extraction

This path information is essential for the transcript-collector component, which needs to locate and process Claude's session transcripts to extract memories.
