The plugin architecture has bundled copies of hook files that can become stale when the main codebase changes. When updating hooks or switching libraries (like from better-sqlite3 to Orama), the plugin's bundled versions must be updated and rebuilt. Key files to keep in sync:

- `src/hooks/*.ts` → `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/*.js`
- Hook configurations in both locations
- Dependencies and environment assumptions

Consider adding a build step or symlinks to reduce duplication.
