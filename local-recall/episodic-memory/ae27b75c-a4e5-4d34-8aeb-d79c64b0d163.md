The memory extraction system includes a condensing step before processing transcripts into memories. Key aspects:

1. **Transcript Condensing**: Long transcripts are condensed to focus on essential information before keyword extraction
2. **Deduplication**: Uses `occurred_at` timestamp and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix) to prevent duplicate memories
3. **Idempotent Creation**: If a memory with the same content_hash and occurred_at already exists, the creation returns the existing memory ID instead of creating a duplicate
4. **Scope Management**: Memories are tagged with `applies_to` scope (global, file:/path, or area:name) to indicate their relevance

This ensures the memory system stays clean and doesn't accumulate duplicate entries from repeated transcript processing.
