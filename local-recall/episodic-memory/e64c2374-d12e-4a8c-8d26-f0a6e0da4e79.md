When extracting memories from session transcripts:
- DO extract: architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configuration quirks, user preferences, component relationships, performance optimizations
- DO NOT extract: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, obvious/trivial information, sensitive data, outdated information
- Be specific with file paths and function names
- Focus on actionable memories that help future assistants
