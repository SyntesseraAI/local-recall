Local Recall uses the fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic embeddings. The model (~133MB) auto-downloads to local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/ on first run, taking 30-60 seconds. Subsequent runs load from cache. If the cache is corrupted, deleting local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5* will force a re-download on next run.
