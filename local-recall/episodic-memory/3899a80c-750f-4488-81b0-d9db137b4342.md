Memory scope is defined by the applies_to field with three options: (1) 'global' - applies to entire codebase, (2) 'file:<path>' - specific to a file like 'file:src/utils/config.ts', (3) 'area:<name>' - related to a component or area like 'area:authentication'. This allows memories to be targeted appropriately when searching or filtering.
