Memory extraction analyzes Claude Code session transcripts that are condensed into events using specific markers:

- `[User]` - What the user asked or requested
- `[Assistant]` - What Claude said or explained
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This format makes it easier to identify what was learned, what is now known, what is specific to the codebase, and what problems were solved during a session.
