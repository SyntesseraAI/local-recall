# User Communication Preferences

The user values **concise, efficient communication** and prefers that the assistant:
- Avoid verbose explanations and filler text
- Get to the point quickly
- Focus on actionable tasks rather than lengthy context
- Skip unnecessary elaboration on well-known concepts

This preference should guide all interactions with this user and help maintain productivity.
