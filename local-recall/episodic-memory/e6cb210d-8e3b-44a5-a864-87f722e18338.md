The memory-extractor.ts module takes condensed transcripts and transforms them into structured memory files. It parses the condensed content to extract relevant information and create memory objects with proper metadata (subject, keywords, applies_to scope, occurred_at timestamp). This module is critical for converting transcript data into the memory format used throughout the local-recall system.
