The SessionStart hook in `src/hooks/session-start.ts` is optimized for fast startup:
- Loads all memories from disk via `MemoryManager.listMemories()`
- Returns the 5 most recent memories sorted by `occurred_at`
- Does NOT initialize the vector store to avoid slow initialization on every session start
- Outputs memory content to stdout (injected into Claude's context)

This is a full reload, not incremental, but fast enough for session startup.
