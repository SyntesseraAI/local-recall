When extracting memories from Claude Code transcripts, use condensed format with event markers ([User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], [Result: OK/ERROR]) rather than full transcripts to manage token usage. This reduces context size while preserving essential information for memory creation. The condensing process should capture key decisions, code changes, and learnings without verbose explanations.
