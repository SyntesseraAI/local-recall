Claude stores project transcript files in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project directories are encoded with the full path where slashes become dashes (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall` for `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`). Each project folder contains a `transcripts/` subdirectory with JSONL files where each line is a complete JSON object representing a transcript event. The MCP server processes these transcripts to extract memories using the transcript-collector component.
