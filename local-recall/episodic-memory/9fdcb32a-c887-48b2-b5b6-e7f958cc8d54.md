Claude stores project transcript files in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Project directories are encoded with the full path where slashes become dashes (e.g., `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall` for `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`). Each session has a `transcripts/` subdirectory containing JSONL files with message exchanges. This is important for the MCP server's background daemon that needs to sync and process transcripts.
