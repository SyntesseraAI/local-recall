The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude API (via claude-sdk) to analyze session transcripts and generate structured memory objects. The `extractMemories` function calls Claude with a system prompt and transcript content, then parses the JSON response containing an array of memory objects with subject, keywords, applies_to, and content fields.
