Three hooks configured in hooks.json: SessionStart (loads 5 most recent memories on session start), UserPromptSubmit (performs semantic search before Claude processes prompt), and Stop (disabled - replaced by MCP daemon). Hooks execute as shell commands receiving JSON via stdin and outputting memory content to stdout for context injection.
