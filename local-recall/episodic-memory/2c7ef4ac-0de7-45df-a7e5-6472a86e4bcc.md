# User Preferences for Code Modification

Based on CLAUDE.md project instructions, the user strongly prefers:

## Avoid Over-Engineering

- Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary
- Keep solutions simple and focused
- Don't add features beyond what was asked
- Don't refactor surrounding code in bug fixes
- Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to unchanged code
- Only add comments where logic isn't self-evident

## Avoid Unnecessary Complexity

- Don't add error handling for scenarios that can't happen
- Don't use feature flags or backwards-compatibility shims
- Don't create helpers/utilities/abstractions for one-time operations
- Don't design for hypothetical future requirements
- Three similar lines of code is better than premature abstraction

## Avoid Backwards-Compatibility Hacks

- Don't rename unused `_vars` or re-export types
- Delete unused code completely rather than adding `// removed` comments

This is a critical user preference that should guide all development decisions.
