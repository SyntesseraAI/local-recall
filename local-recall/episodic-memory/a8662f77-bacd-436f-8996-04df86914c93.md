The memory extraction prompt is stored in a dedicated module (`src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`) separate from the extraction logic (`src/core/memory-extractor.ts`). This separation allows:

1. Easy maintenance and updates to the extraction guidance without modifying the core logic
2. Clear distinction between the prompt content and how it's used
3. Potential reuse of the prompt across different extraction contexts
4. Better readability and organization of the codebase

This pattern suggests the project values clean separation between data/prompts and their execution logic.
