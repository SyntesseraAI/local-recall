# Transcript Condensing Implementation

The transcript-collector.ts file contains functionality to condense transcripts for efficient memory extraction.

## Key Points

- Uses Claude Haiku model for condensing via `claude -p --model haiku`
- Takes full transcript content and produces condensed version
- Condensed transcripts are suitable for memory extraction
- Located in src/core/transcript-collector.ts

## Usage Pattern

The condensing appears to be part of a larger transcript processing pipeline, likely used before memory extraction to reduce token usage and focus on valuable information.

## Related to Session Start

Integrating memory extraction from these condensed transcripts in the session-start hook would complete the memory creation cycle.
