Per CLAUDE.md instructions, all new features must include:
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Documentation in `docs/` folder
- Updated existing docs when modifying functionality
- Tests covering both happy paths and edge cases

Memory files themselves ARE version-controlled and will be committed to git, unlike the gitignored SQLite database.
