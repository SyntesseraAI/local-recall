# User Code Style Preferences

## Quote Usage

The user prefers consistent quote usage throughout the codebase. Recent refactoring (commit 5d8310f) standardized string quotes across the project for consistency.

## Logging Conventions

Improved logging consistency is important to the user. This includes standardizing log message formatting and ensuring debug output is helpful and clear. Logging is a key debugging tool in this codebase, particularly in hooks and the transcript-collector.
