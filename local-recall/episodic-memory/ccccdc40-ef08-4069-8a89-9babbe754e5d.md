# Memory Extraction Process

The local-recall system uses a systematic approach to extract memories from Claude Code session transcripts:

## Extraction Criteria

Extract memories when:
1. New knowledge or insights are gained about the codebase
2. Architectural decisions are made or documented
3. Bug fixes reveal important root causes
4. Code patterns or project-specific conventions are discovered
5. Configuration quirks or gotchas are identified
6. Important component relationships are established
7. Performance considerations are applied

## What NOT to Extract

- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

## Output Format

Memories are structured with:
- `subject`: One-line description (≤200 chars)
- `keywords`: 1-10 searchable keywords
- `applies_to`: Scope (global, file:<path>, or area:<name>)
- `content`: Detailed markdown content

This structured format enables efficient search and retrieval in future sessions.
