The UserPromptSubmit hook logs detailed input information including session_id, transcript_path, cwd, and permission_mode. This helps with debugging issues in memory extraction. The logs are written to recall.log and are valuable for understanding the context in which memory extraction is being attempted. This logging was helpful for diagnosing the memory extraction validation failures.
