The memory extraction system consists of two interdependent files:

1. **src/core/memory-extractor.ts** - The implementation that:
   - Handles transcript processing
   - Communicates with Claude Haiku
   - Manages deduplication and storage
   - Integrates with the memory system

2. **src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts** - The prompt file that:
   - Guides Claude's extraction logic
   - Defines what to extract and what to avoid
   - Provides output format requirements
   - Explains context and guidelines

When working on memory extraction features, changes to extraction logic require updates to both files for consistency.
