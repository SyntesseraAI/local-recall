Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. It enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information across sessions through structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter. The project stores memories locally in the repository, making them version-controllable and shareable.

Key architectural components:
- Memory manager for CRUD operations on memory files
- Vector store (SQLite + embeddings) for semantic search
- Claude Code hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop)
- MCP server for external tool access
- Embedding service using fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model

Memories are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` as markdown files with UUID identifiers. The SQLite database and embedding cache are gitignored.
