The memory extractor module is responsible for taking raw transcripts and converting them into structured memory objects. This appears to be a critical part of the local-recall system that enables the MCP server daemon to asynchronously process transcripts every 5 minutes. The module interfaces with Claude Haiku to intelligently analyze transcript content and identify valuable memories to persist.
