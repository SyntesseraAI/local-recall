Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files stored locally in the repository. The system allows multiple AI agents to store and retrieve contextual information about the codebase, share knowledge across sessions, and maintain project-specific memories that improve over time. All memories are version-controllable and shareable among team members.
