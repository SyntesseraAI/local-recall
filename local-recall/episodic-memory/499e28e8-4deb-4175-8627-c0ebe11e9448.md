# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Naming

Project folders are named based on the absolute working directory with slashes replaced by underscores and leading underscores removed. For example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Folder name: `Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall`
- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/Users_joe_Code_Syntessera_local-recall/`

## Transcript Files

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files in the `transcripts/` subdirectory, with one file per session. Each line is a JSON object representing an event in the session.

This is useful for understanding where Claude stores project history and how to locate transcript files for processing or analysis.
