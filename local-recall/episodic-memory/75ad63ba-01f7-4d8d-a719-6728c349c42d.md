The Stop hook is not triggered by the Claude Code VS Code extension, which prevents the automatic memory creation pipeline from running. The Stop hook is responsible for parsing transcripts and creating memories via `src/hooks/stop.ts:77-108`. This is a limitation of the VS Code extension compared to other Claude Code environments.

Workaround: Use MCP tools directly (`episodic_create`) or enable the MCP server daemon which processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes, regardless of hook support.
