The memory extraction system in memory-extractor.ts uses Claude Haiku (`claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`) with a carefully structured prompt from src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts to analyze transcripts and extract valuable memories. The system passes raw transcript content to Claude which returns JSON-formatted memories with subject, keywords, and applies_to fields. This allows semantic understanding of session context rather than simple keyword matching.
