# Keyword Extraction for Memory Search

The local-recall project uses Claude Haiku to extract keywords from user prompts for memory searching.

## Implementation

- The UserPromptSubmit hook calls Claude Haiku via `claude -p --model haiku`
- Haiku extracts keywords from the user's prompt
- Keywords are used to search the memory index for relevant memories
- Results are injected back into the Claude context

## Purpose

This allows the system to find relevant memories based on the natural language user prompt, rather than requiring exact keyword matches. It improves context retrieval by understanding semantic relevance.
