Three hooks are configured in hooks.json: SessionStart (triggered on session begin, returns 5 most recent memories), UserPromptSubmit (before Claude processes prompt, performs semantic search), and Stop (currently disabled, memory extraction handled by MCP daemon). Hooks use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for relative script paths and receive cwd via stdin to operate on user's project directory. Hook output is injected into Claude's context.
