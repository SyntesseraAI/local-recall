# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts location: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files (JSON Lines format), one event per line:
- Each line is a valid JSON object
- Events include user messages, assistant responses, and tool calls
- Files are not line-delimited JSON but true JSONL format

## Importance

This is critical for:
- The MCP server background daemon that processes transcripts
- Extracting memories from session history
- Deduplicating memories based on transcript content hashes
- Tracking which transcripts have been processed

## Related Code

See `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` for implementation details.
