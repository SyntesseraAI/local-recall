Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. Key architectural components:

- **Memory Storage**: Individual markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` with YAML frontmatter (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash)
- **Vector Store**: SQLite-backed semantic search using fastembed embeddings (BGE-small-en-v1.5 model)
- **Claude Code Integration**: Three hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop) configured in hooks.json
- **MCP Server**: Exposes memory tools (create, get, search, list, rebuild) to Claude and external clients
- **Memory Deduplication**: Uses occurred_at timestamp and SHA-256 content hash prefix to detect duplicates
- **Recency Tie-breaker**: Search results with equal scores are sorted by occurred_at descending

All memory files are version-controlled in git. The SQLite database and embedding cache are gitignored.
