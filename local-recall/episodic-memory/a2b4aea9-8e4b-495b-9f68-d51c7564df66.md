Memory extraction prompts are centralized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` rather than hardcoded in the extractor. This allows for easy modification of extraction behavior and system prompts without changing the core extraction logic. Prompts define the rules for what constitutes a valuable memory and how to format the output.
