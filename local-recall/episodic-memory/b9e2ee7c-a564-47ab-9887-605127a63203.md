The memory extraction process uses well-defined guidelines to determine what is worth extracting:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Trivial or obvious information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly
