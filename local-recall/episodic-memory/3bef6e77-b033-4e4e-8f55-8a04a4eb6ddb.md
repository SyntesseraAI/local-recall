The MCP server is currently running as a background process (PID 4524) from `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/mcp-server/server.js`, not from the main project root. The main project root doesn't have a `scripts/` directory yet - it appears the build output or plugin structure diverges from the core local-recall project.

The MCP configuration is at `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.mcp.json` rather than the project root. This suggests local-recall is being developed as a plugin within a larger marketplace/platform structure.
