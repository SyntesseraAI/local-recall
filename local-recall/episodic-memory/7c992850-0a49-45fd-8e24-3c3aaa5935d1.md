When extracting memories:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- Code patterns specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during sessions
- Important component relationships
- Performance considerations and optimizations

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

**Scope usage:**
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to particular file
- `area:<name>` - Related to component/area (e.g., `area:authentication`)
