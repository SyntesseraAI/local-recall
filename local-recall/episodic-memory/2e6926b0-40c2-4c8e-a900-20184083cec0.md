Local Recall is a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. Architecture includes:

**Core Components:**
- Core memory CRUD operations (memory.ts, index.ts)
- Fuzzy search implementation using Fuse.js (search.ts)
- MCP Server with 6 exposed tools
- Session-start hook that loads relevant memories
- Stop hook that auto-extracts memories from transcripts
- Keyword extraction utilities

**Storage:**
- Memory files stored as markdown with YAML frontmatter
- Version-controlled memories in local-recall/ directory
- Index files auto-generated and gitignored

**Key patterns:**
- Memories are idempotent and deduplicated
- Hooks integrate with Claude Code via stdin/stdout JSON
- Both episodic and thinking memories supported
- Vector embeddings via Ollama (nomic-embed-text, 768 dims)
- Orama for vector store (pure JavaScript)
