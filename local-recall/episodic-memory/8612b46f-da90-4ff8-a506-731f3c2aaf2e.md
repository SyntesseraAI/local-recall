Removed the `ts-textrank` NPM package (^1.0.3) from dependencies as it was replaced with simpler logic. The new implementation:
- Uses basic string operations (split, indexOf)
- No external NLP processing
- Deterministic and testable
- Reduces dependency complexity

This is part of a broader effort to simplify the summarization logic while maintaining the same output quality.
