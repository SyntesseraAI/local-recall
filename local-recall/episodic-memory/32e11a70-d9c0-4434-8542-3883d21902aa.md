The MemoryExtractor class uses the Anthropic Claude API with streaming enabled to extract memories from transcripts. This approach is more token-efficient than non-streaming alternatives. The extraction prompt guides Claude to identify and structure valuable memories from session transcripts, focusing on learnings, discoveries, bugs fixed, and architectural decisions.
