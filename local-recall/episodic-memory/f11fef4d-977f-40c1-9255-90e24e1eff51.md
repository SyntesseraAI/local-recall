# Transcript Collector Implementation Status

The `src/core/transcript-collector.ts` file exists in the codebase but appears to have incomplete or partial implementation based on recent git diffs:

- File shows modifications (M status in git)
- This is a core component for collecting Claude Code transcripts
- Works in conjunction with the MCP server's background daemon
- Responsible for syncing transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/` and extracting memories

Future work may be needed to ensure this component properly handles:
- Transcript parsing and formatting
- Change detection using content hashes
- Memory extraction pipeline
- Integration with the memory creation system
