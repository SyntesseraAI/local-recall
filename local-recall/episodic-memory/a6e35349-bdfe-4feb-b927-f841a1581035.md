Memories are categorized by scope to determine their applicability:
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to a particular file
- `area:<name>` - Related to a component or area (e.g., area:authentication)

Proper scope assignment helps the search system return relevant memories to future assistants working on specific parts of the codebase.
