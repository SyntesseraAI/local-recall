The MemoryManager.findDuplicate() method checks for existing duplicates using occurred_at timestamp and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix). When creating a new memory, if a duplicate is found, the existing memory is returned instead of creating a new one. This prevents accumulation of duplicate memories in the system.
