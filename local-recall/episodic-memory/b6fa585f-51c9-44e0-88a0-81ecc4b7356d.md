The memory extractor module in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` is responsible for:
- Processing transcripts to extract valuable information
- Creating memory files from extracted information
- Handling the flow from raw transcripts to structured memories
- Using dedicated prompts for memory extraction logic

This is a core component that bridges transcript analysis and memory storage.
