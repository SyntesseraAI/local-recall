The local-recall project is undergoing refactoring to enhance memory extraction with semantic search capabilities. Two new core modules are being added:

1. `src/core/embedding.ts` - Handles semantic embeddings using local models
2. `src/core/vector-store.ts` - Implements vector-based memory storage and similarity search

These complement existing components (memory.ts, search.ts, memory-extractor.ts) to create a more sophisticated memory system that can find semantically related memories, not just keyword matches. The MCP server's memory extraction pipeline (src/core/memory-extractor.ts) already uses Claude CLI for analysis and these new modules enhance the search and retrieval capabilities.
