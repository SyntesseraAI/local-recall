# Memory Extraction Guidelines

## What to Extract

Focus on extracting memories that will be useful for future AI assistants working on the codebase:

### DO Extract
- Architectural decisions and their reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns or conventions specific to this project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- User preferences discovered during the session
- Important relationships between components
- Performance considerations or optimizations

### DO NOT Extract
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps that aren't useful long-term
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that would become outdated quickly

## Scope Selection

- `global`: Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
- `file:<path>`: Specific to a particular file
- `area:<name>`: Related to a component or area (e.g., 'area:transcript-collector')

## Quality Standards

- **Be specific**: Include file paths, function names, concrete details
- **Be concise**: Focus on one concept per memory
- **Be actionable**: Help future assistants avoid mistakes or work more efficiently
