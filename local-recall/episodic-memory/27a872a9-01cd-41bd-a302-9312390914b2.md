The memory extraction system in `memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API to analyze session transcripts and extract valuable memories. It processes condensed transcripts with events marked as `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]`. The extraction is driven by a structured prompt in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` that guides Claude to identify architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and other long-term valuable insights. This approach automates knowledge preservation across sessions.
