The memory extraction process in `memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) with streaming to analyze transcripts and extract memories. The extraction includes analyzing user prompts, assistant responses, and tool usage to identify valuable knowledge that should be retained for future sessions. Streaming is used to handle potentially long transcripts efficiently.
