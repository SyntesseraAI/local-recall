The project's memory extraction process deliberately excludes temporary debugging steps, generic programming knowledge, and obvious information. Only actionable, long-term knowledge about the specific codebase is extracted. This prevents memory pollution and keeps the memory index focused on genuinely useful information for future sessions.
