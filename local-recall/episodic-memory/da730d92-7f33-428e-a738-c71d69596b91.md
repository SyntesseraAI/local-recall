The codebase includes transcript condensing functionality to reduce transcript size before passing to Claude for memory extraction. This is an optimization that:

1. Reduces API call costs by minimizing token usage
2. Focuses Claude's analysis on the most relevant parts of the transcript
3. Makes memory extraction faster and more efficient

This is implemented in conjunction with the memory-extractor system.
