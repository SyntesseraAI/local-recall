The transcript processing in `src/utils/transcript.ts` has been updated to:

1. Skip all user messages entirely (only process assistant responses)
2. Filter out single-line assistant messages (must have 2+ non-empty lines to be saved)
3. Store the content without role prefixes

This reduces noise in the memory system by focusing on substantive assistant responses and ignoring user input and brief assistant replies.
