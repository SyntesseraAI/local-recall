If encountering 'Tokenizer file not found' error: The embedding model cache may be corrupted (usually from interrupted download). Solution: Delete the cached model directory (rm -rf local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*) and the model will re-download automatically on next run. This is a known issue documented in CLAUDE.md troubleshooting section.
