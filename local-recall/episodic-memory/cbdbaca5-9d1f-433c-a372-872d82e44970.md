Memory extraction uses prompts defined in a separate module. This separation allows for:

- Easy iteration on prompt engineering without changing core logic
- Consistent prompt versioning and documentation
- Clear delineation between extraction logic and instruction design

The prompt module likely contains the system prompt that guides Claude in analyzing transcripts for memory-worthy content and formatting the results for the memory system.
