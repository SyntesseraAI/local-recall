Claude stores projects in ~/.claude/projects using a naming convention where the full file path has slashes replaced with dashes. For example, /Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall becomes -Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall. The transcripts (.jsonl files) are stored directly in the project folder, NOT in a transcripts/ subfolder. The TranscriptCollector must prioritize this path-to-dashes lookup method to correctly find projects and their transcripts.
