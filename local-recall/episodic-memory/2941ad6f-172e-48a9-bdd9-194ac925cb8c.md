Thinking memories capture Claude's reasoning paired with text output:

1. **Format** - Each thinking memory contains both the thought block and corresponding text output
2. **Tool-only responses skipped** - Responses containing only tool calls (no text) are not stored
3. **Semantic pairing** - The thought and output from the same response turn are stored together
4. **Practical examples** - Provides "how I reasoned → what I produced" examples for future sessions
5. **Retrieval** - Retrieved based on semantic similarity and token budget

This means thinking memories are only created for responses that produce actual text output, avoiding storage of intermediate reasoning that didn't lead to user-facing text.
