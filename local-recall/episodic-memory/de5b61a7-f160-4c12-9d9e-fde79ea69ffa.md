When the Claude CLI times out during keyword extraction, the hook should log contextual information to help with debugging:

1. **What should be logged**:
   - That a timeout occurred (not just a generic error)
   - How long the timeout was set to
   - That the search will proceed without keywords (fallback behavior)

2. **Why this matters**: Users and developers need to understand why memory search might not work optimally during a session - it's not a hard failure, just a graceful degradation.

3. **Logging location**: Use the logger utility to write to `recall.log` for persistent debugging information.
