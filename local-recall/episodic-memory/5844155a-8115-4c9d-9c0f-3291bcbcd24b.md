The vector store is implemented in src/core/vector-store.ts using better-sqlite3 with the sqlite-vec extension. It uses fastembed library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model (~133MB) for semantic search. The model is automatically cached in local_cache/ on first use. Scoring uses cosine distance (0.0-1.0 range, rounded to 2 decimals), with recency as tie-breaker when scores are equal.
