The memory extraction functionality is centralized in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts`. Prompt templates for extraction (keyword generation, memory generation, etc.) are stored in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This separation allows for easier testing and modification of extraction logic and prompts independently.
