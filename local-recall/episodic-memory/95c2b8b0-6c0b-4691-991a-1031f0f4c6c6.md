# Claude Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

Project folders are named by converting the absolute working directory path:
- Forward slashes `/` are replaced with dashes `-`
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

## Transcript Files

- Stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) format
- Located at `~/.claude/projects/{project-name}/transcripts/`
- Each line is a JSON object representing a transcript event
- Used by `transcript-collector.ts` to read and process transcripts from Claude's cache
