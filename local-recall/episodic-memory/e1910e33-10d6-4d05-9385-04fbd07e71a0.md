The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Anthropic Claude API (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) directly rather than relying on hooks or MCP tools. It processes transcripts using streaming mode with `stream: true` to handle potentially large transcripts efficiently. The extraction process uses a prompt template from `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to guide Claude in identifying valuable memories from session transcripts.
