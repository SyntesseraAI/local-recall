Three hooks integrate Local Recall with Claude Code:
1. **SessionStart**: Loads 5 most recent memories on session start (full reload, avoids slow vector store init)
2. **UserPromptSubmit**: Performs semantic search using vectors when user submits prompt (lazy vector store init)
3. **Stop**: Currently disabled - memory extraction is handled by MCP daemon every 5 minutes

Hooks are configured in hooks.json and execute as shell commands receiving/returning JSON via stdin/stdout.
