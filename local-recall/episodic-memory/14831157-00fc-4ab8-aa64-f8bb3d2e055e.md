When extracting memories from transcripts, the system must follow strict guidelines:

**DO extract:**
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Project-specific code patterns and conventions
- Configuration quirks and gotchas
- User preferences discovered during session
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations applied

**DO NOT extract:**
- Generic programming knowledge (already in Claude's training)
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that becomes outdated quickly

Memories use appropriate scope values:
- `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions)
- `file:<path>` - Specific to particular file
- `area:<name>` - Related to component or area (e.g., `area:authentication`)

Deduplication uses content_hash to prevent storing duplicate memories from the same session or different timestamps.
