The Local Recall system includes a memory extraction subsystem that processes Claude Code session transcripts to automatically extract valuable memories. These memories are created through the MCP server's background daemon, which syncs transcripts every 5 minutes and uses Claude to identify what should be remembered for future sessions. This enables the system to learn from past interactions and improve future assistance.
