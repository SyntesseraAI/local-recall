# Memory Extraction Session Analysis

When analyzing Claude Code session transcripts for memory extraction, the process involves:

1. **Context Understanding**: Knowing the working directory (`/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`) provides crucial context for memory scope and file path references

2. **Transcript Format Recognition**: Transcripts contain events formatted as:
   - `[User]` - User requests and questions
   - `[Assistant]` - Claude responses and explanations
   - `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, etc.)
   - `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcomes of tool calls

3. **[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL] Markers**: These markers indicate the memory extraction phase, where a condensed transcript is being analyzed

4. **Memory Extraction Goals**: Extract memories that are:
   - Specific to the codebase (not generic programming knowledge)
   - Actionable for future assistants
   - Appropriately scoped (global, file, or area)
   - Focused on architectural decisions, bug fixes, and patterns

This meta-knowledge helps ensure memories are extracted effectively and are useful for future sessions.
