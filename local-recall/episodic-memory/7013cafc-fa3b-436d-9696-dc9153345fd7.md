# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder name: `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Transcripts location: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with the pattern `transcript-*.jsonl`. Each line contains a JSON event object representing interactions in the session.

## Relevance

This is important for the MCP server's background daemon which syncs transcripts from this location every 5 minutes to extract and create memories automatically.
