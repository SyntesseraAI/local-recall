The memory extraction prompt defines how Claude Haiku should analyze transcripts and generate memories. It specifies the expected YAML frontmatter format with fields like `id`, `subject`, `keywords`, `applies_to`, `occurred_at`, and `content_hash`. The prompt guides Claude to extract valuable insights and architecture decisions from session transcripts, filtering out generic knowledge and temporary debugging steps.
