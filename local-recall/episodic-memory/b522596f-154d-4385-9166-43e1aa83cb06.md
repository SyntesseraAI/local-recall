The memory extractor includes several filtering mechanisms:
- Filters out memories with empty content
- Uses `findDuplicate()` to check for existing memories by content_hash and occurred_at
- Returns existing memory if duplicate detected instead of creating new one
- Handles errors gracefully with try-catch blocks
- Tracks which memories were newly created vs. already existed
