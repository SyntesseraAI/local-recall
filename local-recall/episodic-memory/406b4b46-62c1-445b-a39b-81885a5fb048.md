The transcript collection and memory extraction pipeline was refactored to use condensed versions of transcripts. The condensing process uses Claude Haiku with `claude -p` to summarize transcripts, which improves the quality of memories extracted while reducing token usage and processing overhead. This is particularly important for long sessions.
