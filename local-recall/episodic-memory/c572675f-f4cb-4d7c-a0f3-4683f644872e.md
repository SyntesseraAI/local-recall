# Claude Code Transcript Event Format

Claude Code stores session transcripts as `.jsonl` files where each line is a complete JSON object representing an event.

## Event Structure

Each event in the transcript has a consistent structure with the following properties:
- Timestamp information for ordering events
- Type field indicating the event category
- Content data specific to the event type
- Additional metadata for context

This format allows for efficient streaming and appending of new events without reparsing the entire file.
