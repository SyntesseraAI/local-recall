The memory extractor module in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the Claude API (Haiku model) to intelligently parse session transcripts and extract meaningful memories. It processes transcript events through a structured extraction pipeline that identifies key learnings, architectural decisions, bug fixes, and codebase-specific patterns. The extracted memories are then stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the episodic-memory directory.
