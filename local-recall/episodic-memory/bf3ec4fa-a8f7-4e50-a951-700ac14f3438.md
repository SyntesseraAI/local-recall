Transcripts are condensed into event summaries before being sent to Claude for memory extraction. This reduces token usage and focuses the extraction process on essential information. The condensed format uses markers like [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], and [Result: OK/ERROR] to represent transcript events in a compact form.
