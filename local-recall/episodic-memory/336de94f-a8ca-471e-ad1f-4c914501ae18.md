The memory extraction prompt is maintained as a separate module at `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` to ensure consistency across all memory extraction operations. This centralized approach allows for:

- Single source of truth for extraction guidelines
- Easy updates to extraction logic without modifying extractor code
- Consistent behavior across different extraction contexts
- Clear separation of concerns between prompt content and extraction logic

The prompt defines what constitutes valuable memories and how they should be formatted.
