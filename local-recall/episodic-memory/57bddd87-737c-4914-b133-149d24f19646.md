The processed log was refactored from JSON to JSONL (JSON Lines) format for better performance and cleaner append-only operations. Each line is a single JSON object with an `action` field ('add' or 'remove'). On load, the file is replayed to build the current state. A `compact()` method is available to clean up the file when needed. This makes the log append-only, faster to write, and easier to process incrementally.
