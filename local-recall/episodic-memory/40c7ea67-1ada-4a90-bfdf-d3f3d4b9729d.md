The MemoryExtractor class in src/core/memory-extractor.ts uses Claude (via the Anthropic SDK) to analyze session transcripts and automatically generate structured memory objects. It takes a transcript string, sends it to Claude with a specific extraction prompt from src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts, and parses the response to create memories via the memory manager. This enables asynchronous, intelligent extraction of memories without manual user input.
