The SessionStart hook in `src/hooks/session-start.ts` performs a full reload of memories from disk using `MemoryManager.listMemories()` without using the vector store. This avoids slow vector store initialization on every session start. Instead, it returns the 5 most recent memories (sorted by `occurred_at` timestamp) to provide context at the beginning of each session.
