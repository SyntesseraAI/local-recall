For consistency with episodic-memory, the thinking memories folder has been renamed:

- **Old**: `local-recall/thinking-memories/`
- **New**: `local-recall/thinking-memory/`

This change was made across:
- Actual folder structure: `local-recall/thinking-memory/`
- Source code references in `src/core/thinking-memory.ts`
- Documentation in `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/thinking-memories.md`, and `docs/mcp-server.md`
- Tests in `tests/unit/core/thinking-memory.test.ts`
- Episodic memory files that referenced the old path

The folder name is now consistent with the `episodic-memory/` directory naming pattern.
