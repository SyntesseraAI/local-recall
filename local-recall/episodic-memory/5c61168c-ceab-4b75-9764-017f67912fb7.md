The Local Recall system extracts memories from Claude Code session transcripts to preserve knowledge across sessions. Key aspects:

1. **Process**: Analysis identifies what was learned, known facts about the codebase, specific patterns discovered, and problems solved

2. **Guidelines**: Memories should be specific (include file paths, function names), concise (one concept per memory), and actionable (help future assistants avoid mistakes)

3. **Scope Selection**:
   - `global` - Applies to entire codebase (architecture, conventions, preferences)
   - `file:<path>` - Specific to particular files
   - `area:<name>` - Related to components or areas

4. **What to Extract**:
   - Architectural decisions and reasoning
   - Bug fixes and root cause analysis
   - Code patterns or conventions
   - Configuration quirks
   - User preferences
   - Component relationships
   - Performance optimizations

5. **What to Avoid**:
   - Generic programming knowledge
   - Temporary debugging steps
   - Obvious/trivial information
   - Sensitive data
   - Quickly-outdated information
