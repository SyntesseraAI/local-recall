The memory extraction instructions are centralized in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This file contains:

- The detailed system prompt for Claude to extract memories from transcripts
- Instructions on what constitutes a valuable memory
- Guidelines for scope determination (global, file:, area:)
- Format requirements for extracted memories
- The prompt is imported and used by the memory-extractor module

This centralized approach makes it easy to refine extraction quality without modifying the extraction logic.
