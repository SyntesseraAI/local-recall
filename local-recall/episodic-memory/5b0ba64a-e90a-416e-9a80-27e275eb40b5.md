Local Recall enables Claude Code and other AI tools via MCP to retain information and context across sessions through structured markdown files. All memories are stored locally within the repository as version-controllable markdown files with YAML frontmatter, making them shareable among team members.

**Architecture Overview:**
- Core memory management in `src/core/` with CRUD operations, vector store with SQLite + embeddings, and semantic search
- Claude Code hooks in `src/hooks/` for SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, and Stop events
- MCP server in `src/mcp-server/` exposing memory tools
- Memory files stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` as version-controlled markdown
- SQLite database and embeddings cache are gitignored and auto-generated

**Memory File Format:**
Each memory is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing: id (UUID), subject, keywords (array), applies_to (global/file/area scope), occurred_at (ISO-8601 timestamp), and content_hash (SHA-256 prefix).
