The local-recall system is designed to analyze Claude Code session transcripts and extract valuable memories that help future AI assistants working on the codebase. The memory extraction process:

1. **Transcript Processing**: Analyzes condensed session transcripts with events marked as `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, and `[Tool]`
2. **Memory Identification**: Identifies architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and project-specific knowledge
3. **Structured Storage**: Stores memories in markdown format with YAML frontmatter containing metadata
4. **Scope-Aware**: Classifies memories as `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>` based on applicability
5. **Actionable Content**: Focuses on information that helps future assistants avoid mistakes and work more efficiently

Memories should exclude generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, and trivial information, focusing only on codebase-specific insights.
