The prompting logic for memory extraction is separated into a dedicated prompts module (src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts). This allows for maintaining consistent and well-structured instructions for Claude Haiku when analyzing transcripts. The separation keeps prompting logic separate from the core extraction implementation, making it easier to iterate on prompts without modifying the main extraction code.
