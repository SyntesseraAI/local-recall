# Transcript Context Accumulation

When processing transcripts:
1. Messages should be accumulated chronologically to build conversation context
2. The most recent user message typically represents the current task or question
3. Previous messages provide historical context that may be relevant to memory extraction
4. Tool invocations (embedded in assistant messages) show what actions were taken

This is important for `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` to understand the full scope of what happened in a session, not just isolated events.
