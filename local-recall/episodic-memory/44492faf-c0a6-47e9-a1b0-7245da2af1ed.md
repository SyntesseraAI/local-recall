The MCP server includes a background daemon that automatically processes Claude transcripts:

**Process:**
1. Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
2. Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
3. Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
4. Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
5. Runs every 5 minutes

**Note:** This replaced the Stop hook approach for more reliable, asynchronous memory extraction. Stop hook is currently disabled.
