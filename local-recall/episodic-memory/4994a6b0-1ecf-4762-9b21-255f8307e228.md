# Memory Files and Git

## What Gets Tracked

Actual memory files (`local-recall/episodic-memory/*.md`) ARE version-controlled and will be committed to git.

## What Gets Ignored

These are gitignored and auto-generated:
- `local-recall/index.json` - Keyword index (rebuilt at runtime)
- `local-recall/recall.log` - Debug log file
- `local_cache/` - Embedding model cache

## Implications

When extracting memories:
- They become permanent project artifacts
- Multiple team members can share and see the memories
- The CLAUDE.md guidance states: "Memory files ARE version-controlled - they will be committed to git"
- Should only extract valuable, long-term relevant memories
