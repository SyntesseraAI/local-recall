# Transcript Condensing Strategy

The transcript condensing feature (in `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`) is designed to reduce token usage when processing transcripts by removing redundant context while preserving important content. Key considerations:

- Remove duplicate/repeated context between consecutive tool invocations
- Preserve file contents, error messages, and tool results that are necessary for understanding what happened
- Keep the narrative structure clear about what was attempted and why
- The condensing happens before memories are extracted to avoid processing unnecessary information

This allows the transcript-to-memory extraction process to work efficiently even with long sessions.
