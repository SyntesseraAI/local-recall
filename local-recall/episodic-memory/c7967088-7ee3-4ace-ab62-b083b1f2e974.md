The processed transcript log should be refactored to use JSONL (JSON Lines) format instead of the current format. This change will:
- Make the log cleaner and easier to parse
- Enable faster read/write operations
- Support append-only semantics naturally (one JSON object per line)
- Improve deduplication checks and change detection

This is relevant to the MCP server's background daemon that tracks processed transcripts and extracts memories.
