The memory extraction process analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to identify valuable insights and discoveries that should be preserved for future AI assistants. Key aspects:

- Transcripts are condensed into events (User, Assistant, Tool, Result)
- Memories should be specific, concise, and actionable
- Each memory focuses on one concept or discovery
- Use appropriate scope: global, file:<path>, or area:<name>
- Extract architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configurations, and preferences
- Do NOT extract generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, or sensitive data
