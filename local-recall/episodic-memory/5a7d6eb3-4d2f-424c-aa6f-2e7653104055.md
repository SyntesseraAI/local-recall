# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Encoding

Project folder names encode the absolute working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes and starting with a hash:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Encoded project path: `#Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`
- Full transcript directory: `~/.claude/projects/#Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/transcripts/`

## Transcript Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files with `.jsonl` extension containing individual conversation events in JSON format.

## Significance

This path encoding is important for:
- Understanding how Claude Code organizes project-specific data
- Building tools that need to locate and process transcripts
- Syncing transcripts from Claude's cache to Local Recall's processing system
