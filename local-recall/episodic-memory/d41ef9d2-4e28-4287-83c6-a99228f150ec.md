Claude Code stores transcript files in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The project folder name is the working directory path with slashes replaced by dashes (e.g., `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`). Transcript files are stored as JSONL format where each line is a JSON object representing an event in the transcript.
