The memory-extractor is part of Local Recall's transcript processing system. It processes session transcripts after a Claude Code session ends and extracts valuable memories that help future AI assistants. The system is used by the MCP daemon which periodically processes transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`. Memories are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `local-recall/episodic-memory/`.
