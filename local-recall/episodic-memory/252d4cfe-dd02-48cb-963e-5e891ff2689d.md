# Claude Transcript File Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` with directory names that are URL-encoded versions of the project path.

## Path Structure
- Base directory: `~/.claude/projects/`
- Subdirectory: URL-encoded version of the project path
- Files: `.jsonl` format (one JSON object per line)
- Example: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` → `%2FUsers%2Fjoe%2FCode%2FSyntessera%2Flocal-recall`

## Implications
- Transcripts are stored in Claude's cache, not in the project repository
- The MCP server needs to decode URL-encoded paths to match project directories
- File modification times can be used to detect new/updated transcripts
- Each line in the `.jsonl` file is a complete JSON event object

## Usage in local-recall
The transcript collector in the MCP server uses this path structure to:
1. Find the correct transcript directory for the current project
2. Detect transcript changes via file modification times
3. Parse `.jsonl` files to extract session events
4. Process transcripts to extract memories
