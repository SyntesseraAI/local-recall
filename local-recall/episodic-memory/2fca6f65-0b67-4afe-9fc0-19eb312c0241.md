# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes and a hash appended. For example:
- Project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcripts stored in `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u/transcripts/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) files with the naming convention: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.jsonl`

Each line is a JSON object representing an event in the conversation.

## Usage in Local Recall

This is important for the MCP server's background daemon which:
1. Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache
2. Processes transcripts to extract memories
3. Tracks changes using content hashes
4. Runs every 5 minutes to pick up new transcripts
