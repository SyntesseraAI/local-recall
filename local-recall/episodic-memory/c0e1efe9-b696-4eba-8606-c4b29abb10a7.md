The Stop hook is not triggered by the VS Code extension, preventing automatic memory creation from transcripts. This differs from Claude Code CLI which reliably triggers the Stop hook. The Stop hook (src/hooks/stop.ts) is responsible for parsing transcripts and creating episodic memories, but without its execution, memories must be created via MCP tools or manual intervention.

Memory creation pipeline:
1. Stop hook fires (parses transcript, creates memories) - NOT HAPPENING IN VSCODE
2. MCP server daemon processes transcripts every 5 minutes (alternative path)
3. Manual creation via memory_create MCP tool

For VS Code users, relying on the MCP server daemon or direct tool usage is necessary.
