The MemoryExtractor class in memory-extractor.ts uses the Anthropic Claude API with message streaming to extract memories from transcripts. It takes a transcript string, sends it through the memory extraction prompt, and yields memory objects as they stream back from the API. This approach is more efficient than waiting for the full response before processing.
