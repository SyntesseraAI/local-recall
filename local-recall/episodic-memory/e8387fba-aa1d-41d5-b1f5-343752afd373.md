# Memory Extraction and Keyword Extraction

The memory extraction process uses Claude Haiku to intelligently extract keywords from transcript events.

## Keyword Extraction Process

1. When extracting memories from transcripts, each memory needs searchable keywords
2. Keywords are extracted by passing transcript event content to Claude Haiku
3. Haiku analyzes the content and returns a JSON array of relevant keywords
4. These keywords enable fuzzy search matching to retrieve relevant memories

## Why Haiku

Claude Haiku is chosen for keyword extraction because:
- Fast inference suitable for real-time keyword extraction
- Cost-effective for frequent calls during memory extraction
- Sufficient capability for identifying relevant keywords from text
- Can understand context and extract semantically meaningful keywords
