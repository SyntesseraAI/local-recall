Removed `ts-textrank` npm package and replaced with simple logic:
- For multi-line text: take the first line
- For single-line text: take up to first `.` or all text if no period

This eliminates external dependency while maintaining useful subject extraction. Applied to both `generateSubject` in summarize.ts and transcript.ts.
