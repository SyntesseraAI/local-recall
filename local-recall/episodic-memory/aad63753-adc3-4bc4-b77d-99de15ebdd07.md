When extracting memories from transcripts, the tool representations should include the tool name and parameters. The MCP server daemon processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes, extracting memories using Claude Haiku. Tool invocations in the condensed transcript format help Claude understand what operations were performed during the session, which is important context for determining what memories should be created.
