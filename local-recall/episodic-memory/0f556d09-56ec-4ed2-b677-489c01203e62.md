## Implementation
The memory extractor includes transcript condensing logic that:
1. Identifies verbose explanatory text in Claude's responses
2. Replaces multi-sentence explanations with brief summaries
3. Keeps essential information: code changes, decisions, and findings
4. Reduces token count sent to the extraction model

## Purpose
Reduces the size of transcript input passed to Claude for memory extraction, improving performance and reducing API costs while preserving essential context for memory creation.
