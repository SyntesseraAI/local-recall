Memory files stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/*.md` are version-controlled and committed to git. The SQLite database (`memory.sqlite`) and debug log (`recall.log`) are gitignored and auto-generated. This allows team members to share memories and see the project's learning history through git commits.
