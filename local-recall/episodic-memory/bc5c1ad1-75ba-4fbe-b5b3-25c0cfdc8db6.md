Multiple documentation files (docs/architecture.md, docs/hooks.md, docs/mcp-server.md, docs/memory-format.md, docs/configuration.md) had inconsistencies with actual source code. Regular audits are needed to ensure documentation stays current with implementation changes. Key areas that drift: component descriptions, file paths, API signatures, and feature status.
