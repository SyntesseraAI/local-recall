The memory extraction process includes a transcript condensing step before sending to Claude for analysis. This condensing improves processing efficiency by reducing unnecessary verbosity while preserving all meaningful information needed for memory extraction. The condensed format uses markers like `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, and `[Result: OK/ERROR]` to structure the transcript in a more compact, machine-readable format that Claude can efficiently process.
