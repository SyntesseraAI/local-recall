Claude stores project transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` directory. The project folder naming convention encodes the absolute path: forward slashes are replaced with hyphens. For example, `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall` becomes `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`. This naming scheme allows the MCP server to reverse-map from folder names back to absolute paths for accurate transcript syncing and memory extraction across projects.
