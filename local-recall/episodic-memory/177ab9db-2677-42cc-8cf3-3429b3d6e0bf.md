Updated build scripts in `package.json` to remove references to the deleted `user-prompt-submit-thinking.ts` hook:
- Removed `hooks:user-prompt-submit-thinking` npm script
- Updated `build:scripts` to only include remaining hook files

This ensures the build process doesn't fail when trying to compile the deleted hook file.
