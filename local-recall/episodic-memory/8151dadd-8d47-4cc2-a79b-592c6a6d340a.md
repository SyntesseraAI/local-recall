The `MemoryExtractor` class in src/core/memory-extractor.ts is responsible for analyzing session transcripts and extracting valuable memories using the Claude API. It processes condensed transcripts containing events like [User], [Assistant], and [Tool] entries, then uses Claude to identify and structure memories based on specific extraction prompts.
