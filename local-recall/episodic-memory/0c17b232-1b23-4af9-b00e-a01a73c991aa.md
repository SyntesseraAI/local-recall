# Memory Extraction and Deduplication

The memory extraction process:

1. **Transcript Condensing**: Transcripts are condensed into key events before analysis to reduce token usage
2. **Deduplication**: Memories are deduplicated using two fields:
   - `occurred_at`: ISO-8601 timestamp from the original transcript event
   - `content_hash`: SHA-256 prefix (16 chars) of the memory content
3. **Idempotent Creation**: The `createMemory()` function checks for duplicates and returns the existing memory if found

This prevents duplicate memories when the same transcript is processed multiple times or when similar memories are created from different sessions.
