The memory-extractor.ts module uses the Anthropic Claude API (claude-opus-4-1 model) to extract memories from transcripts. It sends transcript content with a system prompt to guide Claude in identifying and structuring valuable memories. The system prompt instructs Claude to extract memories based on what was learned, what is now known, what is specific to the codebase, and what problems were solved. This approach leverages Claude's understanding to automatically generate structured memories from session transcripts.
