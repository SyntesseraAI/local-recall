Thinking memories capture thought+output pairs: the `## Thought` section contains Claude's reasoning, and the `## Output` section contains the text response that followed. These are extracted from transcripts and enable future sessions to learn from how Claude reasoned through similar problems. Tool-only responses (no text output) are skipped during extraction. Thinking memories help demonstrate "how I thought → what I produced" patterns.
