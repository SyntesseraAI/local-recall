# Claude Transcript JSONL Format

Claude Code stores transcripts as JSONL (JSON Lines) files where each line is a separate event object.

## Event Structure

Each event has:
- `type`: The event type (e.g., "user_message", "assistant_message", "tool_use", "tool_result")
- `timestamp`: ISO-8601 formatted timestamp when the event occurred
- Content fields vary by type:
  - User messages: `content` field with the user's text
  - Assistant messages: `content` field with Claude's response
  - Tool uses: `tool_name`, `tool_input` fields
  - Tool results: `status` and result content

## Timestamp Format

Timestamps are ISO-8601 strings (e.g., "2024-12-01T18:42:29.638Z") and can be parsed with `new Date(timestamp)`.

## Relevance

The transcript-collector needs to parse these JSONL files correctly to extract memories. Understanding the event structure helps identify which events contain useful information for memory extraction.
