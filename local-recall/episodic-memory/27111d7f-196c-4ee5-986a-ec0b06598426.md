The project maintains extraction prompts in a dedicated file `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. These prompts define the criteria for what should and should not be extracted as memories, including guidelines for being specific, concise, actionable, and choosing appropriate scope (global, file-specific, or area-specific).
