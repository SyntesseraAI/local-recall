Transcript condensing is a preprocessing step that:

1. Filters out verbose tool output (Result: OK/ERROR messages)
2. Removes intermediate tool invocation details that don't contribute to understanding session outcomes
3. Preserves user requests, assistant explanations, and important tool invocations
4. Reduces context length for the LLM while maintaining semantic meaning

This is critical because:
- Raw transcripts can be very large with repetitive tool output
- Claude Haiku (used for extraction) has limited context
- The condensed version focuses on decisions and learning rather than execution details
