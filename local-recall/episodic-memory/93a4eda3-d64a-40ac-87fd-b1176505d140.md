Development guidelines:

- All new features must have unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests go in `tests/integration/`
- Documentation must be placed in `docs/` folder
- Update existing docs when modifying functionality
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases
- Use npm scripts: `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run mcp:start`
