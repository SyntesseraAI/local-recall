Observed that thinking memory search was successfully injecting relevant excerpts with 67% similarity threshold. Multiple excerpts about memory list updates and memory-worthy content detection were correctly identified and injected into Claude's context under 'Local Recall: Previous Thoughts' heading.

This indicates the thinking memory vector search is functioning effectively at capturing conceptually-related thoughts from previous sessions, even though the similarity scores are not extremely high. Consider this baseline when tuning thinking memory similarity thresholds.
