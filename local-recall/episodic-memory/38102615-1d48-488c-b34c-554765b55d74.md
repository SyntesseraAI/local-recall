The LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL memory extraction process is designed to capture:

- **Architectural decisions** and their reasoning
- **Bug fixes** with root cause analysis
- **Code patterns** or conventions specific to the project
- **Configuration quirks** or gotchas discovered
- **User preferences** and working patterns
- **Important relationships** between components
- **Performance optimizations** applied

Memories are marked with appropriate scope (global for codebase-wide, file:path for specific files, area:name for components) to make them discoverable in future sessions. Each memory should be specific, concise, and actionable rather than generic programming knowledge.
