The TranscriptCollector class processes transcript chunks (which may be incomplete or fragmented) and consolidates them into complete [User] and [Assistant] event pairs. This ensures that memory extraction operates on complete, coherent events rather than partial chunks, improving memory quality and reducing extraction errors.
