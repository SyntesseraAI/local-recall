Memory files are stored in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` directory (renamed from `memories/` in earlier commits). These markdown files ARE version-controlled and tracked in git. Each memory is a standalone markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash). The `local-recall/.gitignore` file excludes only `index.json` and `recall.log`, allowing memory files to be committed.
