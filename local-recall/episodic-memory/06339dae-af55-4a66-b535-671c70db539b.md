# Memory Extraction Context Requirements

When extracting memories from transcripts, single events are insufficient for generating quality memories. The extraction process needs:

## Context Needed

1. **Multi-turn conversation history** - Understanding what was asked, tried, and discovered across multiple turns
2. **Problem-solution pairs** - The full context of what problem was identified and how it was solved
3. **Tool invocation sequence** - Understanding what tools were used, what they revealed, and how the results informed next steps
4. **User intent and feedback** - What the user was trying to accomplish and their reactions to proposed solutions

## Why Single Events Are Insufficient

A single `ToolResult` event showing an error doesn't provide enough context to:
- Understand what was being investigated
- Know why the error occurred
- Capture how it was resolved
- Determine if it's a useful memory

## Recommendation

Memory extraction should process consolidated session transcripts that group related events, not individual tool invocations. The current approach of processing individual events loses critical context needed to generate actionable, specific memories.
