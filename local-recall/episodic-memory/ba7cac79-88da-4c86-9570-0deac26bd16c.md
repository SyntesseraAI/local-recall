The transcript collector processes Claude Code session transcripts and condenses them into a structured event format:

- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This condensed format reduces token usage while preserving the essential context needed for memory extraction. The collector identifies what was learned, what is now known, codebase-specific patterns, and problems that were solved during the session.
