All new features must include:
- Unit tests in tests/unit/ directory
- Integration tests in tests/integration/ directory
- Documentation in docs/ folder
- Updates to existing docs when modifying functionality
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases

Use npm run build to compile TypeScript, npm run test to run tests, npm run dev for watch mode.
