The project implements transcript condensing before memory extraction to improve token efficiency. This process filters out less relevant events (like tool execution details) while preserving the main conversation flow, question-answer pairs, and key decisions. This reduces the amount of data sent to Claude Haiku during memory extraction, lowering costs and processing time.
