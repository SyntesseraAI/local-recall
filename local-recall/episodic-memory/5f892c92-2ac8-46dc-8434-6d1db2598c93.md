The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses the `claude -p` command-line tool to analyze transcripts and extract memories. It constructs a system prompt and user prompt, then passes them to claude to generate structured memory objects. The system prompt defines the extraction task and constraints, while the user prompt contains the actual transcript content to analyze.
