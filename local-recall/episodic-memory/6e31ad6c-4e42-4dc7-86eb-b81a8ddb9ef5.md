The MCP server includes a background daemon that:
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/transcripts/`)
- Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Deletes and recreates memories when transcripts change
- Runs every 5 minutes for asynchronous processing

The daemon allows memory extraction to happen without blocking session stop operations, unlike the disabled Stop hook which would cause session delays.
