The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model with streaming enabled to analyze session transcripts and extract memories. The extraction process:

1. Takes a transcript as input
2. Uses the prompt defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`
3. Streams the response from Claude Haiku for real-time processing
4. Parses the streamed JSON output to extract individual memories

This streaming approach allows for efficient processing of large transcripts without waiting for the entire response.
