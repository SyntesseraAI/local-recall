Local Recall uses fastembed with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model for semantic search. The model automatically downloads to local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/ on first use (takes 30-60 seconds). Subsequent runs load from cache, making them fast. If tokenizer file not found error occurs, the cache is corrupted and should be deleted to force re-download.
