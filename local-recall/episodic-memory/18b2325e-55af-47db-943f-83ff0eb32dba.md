The vector store implements semantic search with these characteristics:
- **Similarity Scoring**: Cosine distance (0.0 = no match, 1.0 = identical)
- **Precision**: Scores rounded to 2 decimal places (e.g., 0.65)
- **Sorting**: Results sorted by score descending
- **Tie-breaking**: When scores are equal, more recent memories (`occurred_at`) are ranked first

This ranking strategy ensures that functionally similar but newer information takes precedence when vector similarity is equivalent.
