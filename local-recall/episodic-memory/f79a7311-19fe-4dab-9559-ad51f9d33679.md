The current keyword-based search is insufficient for effective memory extraction and retrieval. The project needs to implement embedding-based semantic search using the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (already available in the project). This would enable:

1. Better memory relevance matching beyond keyword overlap
2. Ability to find memories related to concepts without exact keyword matches
3. More accurate memory ranking for user queries
4. Support for transcript-to-memory matching during memory extraction

The infrastructure is already partially in place (embedding.ts and vector-store.ts files exist), but integration is incomplete.
