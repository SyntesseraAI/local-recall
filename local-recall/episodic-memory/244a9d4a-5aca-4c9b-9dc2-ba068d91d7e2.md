# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is derived from the absolute path with special character conversion:
- Forward slashes (`/`) are replaced with dashes (`-`)
- The path includes the full absolute path from root

Example:
- Working directory: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Transcript folder: `~/.claude/projects/Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall/`

## File Format

Transcripts are stored as JSONL files (one JSON object per line) in the transcripts directory:
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/transcripts/`
- File extension: `.jsonl`
- Each line contains a complete JSON transcript event

## Usage in Local Recall

The transcript collector uses this information to:
1. Find transcripts for the current project
2. Parse JSONL files to extract memory-worthy events
3. Track processed transcripts using content hashes for deduplication
