The local-recall system includes a transcript condensing feature that transforms verbose Claude Code transcripts into a compact event-based format:

- Format: `[User]`, `[Assistant]`, `[Tool: Name]`, `[Result: OK/ERROR]`
- Reduces transcript size significantly for processing
- Makes it easier for the memory extraction system to analyze what happened
- Is used as input to the memory extraction pipeline before sending to Claude for analysis

This condensing step improves efficiency of memory extraction by reducing token usage and focusing on key events.
