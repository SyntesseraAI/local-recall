When extracting memories:
- Be specific with file paths, function names, and concrete details
- Focus on one concept per memory
- Use appropriate scope: `global` (codebase-wide), `file:<path>` (specific file), `area:<name>` (component)
- Extract: architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, configurations, user preferences, component relationships
- Avoid: generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, trivial info, sensitive data, outdated information
