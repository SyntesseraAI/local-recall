When extracting memories from transcripts, the system explicitly avoids:
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows this)
- Temporary debugging steps that aren't useful long-term
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that would become outdated quickly

This ensures extracted memories remain actionable and valuable for future sessions.
