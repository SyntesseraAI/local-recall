SessionStart hook loads 5 most recent memories on session start (no vector store, full reload). UserPromptSubmit hook runs semantic search on user prompts with lazy vector store initialization. Stop hook is disabled - memory extraction handled by MCP server daemon processing transcripts every 5 minutes asynchronously. Hooks receive JSON via stdin with session_id, transcript_path, cwd.
