Local Recall processes transcripts in a condensed event-based format:

- `[User]` - User requests or questions
- `[Assistant]` - Claude's responses and explanations
- `[Tool: Name]` - Tool invocations (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
- `[Result: OK/ERROR]` - Outcome of tool invocations

This format is more compact than raw transcripts and makes it easier for Claude to analyze what happened during a session. The memory extractor parses this format to identify what was learned, what problems were solved, and what is now known about the codebase.
