Each extracted memory includes metadata fields: subject (brief description), keywords (searchable terms), applies_to (scope), and occurred_at (timestamp). These fields enable effective indexing, searching, and scoping of memories to relevant parts of the codebase. The metadata structure is critical for the memory system's functionality.
