The repository is on branch `claude/refactor-memory-collection-01HQY8jXfJm7zh35BcYYiE1u` with significant refactoring in progress. Key changes include:
- Renamed 'memories' directory to 'episodic-memory' across the project

- Modified memory extraction and search functionality
- Both staged and unstaged changes exist
- Tests have been updated to match new architecture
Recommendation: Review and test thoroughly before merging to main.
