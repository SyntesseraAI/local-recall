The memory-extractor module uses Claude's API (via `claude -p` command) to process session transcripts and extract structured memories. It sends prompts through the `extractMemoriesFromTranscript` function which calls Claude with a custom prompt to identify and structure memories from transcript text. The extracted memories are then validated and stored with proper frontmatter.
