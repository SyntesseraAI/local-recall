# Memory Extraction Process

The memory extraction system analyzes Claude Code session transcripts to create persistent memories that help future AI assistants.

## Key Principles

- Memories should be **specific** with concrete details (file paths, function names)
- Memories should be **concise** focusing on one concept
- Memories should be **actionable** to help avoid mistakes or work efficiently
- Scope determines applicability: `global`, `file:<path>`, or `area:<name>`

## What to Extract

✓ DO extract:
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions
- Configuration quirks
- User preferences
- Component relationships
- Performance optimizations

✗ DO NOT extract:
- Generic programming knowledge
- Temporary debugging steps
- Obvious/trivial information
- Sensitive data
- Quick-to-outdated information
