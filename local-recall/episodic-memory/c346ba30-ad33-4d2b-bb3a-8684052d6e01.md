# Vector Index Storage: JSON Files

Orama vector indexes are persisted as JSON files in the local-recall directory.

## Index Files
- `orama-episodic-index.json`: Vector index for episodic memories
- `orama-thinking-index.json`: Vector index for thinking memories

## Properties
- Auto-generated and gitignored (should not be committed)
- Rebuilt automatically when memories change
- JSON format allows inspection but not meant for manual editing
- Cleared when memory storage is restructured

## Configuration
- Indexes are initialized on first access
- sync() method keeps index in sync with memory files
- persist() method saves index to disk
- Embeddings are generated via Ollama on-demand

These index files are temporary and can be deleted safely - they will be rebuilt on next access.
