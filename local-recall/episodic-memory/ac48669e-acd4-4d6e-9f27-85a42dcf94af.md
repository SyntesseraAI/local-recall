Memory extraction uses centralized prompt templates stored in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts`. This allows for version control of prompt improvements and makes it easier to test and refine how memories are extracted from transcripts. The prompt should guide Claude Haiku to identify key concepts, generate relevant keywords, and produce clear, concise memory content that will be useful for future sessions.
