The memory extraction system in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` uses Claude Haiku model to intelligently parse session transcripts and extract meaningful memories. The extraction prompt is defined in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` and instructs the model to identify what was learned, problems solved, architectural decisions, and important discoveries. The system produces structured JSON output with memories containing subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and content fields. This approach leverages Claude's language understanding to identify valuable memories rather than simple heuristic-based extraction.
