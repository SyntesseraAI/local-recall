parseTranscriptForMemories(rawContent: string) at line 377 is the main exported function for processing raw JSONL transcript files. It: (1) splits by newlines, (2) parses each line as JSON, (3) filters for user/assistant messages, (4) extracts content and thinking from content blocks, (5) calls analyzeForMemories() to convert to memory suggestions. This is the pattern to follow when processing transcripts from any source.
