**SessionStart Hook**: Triggered when session begins, loads memory index from local-recall/index.json and outputs relevant memories to inject into Claude's context.

**UserPromptSubmit Hook**: Triggered before Claude processes user prompt, extracts keywords from prompt and searches memory index for matching keywords via fuzzy matching.

**Stop Hook**: Currently disabled. Memory extraction is handled asynchronously by MCP server daemon which processes transcripts every 5 minutes, allowing it to track content hashes for change detection.
