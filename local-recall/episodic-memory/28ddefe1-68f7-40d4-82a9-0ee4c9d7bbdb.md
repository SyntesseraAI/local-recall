The memory extraction process relies on a carefully crafted system prompt that defines guidelines for what should and shouldn't be extracted as memories. The prompt instructs Claude on distinguishing between valuable architectural knowledge, bug fixes, and code patterns versus generic programming knowledge or temporary debugging steps. This prompt-driven approach ensures consistent, high-quality memory extraction across sessions.
