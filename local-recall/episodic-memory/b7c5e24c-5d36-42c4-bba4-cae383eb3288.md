Current implementation stores embeddings only in the Orama index (orama-episodic-index.json, orama-thinking-index.json) files. Expected behavior: embeddings should be persisted within the JSONL files themselves as a field in each record. This ensures embeddings are part of the versioned memory storage, not just in the gitignored index files, improving portability and reproducibility.
