The extraction prompt explicitly instructs Claude to exclude:
- Generic programming knowledge (Claude already knows)
- Temporary debugging steps not useful long-term
- Obvious or trivial information
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Information that would become outdated quickly

This filtering ensures memories are focused, actionable, and maintain high signal-to-noise ratio.
