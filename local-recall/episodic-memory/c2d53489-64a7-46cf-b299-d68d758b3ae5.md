The memory extraction system uses Claude Haiku model to analyze session transcripts. The extraction is driven by a detailed prompt in src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts that instructs Claude how to identify valuable memories from transcripts. Key aspects:

- Uses `claude -p --model haiku` to extract memories from condensed transcripts
- The prompt guides Claude to identify architectural decisions, bug fixes, code patterns, and configuration quirks
- Memories are validated to ensure they contain specific details (file paths, function names, etc.)
- The system filters out generic knowledge and temporary debugging steps
- Generated memories follow the standard format with subject, keywords, applies_to scope, and markdown content
