Local Recall uses `fastembed` library with BGE-small-en-v1.5 model (~133MB) for semantic search. Model is automatically downloaded to `local_cache/` on first use. First run takes 30-60 seconds while model downloads; subsequent runs load from cache. If tokenizer error occurs, remove `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5*` to force re-download.
