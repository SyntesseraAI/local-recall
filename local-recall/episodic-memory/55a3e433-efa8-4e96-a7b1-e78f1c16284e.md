The memory extractor in `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` is responsible for processing session transcripts and extracting valuable memories. It uses the Claude API (via claude-sdk) to analyze transcripts and generate memories based on a predefined prompt. The extractor handles transcript condensing to create summaries that focus on key events and learnings rather than full transcript content.
