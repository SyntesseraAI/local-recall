Claude Code integration uses three hooks configured in `hooks.json`:
1. **SessionStart**: Loads 5 most recent memories on session start (full reload, no vector store)
2. **UserPromptSubmit**: Performs semantic search on user prompt using vector embeddings (lazy initialization)
3. **Stop**: Disabled - memory extraction handled by MCP server daemon every 5 minutes

Hooks receive JSON input with `session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd` and output memory content to stdout for context injection.
