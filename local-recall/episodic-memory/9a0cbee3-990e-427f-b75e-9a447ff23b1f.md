When extracting memories from transcripts, focus on:
- Architectural decisions and reasoning
- Bug fixes and root cause analysis
- Code patterns and conventions specific to the project
- Configuration quirks or gotchas
- Important component relationships
- Performance optimizations

Avoid extracting generic programming knowledge, temporary debugging steps, or information that becomes outdated quickly.
