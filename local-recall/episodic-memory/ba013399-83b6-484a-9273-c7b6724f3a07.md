The `ThinkingExtractor` requires initialization before being called in the daemon:
1. `getThinkingVectorStore()` must be initialized first
2. `ThinkingMemoryManager` must be instantiated
3. `runThinkingExtraction()` is then invoked with these initialized components

This is done in the daemon loop in `src/mcp-server/server.ts` to ensure the thinking extractor has all required dependencies before execution.
