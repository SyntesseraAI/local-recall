Before sending transcripts to Claude for memory extraction, the transcript is condensed using a separate condenser component. This reduces the amount of content Claude needs to process, lowering token usage and improving efficiency. The condensed transcript format uses structured events like [User], [Assistant], [Tool: Name], and [Result: OK/ERROR] to represent the session in a compact form.
