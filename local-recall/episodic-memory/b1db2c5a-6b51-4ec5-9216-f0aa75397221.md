The `processed-log.json` file (or `.jsonl` variants for different memory types) tracks which transcripts have been processed by the memory extraction daemon. This prevents re-processing the same transcripts and allows change detection. The file should be in the `local-recall` folder root and must be gitignored since it's auto-generated by the daemon.
