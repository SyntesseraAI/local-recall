# Claude Project Transcripts Location

Claude Code stores project transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/` on macOS.

## Path Format

The project folder name is the absolute path with slashes replaced by dashes and encoded with base32.

### Example

For the project at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`:
- The transcript directory would be at `~/.claude/projects/<base32-encoded-path>/transcripts/`
- Transcripts are stored as `.jsonl` files
- Each line is a JSON object representing a transcript event

## Relevance

This path is crucial for the MCP server's transcript collector, which needs to locate and process Claude's session transcripts to extract memories from ongoing sessions.
