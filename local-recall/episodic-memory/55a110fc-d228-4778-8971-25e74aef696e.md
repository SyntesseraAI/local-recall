Memory creation is idempotent - `createMemory()` checks for existing duplicates using both `occurred_at` (timestamp when event occurred) and `content_hash` (SHA-256 prefix). If a duplicate is found, the existing memory is returned instead of creating a new one. This prevents duplicate memories when transcripts are reprocessed.
