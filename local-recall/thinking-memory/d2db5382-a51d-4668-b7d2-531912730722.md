The user wants to proceed with removing update and delete memory functionality. Let me create a plan and start implementing.

The changes needed are:
1. Update types.ts - add occurred_at and content_hash to schemas
2. Update memory.ts - add hash computation, dedup check in createMemory(), remove updateMemory() and deleteMemory()
3. Update stop.ts - remove time window filtering, process entire transcript
4. Update MCP tools.ts - remove memory_update and memory_delete tools
5. Update MCP server.ts - remove handlers for update/delete
6. Update any tests that reference update/delete
7. Update documentation

Let me start implementing this.
