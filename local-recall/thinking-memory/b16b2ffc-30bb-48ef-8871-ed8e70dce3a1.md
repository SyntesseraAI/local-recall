## Thought

The user wants to test for mutex errors. Based on the CLAUDE.md documentation, there's a known issue with "mutex lock failed: Invalid argument" errors that occur when multiple processes load sqlite-vec concurrently. This is why the hook-daemon architecture was implemented.

Let me search for any existing tests or information about mutex errors in the codebase, and then help the user test for this.

## Output

I'll help you test for mutex errors. Based on the CLAUDE.md, the concern is about "mutex lock failed: Invalid argument" errors that occur when multiple processes load sqlite-vec concurrently. Let me search for existing tests and understand the current setup.
