## Thought

All done. Let me summarize what was accomplished.

## Output

All implementations complete. Here's what was done:

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Created Skills Directory with Two Skills

**`skills/check-memories/SKILL.md`**
- Trigger phrases: "how did we solve this before", "what was the decision about X", "have we done this before", "what do you remember about", "check your memory"
- Provides guidance on searching both episodic and thinking memories
- Includes search strategies and result interpretation

**`skills/proactive-recall/SKILL.md`**
- Trigger phrases: choosing implementation approaches, making architectural decisions, selecting libraries, debugging, refactoring
- Core principle: **Search memories BEFORE proposing solutions**
- Includes when to search, search strategy steps, and anti-patterns to avoid

### 2. Updated MCP Tool Descriptions (`src/mcp-server/tools.ts`)

| Tool | Old Description | New Description |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `episodic_create` | "Create a new episodic memory..." | Explains **when to use**: architectural decisions, bug fixes, user preferences |
| `episodic_search` | "Search episodic memories using semantic vector similarity" | "Use **BEFORE making significant decisions** to check for relevant historical context" |
| `thinking_search` | "Search thinking memories using semantic vector similarity" | "Use when facing complex problems to see how similar issues were analyzed before" |

### 3. Updated Plugin Manifest (`plugin.json`)
- Version bumped to 0.1.3
- Description now includes: "Search memories BEFORE making architectural decisions, debugging, or implementing features"
- Added keywords: `decisions`, `history`, `architectural-decisions`, `debugging`, `preferences`, `knowledge-base`

### 4. Build & Tests
- All 288 tests pass
- Plugin scripts rebuilt

### What This Achieves

When Claude Code loads the local-recall plugin, it will:
1. See the skill descriptions in the system prompt
2. **Proactively trigger** the `proactive-recall` skill when making decisions
3. **Trigger** `check-memories` when users ask about past work
4. See improved MCP tool descriptions that emphasize checking memories **before** proposing solutions

**Note**: You'll need to restart Claude Code for the changes to take effect (skill loading happens at plugin initialization).
