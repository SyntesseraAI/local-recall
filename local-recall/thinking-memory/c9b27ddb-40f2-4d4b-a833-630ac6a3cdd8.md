## Thought

The analyzeForMemories function looks like it already handles `message.thinking` properly (from lines 188-196 I saw earlier). Since we're now parsing the raw transcript messages into the normalized `TranscriptMessage` format with thinking extracted, the existing function should work correctly.

Let me mark this as complete and then build/test the changes.

## Output

The `analyzeForMemories` function already correctly handles `message.thinking` - since we're now extracting thinking from content blocks during parsing, it will work correctly.
