## Thought

The user wants to change the processed log from its current format to JSONL (JSON Lines) format. This is a good change as JSONL is:
1. Append-only friendly (just append new lines)
2. Faster to parse (line by line)
3. Cleaner (one record per line)

Let me first find where the processed log is managed to understand the current implementation.

## Output

Let me find the current processed log implementation.
