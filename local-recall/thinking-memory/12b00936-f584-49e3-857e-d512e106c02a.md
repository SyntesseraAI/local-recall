Now I understand the issue:

1. The hook has a 30 second timeout in hooks.json
2. The spawn to Claude CLI has a 30 second internal timeout too
3. When Claude Code's hook runner aborts the process at 30 seconds, it sends an AbortSignal
4. This AbortError isn't being handled

The fix is to:
1. Catch the AbortError on spawn
2. Use a try-catch wrapper
3. Handle the error gracefully

Let me fix the user-prompt-submit.ts file. I need to wrap the spawn in proper error handling for the AbortError case.
