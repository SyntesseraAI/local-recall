Looking at the code, I can see that:

1. `syncTranscripts()` at line 239 calls `cleanupTranscripts()` first (line 241)
2. `cleanupTranscripts()` at line 365 checks for synthetic transcripts using `isSyntheticFile()` and removes them
3. There's also `isSyntheticTranscript()` method at line 326 for checking individual transcripts

So the sync process does clean up synthetic transcripts from the local folder, but the question is whether it's checking BEFORE copying or just cleaning up after. Let me trace through:

1. `syncTranscripts()` first calls `cleanupTranscripts()` - this cleans up existing local transcripts
2. Then it lists source transcripts from Claude's cache
3. Then it copies new/modified ones

So the current flow is:
1. Clean up local folder (removes synthetic files that were already copied)
2. List source transcripts
3. Copy new/modified ones

This means synthetic transcripts CAN still be copied from Claude's cache initially - they're only removed on the next sync when `cleanupTranscripts()` runs. The copying itself doesn't check if the source is synthetic before copying.

So the answer is: No, the sync doesn't check if source transcripts are synthetic before copying them. It cleans up synthetic transcripts from the local folder, but a synthetic file can still be copied and then removed on the next sync cycle.
