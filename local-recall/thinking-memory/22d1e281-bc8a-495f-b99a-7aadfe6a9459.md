## Thought

The user wants to disable episodic memory processing in the MCP daemon. Looking at the server.ts, the daemon runs:
1. `runDaemonProcessing()` - episodic memory extraction
2. `runThinkingDaemonProcessing()` - thinking memory extraction
3. `runVectorSync()` - episodic vector sync
4. `runThinkingVectorSync()` - thinking vector sync

The user wants to remove the episodic memory processing. I should remove the calls to `runDaemonProcessing()` and `runVectorSync()` from the daemon loop.

## Output

I'll remove the episodic memory processing from the MCP daemon. Let me update the server.ts:
