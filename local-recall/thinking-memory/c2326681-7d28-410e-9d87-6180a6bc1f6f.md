The corrupted files have been removed. Now let me check how fastembed determines its cache directory and whether it can re-download properly. Let me look at how the embedding service is being called to see if there's a specific cache path being used.

Actually, let me first look at where fastembed stores its models by default and whether this project overrides that location.
