## Thought

The fix is working. The logs show:
1. The old code (at 14:49:07) was saying "Claude project found but no transcripts folder"
2. The new code (at 14:50:11) correctly says "Found Claude project via path convention" and "Found 230 transcripts in Claude cache"

The fix is complete. Let me summarize what was done.

## Output

The fix is working. The logs confirm:
- **Before (14:49:07)**: "Claude project found but no transcripts folder"
- **After (14:50:11)**: "Found Claude project via path convention" and "Found 230 transcripts"

**Summary of changes to `src/core/transcript-collector.ts`:**

1. **Replaced hash-based naming with path-to-dashes convention** - Claude stores projects using the path with `/` replaced by `-` (e.g., `/Users/joe/Code/project` → `-Users-joe-Code-project`)

2. **Fixed transcript location** - Transcripts are stored directly in the project folder as `.jsonl` files, NOT in a `transcripts` subfolder

The MCP server's background daemon will pick up these changes on the next run (every 5 minutes), or you can restart the session to use the updated code immediately.
