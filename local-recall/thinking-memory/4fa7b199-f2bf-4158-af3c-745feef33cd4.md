## Thought

The user wants me to add a separate daemon call for thinking memory extraction in the MCP server. This will run the thinking extraction in parallel with the episodic memory extraction.

Let me update the server.ts to add this functionality.

## Output

I'll add a separate daemon call for thinking memory extraction to run in parallel with episodic memory extraction.
