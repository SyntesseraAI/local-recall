## Thought

Found it! **Orama has a default similarity threshold of > 0.77 (approximately 0.8)** - and our similarity score of 0.77 is just below that threshold!

When we set `similarity: 0.0`, the search returns the result with score 0.77.

The fix is to set `similarity: 0.0` (or some lower value) in our vector search to not filter out results. We handle our own threshold filtering in the code anyway via `episodicMinSimilarity` and `thinkingMinSimilarity` config options.

Let me update the vector-store.ts to include the similarity parameter.

## Output

**Found the root cause!** Orama has a default similarity threshold of approximately 0.8, and our embeddings have similarity ~0.77 which gets filtered out.

The fix is to set `similarity: 0` to disable Orama's built-in threshold (we handle our own filtering):
