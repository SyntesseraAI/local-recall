## Thought

Now I can see the transcript collector. The issue is that it's filtering only for `.jsonl` files, but it doesn't check if the filename (minus the extension) is a valid UUID. Let me check what UUID format Claude uses.

Looking at the code:
1. `listSourceTranscripts()` at line 164-196 - filters for `.jsonl` files
2. `listLocalTranscripts()` at line 257-284 - also filters for `.jsonl` files
3. `syncTranscripts()` at line 222-252 - copies transcripts

I need to add UUID validation to ensure only proper transcript files (those with UUID filenames) are processed. Let me also check if there's a UUID validation utility already in the codebase.

## Output

I can see the transcript collector filters for `.jsonl` files but doesn't validate that filenames are UUIDs. I need to add UUID validation. Let me check if there's already a UUID validation utility in the codebase.
