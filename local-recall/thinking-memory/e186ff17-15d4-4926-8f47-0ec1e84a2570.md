## Thought

Now I have a comprehensive picture. Let me summarize what's built vs what could be improved or added.

## Output

Here's the current state of **Local Recall**:

## What's Built ✅

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Core memory CRUD** | Complete - `memory.ts` |
| **Index management** | Complete - `index.ts` |
| **Fuzzy search** | Complete - `search.ts` with Fuse.js |
| **MCP Server** | Complete - 6 tools exposed |
| **Session-start hook** | Complete - loads relevant memories |
| **Stop hook** | Complete - auto-extracts memories from transcripts |
| **Keyword extraction** | Complete - using `keyword-extractor` |
| **Text summarization** | Complete - using `ts-textrank` |
| **Plugin packaging** | Complete - in `dev-marketplace/` |
| **Tests** | 172 passing |

## Potential Areas to Build/Improve

1. **CLI Tool** - `bin` points to `dist/cli.js` but no `src/cli.ts` exists
   - Commands: `init`, `search`, `list`, `create`, `config:validate`

2. **Memory Deduplication** - No mechanism to detect/merge similar memories

3. **Memory Decay/Pruning** - No way to archive or remove stale memories

4. **Context-Aware Retrieval** - Session-start could be smarter about what files you're working on

5. **Memory Relationships** - No linking between related memories

6. **Better Stop Hook Analysis** - Current pattern matching is basic regex; could use smarter NLP

7. **Web UI/Dashboard** - Visualize and manage memories

8. **Memory Export/Import** - Bulk operations for sharing

9. **Real-world Testing** - Try the plugin in an actual Claude Code project

What catches your interest? Or would you like to try installing the plugin somewhere to see how it works in practice?
