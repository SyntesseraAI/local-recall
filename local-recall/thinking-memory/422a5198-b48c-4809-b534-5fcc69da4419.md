The user wants to make several changes:

1. Remove `index_rebuild` and `memory_list` tools from MCP
2. Rename the remaining tools to be prefixed with `episodic_` instead of `memory_`
3. Add similar tools for "thinking" memory retrieval
4. Rename the folder "thinking-memories" to "thinking-memory" for consistency

Let me create a todo list and start working on these changes. First, I should look at the current MCP server implementation to understand what needs to be changed.
