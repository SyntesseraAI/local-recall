## Thought

The user wants me to research Claude Plugins and the new Rules system to understand how we can better ensure Claude checks local-recall when making decisions. They're suggesting that Rules, Skills, or a better MCP description might help.

Let me think about what skills might apply here:
- `superpowers:brainstorming` - This could be useful since we're exploring ideas before implementation
- This is a research task, so I should explore the codebase and do web searches

Let me start by researching what Claude Plugins and the Rules system are. I should use web search and also check the claude-code-guide agent for documentation.

## Output

I'll research Claude Plugins and the Rules system to understand how we can better integrate local-recall into Claude's decision-making workflow.
