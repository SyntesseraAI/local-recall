## Thought

Ah, I understand now. The user wants the retrieval to be token-based, not count-based. So instead of "return 10 thinking memories", it should be "return thinking memories until we hit 1000 tokens".

Let me continue updating the extractor to combine the content, then update the retrieval in the hook to use token-based limiting.

## Output

Got it - token-based retrieval instead of count-based. Let me continue with the extractor update, then implement token-based retrieval.
