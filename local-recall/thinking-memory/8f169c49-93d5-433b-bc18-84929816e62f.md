## Thought

The current session-start hook already retrieves the 5 most recent episodic memories sorted by `occurred_at` timestamp. However, looking at the user's comment "The sessionstart should retrieve the most recent memories created to allow sessions to continue with context", I think there might be a few things they could want:

1. Perhaps they want it to also include thinking memories?
2. Perhaps they want more than 5 memories?
3. Perhaps they want the most recently *created* memories rather than the ones with most recent `occurred_at`?

Actually, looking at the code on line 73, it sorts by `occurred_at` timestamp, which is when the original event occurred - not when the memory was created. This might be the issue.

Let me also check if there's a distinction in the memory format between when the memory was created vs when the event occurred. Looking at the types might help.

## Output

The current implementation retrieves the 5 most recent episodic memories sorted by `occurred_at` timestamp (when the original event occurred). It only retrieves episodic memories, not thinking memories.

Let me check the memory types to understand the available fields:
