## Thought

There are lots of references, but the key files I need to update are:
1. `eslint.config.js` - update the ignore path
2. `README.md` - update the install path
3. `.gitignore` - update the scripts path

The memory files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` and `local-recall/thinking-memory/` contain historical references that should probably stay as-is since they document past events.

Let me update the config files that need actual changes.

## Output

I found several files that need updating. Let me update the config files (the memory files contain historical references that should stay as-is).
