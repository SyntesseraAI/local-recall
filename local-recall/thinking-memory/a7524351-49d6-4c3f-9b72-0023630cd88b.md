## Thought

The user is seeing an error in the session start hook - it's failing because the tokenizer file is not found at `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json`. This seems to be related to a vector store/embedding system that requires model files to be downloaded.

Let me investigate what's happening here and find the solution.

## Output

I see the session start hook is failing because the embedding model tokenizer file is missing. Let me investigate the embedding and vector store setup to understand what's needed.
