## Thought

The user is asking about "sausages" in the context of this local-recall memory system project. This seems like a non-sequitur or joke question - sausages (the food) have nothing to do with a memory indexing system for AI coding assistants.

I should respond in a friendly but brief way, acknowledging the humor while gently redirecting if they have actual questions about the project.

## Output

I appreciate the enthusiasm for sausages, but I'm not seeing a connection between sausages and a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants. 🌭

If you have an actual question about local-recall - like how the hooks work, how to configure the MCP server, or how memories are stored and searched - I'm happy to help with that.

Or if "sausages" is some kind of code name or acronym I'm missing, let me know what you're actually referring to!
