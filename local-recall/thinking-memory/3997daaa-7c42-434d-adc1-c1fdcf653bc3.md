## Thought

All 32 tests pass. The memory extractor is now using Haiku. Let me summarize:

1. ✅ Tested memory extraction with Haiku - it works correctly
2. ✅ Updated `callClaudeCLI` to use `--model haiku`
3. ✅ All unit tests pass

The change is complete.

## Output

All 32 tests pass. The memory extractor has been switched to use Haiku.

**Summary:**
- Tested memory extraction with Haiku - it successfully extracted valid memories from a sample transcript
- Updated `src/core/memory-extractor.ts:80-81` to add `--model haiku` to the Claude CLI args
- All unit tests pass

Haiku is significantly cheaper (~20x) and faster than Sonnet for this structured extraction task, making it a good fit for the memory extraction workload.
