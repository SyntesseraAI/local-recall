## Thought

Build successful. The `--strict-mcp-config` flag is now added to the claude command for keyword extraction, which will disable MCP servers during that subprocess call.

## Output

Done. Added `--strict-mcp-config` to the `claude` command for keyword extraction. This prevents MCP servers from loading during that subprocess, adding another layer of protection against recursion.
