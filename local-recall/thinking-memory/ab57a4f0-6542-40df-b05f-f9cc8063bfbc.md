The user wants me to add debug logging when memories are searched in the hooks. I need to look at both hooks:
1. `user-prompt-submit.ts` - for episodic memory search
2. `user-prompt-submit-thinking.ts` - for thinking memory search

I should add logging that shows the subject/title, filename, and similarity score for each memory found.
