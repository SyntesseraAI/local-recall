The user has sent a new message while the tests are running. Let me first check the test output and then address the new request about transcript syncing behavior.

The user wants to:
1. Not copy transcripts if they already exist at the destination
2. If modified date or size has changed, move them and set for reprocessing
3. They're uncertain about how this works with the processed log

This is a more complex feature request. Let me first complete the current task (folder rename), then address this new request.
