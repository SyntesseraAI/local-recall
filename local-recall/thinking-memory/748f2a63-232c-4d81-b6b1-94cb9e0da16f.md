## Thought

The user is asking about sausages and software development. This seems like a humorous or off-topic request that has nothing to do with the local-recall codebase I'm working in. I should respond conversationally but keep it brief since this isn't a software engineering task.

## Output

I appreciate the creative thinking, but sausages are generally better suited for breakfast than building software. Unless you're thinking of:

- **Links** - like sausage links, software modules should be connected but separable
- **Casings** - APIs wrap functionality like casings wrap meat
- **The grind** - both involve processing raw materials into something useful

But honestly, if you have actual software engineering work you'd like help with in this local-recall project, I'm ready. The git status shows you've got changes across docs, core modules, hooks, and utilities. What are you working on?
