The user confirmed that we need a separate processed log for thinking memories. Let me address the questions and then proceed with implementation.

Based on their response, they want:
1. Separate processed log (confirmed)
2. They didn't answer the other questions explicitly, so I should make reasonable defaults and proceed

Let me make reasonable decisions for the unanswered questions:
1. **Subject generation**: I'll derive it automatically from the first ~100 characters of the thinking block, truncated sensibly
2. **applies_to scope**: I'll default to `global` since thinking blocks are general reasoning, not file-specific
3. **Deduplication**: By content hash (of the thinking content) and occurred_at timestamp (same pattern as memories)
4. **MCP tools**: I'll skip for now unless they ask - they only mentioned the hook
5. **Integration**: Keep as separate hooks (they said "new UserPromptSubmit hook")

Now let me proceed with implementation. I'll create a todo list and start working.
