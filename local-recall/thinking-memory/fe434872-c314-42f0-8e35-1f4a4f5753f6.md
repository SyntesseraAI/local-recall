## Thought

Now I understand the current state:

**Current state:**
- `episodic-000001.jsonl` is in `local-recall/` (root), contains only a few entries (9KB)
- `thinking-000001.jsonl` is in `local-recall/` (root), contains ~170KB
- `episodic-memory/` folder has 779 `.md` files (not migrated/deleted)
- `thinking-memory/` folder has 2132 `.md` files (not migrated/deleted)
- Old `thinking.jsonl` was deleted (good)

**User's expectations:**
1. JSONL files should be INSIDE `episodic-memory/` and `thinking-memory/` folders
2. All `.md` files should be read and migrated to JSONL
3. All `.md` files should be deleted after successful migration
4. Embeddings should be generated during Orama loading and stored in JSONL

Let me review the relevant code to understand what changes are needed.

## Output

Now I understand the current state. Let me summarize the gaps:

| Aspect | Current State | Expected |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| JSONL location | `local-recall/*.jsonl` | `local-recall/episodic-memory/*.jsonl` |
| Markdown files | Still exist (779 episodic, 2132 thinking) | Should be deleted |
| Migration | Partial - JSONL has few entries | All markdown migrated to JSONL |
| Embeddings | Stored in Orama index | Also in JSONL files |

Let me review the relevant code to understand what needs to change:
