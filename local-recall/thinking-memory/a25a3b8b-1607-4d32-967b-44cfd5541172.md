## Thought

The user is saying "The gitignore is not being created". Let me understand what they're referring to.

Looking at the CLAUDE.md file, I can see:

```
├── local-recall/                # Memory storage (version-controlled)
│   ├── .gitignore               # Auto-generated, excludes index.json and recall.log
│   ├── index.json               # Keyword index cache (gitignored)
│   ├── recall.log               # Debug log file (gitignored)
│   └── memories/                # Individual memory files (tracked in git)
```

So there should be a `.gitignore` file in the `local-recall/` directory that auto-generates and excludes `index.json` and `recall.log`.

Looking at the git status:
```
D local-recall/.gitignore
 D local-recall/memories/.gitkeep
 M src/core/index.ts
```

It shows that `local-recall/.gitignore` has been deleted (D flag). This might be a clue.

The user has opened `src/core/index.ts`, which is the index management file. This is likely where the `.gitignore` creation logic should be.

Let me read the `src/core/index.ts` file to see what's going on and check if the gitignore creation logic is there or missing.

## Output

I'll investigate the `.gitignore` creation issue. Let me first read the index management file to see the current implementation.
