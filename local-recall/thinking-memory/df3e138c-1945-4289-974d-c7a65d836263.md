I found that:
1. `.claude-plugin/` doesn't exist - the plugin structure mentioned in CLAUDE.md is inaccurate
2. `hooks.json` doesn't exist at the root
3. There are some additional files that aren't mentioned in docs (transcript-condenser.ts, summarize.ts, prompts/memory-extraction.ts)

Let me check more carefully what files exist at the project root.
