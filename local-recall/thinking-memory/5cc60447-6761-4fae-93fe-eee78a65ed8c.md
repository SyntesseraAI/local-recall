## Thought

The files are dated today (Dec 16 22:16), which confirms the build output went to the correct location. The directory timestamps are from old dates but the files inside are freshly built.

Now let me verify the marketplace.json has the correct source path and confirm there's no dev-marketplace folder left.

## Output

The build output is in the correct location. Let me verify the configuration files and that dev-marketplace is gone.
