Good, I have a better picture now. The project has:

1. Core implementation in `src/` with:
   - Core memory management (memory.ts, index.ts, search.ts, types.ts)
   - Hooks (session-start.ts, stop.ts)
   - MCP server (server.ts, tools.ts)
   - Utilities (config.ts, fuzzy.ts, logger.ts, markdown.ts, summarize.ts, transcript.ts)

2. Documentation in `docs/`
3. Tests structure exists but seems minimal
4. Local storage directory exists with a memories folder and a recall.log

The user wants to discuss decisions that need to be made. I should ask them what specific decisions they want to discuss, or what areas they're concerned about. Based on the CLAUDE.md and current state, there are several potential decision areas:

1. How the Stop hook decides what's "memory-worthy"
2. Memory deduplication strategy
3. How scopes work and when to use which
4. Testing strategy and coverage
5. Distribution/plugin packaging
6. Index refresh strategy
7. Fuzzy search tuning

Let me ask the user what they want to discuss rather than assuming.
