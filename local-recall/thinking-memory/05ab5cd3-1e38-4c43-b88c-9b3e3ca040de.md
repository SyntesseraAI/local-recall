## Thought

Let me provide a summary of what was updated.

## Output

Done. Updated documentation:

**CLAUDE.md**
- Fixed architecture tree to show actual `dist/` output instead of fictional `scripts/`
- Added missing src files: `transcript-collector.ts`, `transcript-condenser.ts`, `memory-extractor.ts`, `processed-log.ts`, `prompts/`, `types/`, etc.
- Removed non-existent plugin structure (`.claude-plugin/`, `hooks.json`, `.mcp.json`)
- Updated all path references from `scripts/` to `dist/`

**docs/architecture.md**
- Replaced "Index Manager" with "Transcript Condenser" in diagram
- Removed `index.json` references (system uses `memory.sqlite` vector store)
- Updated data flows to reflect vector-based search
- Fixed storage structure

**docs/hooks.md**
- Fixed hook config to use `.claude/settings.json` format
- Updated UserPromptSubmit to describe vector search (removed incorrect Claude Haiku reference)
- Updated paths to `dist/hooks/`
- Fixed environment variables and common issues

**docs/mcp-server.md**
- Updated server start commands to use `dist/` path
- Simplified storage structure (removed fictional folders)
- Removed HTTP port/host config (server uses stdio)
- Fixed client integration example
