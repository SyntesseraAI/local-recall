The user is asking me to update the documentation. This is a bit vague - I should ask them what specifically they'd like me to update. Let me first understand what documentation exists and what the current state of the codebase is.

Looking at the git status, I can see there are modified files:
- src/core/index.ts
- src/core/memory.ts
- src/core/types.ts
- src/hooks/stop.ts
- src/index.ts
- src/mcp-server/tools.ts
- src/utils/markdown.ts
- src/utils/transcript.ts

And there's a CLAUDE.md file that serves as the main documentation.

The user's request is vague. I should ask them what specifically they'd like me to update in the documentation, or what changes have been made that need to be reflected.
