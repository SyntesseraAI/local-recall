The user is asking if I'm seeing any information about stew in my context - they might be testing whether the local-recall system is injecting memories about stew into my context via the hooks.

Let me think about what's in my context:
1. The CLAUDE.md file with project instructions
2. The session start hook output (just said "Success")
3. The user prompt submit hook output (just said "Success")
4. Our conversation history where we discussed stew

I don't see any injected memories about stew from the hooks - the hook outputs just show "Success" without any memory content being injected. The only stew-related content is from our conversation itself.

I should be honest about what I'm seeing.
