## Thought

The test failures are in two categories:

1. **Validation tests expecting throws** - The new behavior silently skips invalid messages instead of throwing. This is intentional since real transcripts may have messages we don't understand (like system messages), and we want to be lenient.

2. **analyzeForMemories tests** - These tests are using single-line content, but the function only creates memories from multi-line content. This is pre-existing behavior.

Let me look at the test file to understand what's being tested and update the tests appropriately.

## Output

Let me check the test file to understand the failing tests:
