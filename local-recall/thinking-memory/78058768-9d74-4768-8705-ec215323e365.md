## Thought

The user wants me to commit and push the current changes. Let me check the git status to see what needs to be committed.

Looking at the git status from the context:
- Modified: dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
- Modified: package.json
- Modified: src/mcp-server/tools.ts
- Several untracked files in dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/skills/ and local-recall/thinking-memory/

I should follow the git commit protocol:
1. Run git status, git diff, and git log in parallel
2. Analyze changes and draft a commit message
3. Add files and commit
4. Push to remote

Let me start by running the git commands to understand what's being committed.

## Output

I'll check the current state and prepare the commit.
