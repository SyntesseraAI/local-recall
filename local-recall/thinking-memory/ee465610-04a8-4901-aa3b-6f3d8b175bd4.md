The model is now properly downloaded with all required files including `tokenizer.json`. The embedding service should now work correctly.

The issue was that the previous model cache had corrupted/incomplete files. The download must have been interrupted previously, leaving only partial files (config.json and a partial model file). Now it has all the required files:
- config.json
- model_optimized.onnx (full 132MB vs the previous 32MB)
- ort_config.json
- special_tokens_map.json
- tokenizer_config.json
- tokenizer.json
- vocab.txt

The session start hook should now work correctly.
