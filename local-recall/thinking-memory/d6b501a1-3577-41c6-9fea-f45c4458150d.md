## Thought

The user wants to understand this repository. Let me explore the codebase to give them a good overview. I should look at the structure, key files, and understand what's been implemented so far.

Let me start by exploring the directory structure and key files.

## Output

I'll explore the repository to help you understand what's here and what decisions need to be made.
