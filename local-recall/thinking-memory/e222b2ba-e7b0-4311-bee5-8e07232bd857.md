## Thought

This confirms the major change - migrating from SQLite + sqlite-vec to Orama. This is a significant architectural change that:

1. Removes native dependencies (better-sqlite3, sqlite-vec)
2. Uses pure JavaScript/TypeScript search (Orama)
3. Eliminates the need for the daemon architecture (http-server.ts, daemon-client.ts)
4. Removes the database.ts utility
5. Simplifies the hooks since they no longer need to communicate with a daemon

This is a substantial refactoring. The commit message should reflect this major change.

Let me commit these changes. I should separate concerns - the code changes are the main commit, and the memory files could be a separate commit or included together.

Looking at the changes:
1. Core architecture change: SQLite → Orama 
2. Removed files: http-server.ts, daemon-client.ts, database.ts
3. Updated hooks to work directly without daemon
4. New memory files (episodic and thinking)

I'll commit all the code changes first, then decide about the memory files. Actually, looking at the CLAUDE.md, it says memory files ARE version-controlled, so they should be committed too.

Let me create a commit that captures the major change.

## Output

Now I understand the changes. This is a significant refactoring that:

1. **Replaces SQLite + sqlite-vec with Orama** - Moving from native SQLite with vector extension to a pure JavaScript search engine
2. **Removes daemon architecture** - Deleted http-server.ts, daemon-client.ts, and database.ts since hooks no longer need to communicate with a daemon
3. **Simplifies hooks** - They now work directly without HTTP communication to a daemon
4. **Adds new memories** - 11 episodic and ~70 thinking memory files

Let me create the commit:
