## Thought

The user is asking if the hooks are working. This is a direct question about the local-recall system's hooks functionality. Let me check what hooks are configured and test if they're working properly.

From the context, I can see:
1. There's a SessionStart hook that should have run when this session started
2. There's a UserPromptSubmit hook that should run when the user submits a prompt
3. There's a Stop hook that runs when Claude stops processing

I can see in the system reminder that there was a callback hook success message:
"SessionStart:Callback hook success: Success"

This suggests the SessionStart hook did execute successfully. However, I should verify:
1. If the hooks are properly configured
2. If the built scripts exist
3. If the hooks are actually working as expected

Let me check the hooks configuration and the built scripts.

## Output

I can see that the SessionStart hook executed successfully based on the system message at the beginning of this session. Let me verify the hooks are properly set up and check their status:
