The user is reporting an issue with the user prompt submit hook but hasn't provided the actual error message. They said "I get this error:" but the message seems to be cut off. Let me ask them to provide the error details.

Wait, actually looking at the git status, I can see there are modified files including `src/hooks/user-prompt-submit.ts`.
