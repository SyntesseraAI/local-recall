## Thought

The model is now properly downloaded with all required files including `tokenizer.json`. The embedding service should now work correctly.

The issue was that the previous model cache had corrupted/incomplete files. The download must have been interrupted previously, leaving only partial files (config.json and a partial model file). Now it has all the required files:
- config.json
- model_optimized.onnx (full 132MB vs the previous 32MB)
- ort_config.json
- special_tokens_map.json
- tokenizer_config.json
- tokenizer.json
- vocab.txt

The session start hook should now work correctly.

## Output

The model is now properly downloaded with all required files including `tokenizer.json` (the full model is 132MB vs the corrupted 32MB partial download).

The issue was that the previous model cache was corrupted/incomplete - likely from an interrupted download. After removing the corrupted files, fastembed re-downloaded the complete model.

Your session start hook should now work. The embedding model files are stored in `local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/` and are ready for use.
