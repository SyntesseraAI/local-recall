## Thought

The user is confirming that the mutex errors are gone now that they updated the plugin. This makes sense - the old plugin version was still using the sqlite-vec based code, and once they updated to the version with Orama, the mutex issues went away since Orama is pure JavaScript with no native dependencies.

I should acknowledge this briefly.

## Output

Got it. The old plugin was still running the sqlite-vec code. With Orama being pure JavaScript, no more mutex issues.
