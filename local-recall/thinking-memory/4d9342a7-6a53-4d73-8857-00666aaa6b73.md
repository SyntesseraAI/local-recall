## Thought

Build succeeded. Let me clear the todo list since everything is complete.

## Output

Done! The processed log has been refactored to JSONL format:

**Changes made:**
1. `src/core/processed-log.ts` - Rewrote to use JSONL with append-only operations:
   - Each entry is a JSON line with `action: "add"` or `action: "remove"`
   - `recordProcessed()` appends an "add" line
   - `removeEntry()` appends a "remove" line
   - On load, replays all entries to build current state
   - Added `compact()` method to clean up the file when needed

2. `tests/unit/core/processed-log.test.ts` - Updated tests for JSONL format with new test cases for replay logic and compaction

3. `src/core/index.ts` and `src/core/memory.ts` - Updated auto-generated `.gitignore` to use `processed-log.jsonl`

4. `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` - Bumped concurrency to 20 (from earlier)
