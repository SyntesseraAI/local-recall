## Thought

The user is asking about mutex errors that they're still seeing even after migrating from SQLite/sqlite-vec to Orama for vector search. Let me look at the recent commit and understand what's happening.

Looking at the git status, I can see the recent commit "refactor: Replace SQLite/sqlite-vec with Orama for vector search" was made. But the user is still seeing mutex errors.

Let me search for any remaining SQLite usage or mutex-related code in the codebase.

## Output

Good question. Let me investigate where mutex errors could still be coming from after the Orama migration.
