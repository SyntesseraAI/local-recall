## Thought

I see the flow now. The search engine calls `vectorStore.search()`, but I don't see where the initial sync happens to populate the vector store. Let me trace this:1. `SearchEngine.search()` calls `getVectorStore()` then `vectorStore.search()`
2. `VectorStore.search()` calls `initialize()` if not already done3. But where does the data get added to the SQLite?Looking at `vector-store.ts`:
- `initialize()` just creates the tables, doesn't load data
- `add()` adds individual memories
- `sync()` syncs with file-based memories

Let me check where `sync()` is called, and also check if there's something in the MCP server or memory manager that triggers sync. Let me also check the memory-extractor.ts and the MCP server to understand the full data flow:

## Output

Let me check where the vector store sync happens - it's not clear from the search flow alone:
