## Thought

Now I should write some basic unit tests to verify the JSONL stores work, then move on to modifying the MemoryManager to use the new stores. But first, let me check if there are existing test patterns I should follow.

Let me update the todos and continue with the next steps. I think it's important to write at least some basic tests before modifying the existing classes.

## Output

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
The JSONL stores use a **generic pattern** with type parameters (`JsonlStore<TEntry, TMemory>`). This approach:
- Avoids code duplication between episodic and thinking stores
- Makes the entry parsing/validation configurable via options
- Allows different memory types to share the same append-only log logic
