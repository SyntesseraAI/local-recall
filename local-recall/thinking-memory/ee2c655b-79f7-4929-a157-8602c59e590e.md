Yes! I can see 9 memories that appear to be related to a previous conversation about the Stop hook not firing in the VS Code extension environment. These memories were all created around the same time (2025-11-29T23:53:xx).

The memories are about:
1. The Stop hook never firing
2. Issues with memory creation
3. Transcript parsing
4. Hook configuration
5. VS Code extension environment issues

So yes, I am seeing memories! The system is working, and I can access the memories from the previous session. The user is likely asking this to verify that the memory system is functioning properly.
