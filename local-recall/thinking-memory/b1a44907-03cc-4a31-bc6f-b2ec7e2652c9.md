The user is asking why memories are not being created in the VS Code extension. This is about the Local Recall project, which creates memories through hooks. Let me think about what could be causing this issue.

Looking at the architecture in CLAUDE.md:
1. Memories are created by the Stop hook (`src/hooks/stop.ts`)
2. The Stop hook is triggered when Claude stops processing
3. It reads the transcript file, identifies new messages, and creates memories

The VS Code extension for Claude Code might have different behavior than the CLI. Let me check:
1. How hooks are configured
2. Whether the Stop hook is being triggered in VS Code
3. What the stop hook does

I should look at the current code to understand how the stop hook works and why it might not be creating memories in VS Code.

Let me read the relevant files to understand the issue.
