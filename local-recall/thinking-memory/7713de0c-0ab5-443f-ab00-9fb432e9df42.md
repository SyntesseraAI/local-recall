## Thought

The user wants to test the hooks for the local-recall project. Looking at the project structure, there are hooks in `src/hooks/` - specifically `session-start.ts` and `stop.ts`. 

To test these hooks, I should:
1. First understand what the hooks do and how they're structured
2. Build the project if needed
3. Run the hooks with appropriate test input

Let me start by reading the hook files to understand their structure and how to test them.

## Output

Let me first look at the hook files to understand how they work and then we can test them.
