## Thought

The user is saying the MCP server is failing to start. Let me first check the logs and try to understand what's happening. I should:

1. Check if there are any error logs
2. Try to start the MCP server and see the error
3. Look at the server code to understand what might be failing

Let me start by checking the recall.log file and trying to run the server to see the error.

## Output

Let me investigate the MCP server startup issue. I'll check the logs and try to start the server to see the error.
