## Thought

The user wants to simplify the memory system by removing all the trigger pattern detection and just saving all messages. This is a significant change to the transcript parsing logic.

Let me understand what needs to change:
1. Remove the user-triggered patterns (like "remember this", "save this for later", etc.)
2. Remove the auto-detection heuristics (architecture, bugfix, explanation, discovery, convention)
3. Just save all messages from the transcript

I should look at the relevant files to understand the current implementation:
- `src/utils/transcript.ts` - transcript parsing
- `src/hooks/stop.ts` - the stop hook that creates memories

Let me read these files to understand the current implementation.

## Output

Let me look at the current implementation to understand what needs to change:
