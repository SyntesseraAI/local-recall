- Updated Stop Flow to reflect all messages are processed with deduplication

**docs/hooks.md**:
- Updated Stop Hook flow to show all messages are converted to memories
- Added section explaining no filtering or summarization policy
- Removed "Memory Detection Heuristics" section (no longer applicable)
- Updated transcript format example with correct `type` field

**docs/mcp-server.md**:
- Removed `memory_update` and `memory_delete` tools (not implemented)
- Added `memory_get` tool with correct response schema
- Updated `memory_list` response with `occurred_at` field
- Updated `memory_search` response with `matchedKeywords` field

**docs/memory-format.md**:
- Replaced `updated_at` field with `occurred_at` and `content_hash`
- Added "Content Format" section explaining role prefix (`**user**:`/`**assistant**:`)
- Added "No Filtering or Summarization" section

- Updated all examples with new field format
