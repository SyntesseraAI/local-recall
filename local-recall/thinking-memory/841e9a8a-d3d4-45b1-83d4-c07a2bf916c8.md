Good, I can see the project structure now. It has:
- Source files in src/
- Built output in dist/
- Tests in tests/
- Local-recall storage folder
- Documentation in docs/

The project seems to have a lot of the core implementation done. Let me check what's in the tests folder, and what decisions might be pending. Let me also check what tests exist and what docs exist to understand the current state better.
