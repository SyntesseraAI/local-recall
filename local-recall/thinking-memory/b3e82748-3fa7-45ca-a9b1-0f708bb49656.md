## Thought

Interesting findings:
1. The bundled hook scripts DO exist in `local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/`
2. The recall.log is 2.4GB! That's a problem.
3. I notice in the log that the SessionStart hook shows `stdout:""` - meaning the hook is running but producing no output
4. There's an error about Ollama embed failing with an EOF error

Let me dig deeper - I need to look for hook-related errors specifically, and understand why the hooks might be producing no output. Let me search for more specific patterns.

## Output

I found some critical issues. Let me search for more specific hook-related errors:
