## Thought

The user wants to have a discussion about decisions that need to be made for the local-recall project. Let me first get a better understanding of the current state of the project to have an informed conversation.

Looking at the CLAUDE.md, this is a memory system for AI coding assistants. The architecture is laid out, but I should check what actually exists in the codebase versus what's planned.

Let me explore what's currently implemented to understand what decisions might be pending.

## Output

Sure! Let me take a quick look at the current state of the project to understand what's implemented versus planned, so we can have a productive discussion.
