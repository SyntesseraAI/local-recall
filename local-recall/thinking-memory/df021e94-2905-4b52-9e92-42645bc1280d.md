## Thought

Interesting! Looking at the log:

1. SessionStart hook fired and found 5 recent memories
2. UserPromptSubmit hook fired but... "Skipping internal prompt"

The prompt contained "[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]" check. This is because the prompt that was submitted seems to be an internal one. Let me check what's happening with the current session.

The user asked "ok, let's test orama" but the hook is skipping it because it detected it as an internal prompt. But wait, looking at the code:

```javascript
// Skip internal prompts to avoid recursion (memory extraction prompts, etc.)
if (input.prompt.includes("[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]")) {
```

So it's only supposed to skip prompts that include "[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]". The user's prompt "ok, let's test orama" doesn't contain that. 

Wait - looking more closely at the log timestamp, the hook ran at `11:52:54.845Z` and the log says "Skipping internal prompt". But the user's message "ok, let's test orama" shouldn't trigger that skip.

Hmm, maybe there's something else going on. Let me look at what input the hook received. Or maybe the prompt object contains system stuff too?

Actually, looking at the timestamp again:
- SessionStart: 11:52:54.124Z
- UserPromptSubmit: 11:52:54.845Z 

This is at the START of the session. So the UserPromptSubmit at that time wasn't the user's "ok, let's test orama" message - it was something else that happened during startup.

Let me search for more recent log entries to see what happened when the actual user prompt was submitted.

## Output

I see the issue! The UserPromptSubmit hook ran at session start (11:52:54) and skipped an "internal prompt". Let me see if there are more recent entries after my actual prompt:
