## Thought

I've already explored both codebases in detail. Now I need to understand the specific changes required. Let me read a few more critical files to understand:

1. The current build script in package.json to understand how bundling works
2. The existing plugin.json and marketplace.json structures
3. How the hooks are configured

Then I'll create a plan for the restructuring.

## Output

I've already explored both codebases. Let me read a few critical files to finalize my understanding, then create a plan.
