The build succeeded. The thinking memory extraction is now running in parallel with episodic memory extraction in the daemon.

Let me summarize what I've added:

1. Imported `runThinkingExtraction` from `thinking-extractor.js`
2. Imported `getThinkingVectorStore` from `thinking-vector-store.js`
3. Imported `ThinkingMemoryManager` from `thinking-memory.js`
4. Added `isThinkingProcessing` and `isThinkingSyncing` flags
5. Added `runThinkingDaemonProcessing()` function that runs `runThinkingExtraction()`
6. Added `runThinkingVectorSync()` function that syncs thinking memories to vector store
7. Updated `startDaemonLoop()` to run both episodic and thinking extraction/sync in parallel using `Promise.all()`

Both extractors now run in parallel every 5 minutes, and both vector stores sync in parallel every 10 minutes.
