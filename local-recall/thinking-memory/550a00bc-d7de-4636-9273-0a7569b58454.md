## Thought

The edit was successful. Now synthetic transcripts will be checked before copying, not just cleaned up afterward. The flow is now:

1. Clean up existing synthetic files from local folder
2. List source transcripts from Claude's cache
3. For each transcript to copy, check if it's synthetic first - if so, skip it
4. Copy non-synthetic transcripts

This is more efficient since we avoid copying files we'll just delete later.

## Output

Done. Now `syncTranscripts()` checks if the source transcript is synthetic **before** copying it:

1. `cleanupTranscripts()` still runs first (removes any synthetic files that slipped through previously)
2. For each new/modified transcript, checks `isSyntheticFile(transcript.sourcePath)` before copying
3. Skips with a debug log if synthetic

This avoids unnecessary I/O from copying files that would just be deleted on the next cleanup.
