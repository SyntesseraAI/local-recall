Now I see the architecture. The best approach is to add a helper function to detect synthetic transcripts and filter them out during processing. There are a few options:

1. Add `isSyntheticTranscript()` helper to `transcript-schema.ts` or `transcript-collector.ts`
2. Filter in `parseTranscriptForThinking()` in `thinking-extractor.ts`
3. Filter in `processTranscript()` in `thinking-extractor.ts`

I'll add the filter in both:
1. `transcript-collector.ts` - add a helper method `isSyntheticTranscript()` 
2. `thinking-extractor.ts` - use the helper to skip synthetic files early

Actually, the cleanest approach is to:
1. Add a utility function to check if a transcript is synthetic
2. Use it in both the thinking-extractor and potentially the memory-extractor

Let me also check if there's a memory-extractor that also needs this filter.
