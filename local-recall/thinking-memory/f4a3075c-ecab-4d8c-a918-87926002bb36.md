## Thought

The user is asking about adding "insights" from Claude Code's explanatory mode to the thinking memories. Let me understand what they're asking:

1. Claude Code has an "explanatory mode" that presents "insights" to users
2. These insights should be captured along with thoughts in the thinking/episodic memory system

I need to understand:
1. What are these "insights" in Claude Code's explanatory mode?
2. How does the current thinking memory extraction work?
3. Where would we need to modify the code to capture insights?

Let me first check if there are any skills that apply here. Looking at the available skills:
- `superpowers:brainstorming` - for refining ideas before implementation
- `superpowers:systematic-debugging` - for bugs
- `superpowers:test-driven-development` - for implementing features

This seems like a feature implementation task. The brainstorming skill says to use it "before writing code or implementation plans - refines rough ideas into fully-formed designs through collaborative questioning".

However, before I can brainstorm or plan, I need to understand:
1. What "insights" in explanatory mode actually are
2. How the current transcript format captures them
3. How the thinking extractor currently works

Let me first explore the codebase to understand the current implementation, then we can discuss the design.

## Output

I need to understand the current thinking memory extraction and what "insights" look like in explanatory mode transcripts. Let me explore the codebase first.
