## Thought

Let me analyze this transcript to extract valuable memories about the MCP server startup issue and what was discovered.

Key findings from the transcript:
1. The MCP server is failing to start
2. The MCP SDK was upgraded from ^1.0.0 to 1.23.0, which is a significant version jump
3. There were breaking changes in the SDK between versions (v1.0.0 to v1.23.0)
4. The project has a plugin setup (`local-recall@syntesseraai-local-recall`)
5. The user tried to investigate using web search and checking logs
6. The settings show the local-recall plugin is enabled as a marketplace plugin
7. There's a manifest.json in local-recall-plugin/
8. The transcript shows the investigation process but doesn't show the actual fix yet

What was learned:
- MCP SDK has breaking changes between v1.0.0 and v1.23.0
- The usage pattern changed (likely Server/StdioServerTransport related)
- The project is set up as a marketplace plugin with manifest.json
- There are plugin-specific MCP server scripts

What should be remembered:
1. The MCP SDK version compatibility issue and that v1.23.0 has breaking changes
2. The Server/StdioServerTransport import pattern changed
3. The plugin structure with manifest.json for marketplace distribution
4. The need to check both dist/mcp-server and plugin-specific scripts

Let me format this as memories that would be helpful for future sessions:

Memories to extract:
1. MCP SDK breaking changes between v1.0.0 and v1.23.0 - this is important context for debugging
2. The Server/StdioServerTransport usage pattern change - architectural
3. The plugin is deployed as a marketplace plugin, not just a standalone tool
4. The local-recall plugin has a manifest.json defining it as a marketplace plugin

Actually, looking more carefully at the transcript, the assistant is in the middle of investigating but the transcript ends before the solution is found. 

I'll focus on the investigative insights, noting the unresolved nature of the server startup problem. The key takeaway is the complexity introduced by the SDK version upgrade, which requires careful examination of import patterns and plugin configuration. Debugging will likely involve tracing the changes in Server/StdioServerTransport and verifying compatibility between the new SDK version and the existing plugin structure.

This means MCP server scripts may be located in plugin-specific directories (`local-recall-plugin/scripts/mcp-server/`) rather than just in the main dist/ folder. Both locations should be checked when debugging MCP server issues."
