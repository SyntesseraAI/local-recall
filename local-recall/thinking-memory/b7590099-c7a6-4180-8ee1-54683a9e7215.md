## Thought

The user wants me to:
1. Run a test to see if the memory extractor can work with Haiku model
2. If it works, switch the memory extractor to use Haiku

Let me first find the memory extractor code to understand what model it's currently using and how to test it.

## Output

I'll first look at the memory extractor to understand the current implementation, then test it with Haiku.
