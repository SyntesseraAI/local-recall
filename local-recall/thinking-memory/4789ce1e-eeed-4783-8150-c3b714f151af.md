## Thought

The lock code is in the bundle (11 matches found). Now let me run the tests to make sure everything works.

## Output

Done. The file lock is now in place:

- Lock file: `/tmp/local-recall-embedding.lock`
- Retries: 10 with exponential backoff (100ms - 2s)
- Stale timeout: 30 seconds
- Locks both initialization and embedding operations

Try triggering a few prompts in quick succession to test it. The logs should show "Acquired embedding lock" / "Released embedding lock" messages.
