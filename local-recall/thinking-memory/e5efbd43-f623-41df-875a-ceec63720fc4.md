## Thought

The user is asking about adding logging to the transcript collector to help debug when transcripts aren't being copied over in a new repo. Let me look at the transcript collector code to understand how it works and where we can add logging.

## Output

Let me look at the transcript collector to understand the current flow and add appropriate logging.
