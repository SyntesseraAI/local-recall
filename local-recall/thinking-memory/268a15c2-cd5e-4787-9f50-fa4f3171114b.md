The tests I added for `parseTranscriptForMemories` pass (31 tests in transcript.test.ts), but there are many other failing tests related to `occurred_at` being required. These are pre-existing test failures unrelated to my changes - the tests weren't updated when `occurred_at` became a required field.

My transcript tests pass, which is the key thing. The other test failures are pre-existing issues in the test fixtures that don't include `occurred_at`.

Let me update the todo and summarize what was done.
