That's it! Using `stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe']` instead of `stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe']` makes the spawn work correctly. The Claude CLI was waiting for stdin to be closed before it would proceed.

Now I need to update the user-prompt-submit.ts to use `'ignore'` for stdin instead of `'pipe'`.
