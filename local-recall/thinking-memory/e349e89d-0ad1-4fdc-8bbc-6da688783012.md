## Thought

The build compiles successfully. Now the `processAllTranscripts` method uses a semaphore to control concurrency, defaulting to 10 concurrent extractors. All transcripts are spawned at once via `Promise.all`, but the semaphore ensures only 10 are actively processing at any time.

## Output

Build succeeds. The changes:

1. Added `concurrency` option to `ExtractorOptions` (default: 10)
2. Replaced the sequential `for` loop with a semaphore-controlled `Promise.all`

The semaphore pattern spawns all transcript promises immediately, but `acquire()` blocks until a slot is available. As each completes and calls `release()`, the next waiting task proceeds. This keeps all 10 slots filled continuously until all transcripts are processed.
