Now let me update the configuration section - `indexRefreshInterval` is probably no longer relevant with the SQLite approach. Let me also check if the `fuzzyThreshold` is still used. Looking at the vector-store.ts code, it doesn't seem to use either of these. I should update or remove them.

Also need to update the Notes for AI Assistants section about index.json.
