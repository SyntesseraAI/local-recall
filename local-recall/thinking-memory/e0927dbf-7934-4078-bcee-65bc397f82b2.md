## Thought

Hmm, the MCP server isn't using the updated code - it's still returning results without content. The MCP server running now was started before my changes. I need to restart it or it's using the old code.

Actually wait - the MCP server is running as a plugin within Claude Code. It's loaded the old version. The changes I made are in the source files but the MCP server is running the old compiled version.

However, looking at the hook injection I received earlier, it DID include content. So the hooks are working correctly. The MCP tools may need the server to be restarted to pick up the new code.

But also - wait, I see the issue. The build completed with the new scripts, so the bundled version in dev-marketplace should have the new code. But the MCP server running in this session is using the old code.

Let me update the todo list to reflect what's done.

## Output

The MCP server is still running the old code - it needs a restart to pick up the changes. But the hooks will work correctly after the rebuild.
