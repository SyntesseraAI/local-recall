## Thought

The build succeeded. Let me summarize what I added for the user.

## Output

Done. I've added comprehensive INFO-level logging to the transcript collector. Now when it runs, you'll see detailed output in `local-recall/recall.log` showing:

**Search process:**
```
[timestamp] [INFO] [transcript] Searching for Claude project transcripts...
[timestamp] [INFO] [transcript]   Project path: /path/to/your/project
[timestamp] [INFO] [transcript]   Claude projects dir: ~/.claude/projects
[timestamp] [INFO] [transcript]   Expected folder: -path-to-your-project
[timestamp] [INFO] [transcript]   Found 5 transcript file(s) at expected path
```

**Or if not found:**
```
[timestamp] [INFO] [transcript]   Expected folder not found - trying fallback search...
[timestamp] [INFO] [transcript]   Scanning 12 Claude project folders for matching cwd...
[timestamp] [INFO] [transcript] No matching Claude project directory found for: /path/to/project
[timestamp] [INFO] [transcript]   This is normal if you haven't run Claude Code in this repo yet.
```

**Sync summary:**
```
[timestamp] [INFO] [transcript] Starting transcript sync...
[timestamp] [INFO] [transcript] Found 8 transcript(s) in Claude cache
[timestamp] [INFO] [transcript] Transcript sync complete:
[timestamp] [INFO] [transcript]   Copied: 3
[timestamp] [INFO] [transcript]   Skipped (up-to-date): 2
[timestamp] [INFO] [transcript]   Skipped (synthetic): 1
[timestamp] [INFO] [transcript]   Skipped (no thinking blocks): 2
```

Check `local-recall/recall.log` in your new repo after the MCP server runs its daemon (every 5 minutes) to see what's happening.
