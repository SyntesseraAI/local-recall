## Thought

The user wants me to update the documentation and README for a new user. This is a significant task that involves:

1. Reviewing the current documentation (CLAUDE.md)
2. Checking git history for recent changes
3. Using my memories to understand what's changed
4. Creating/updating documentation that's clear for new users

Let me think about skills that might apply here:
- `superpowers:brainstorming` - Could be useful for refining the documentation approach
- `superpowers:writing-plans` - Could help plan the documentation updates

This is a documentation task, not a coding task per se. I should:
1. First explore the current state of documentation
2. Check git history for recent changes
3. Review memories for context
4. Plan what updates are needed
5. Make the updates

Let me start by reading the current documentation and checking git history to understand what needs to be updated.

## Output

I'll work through the documentation systematically. Let me start by exploring the current state of the codebase, git history, and relevant memories.
