The user has shared a plan for migrating from keyword-based search to a vector database using SQLite and FastEmbed. They want me to review and potentially implement this plan.

Let me first understand what's being proposed:
1. Replace keyword-based search with vector embeddings
2. Use `fastembed` for generating embeddings
3. Use `better-sqlite3` with `sqlite-vec` extension for vector storage
4. Sync the vector database with the file-based memory system
5. Update the search to use vector similarity instead of fuzzy keyword matching

This is a significant architectural change. Before implementing, I should:
1. Understand the current codebase structure
2. Check what dependencies are already in use
3. Understand the current search implementation

Let me explore the codebase to understand the current state better.
