## Thought

The user wants to re-enable episodic memories in the defaults. Looking at the CLAUDE.md, I can see the configuration options table shows:

| `episodicEnabled` | `LOCAL_RECALL_EPISODIC_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable episodic memory retrieval |

So currently it's defaulting to `false`. The user wants to change this to `true`.

I need to find where this default is set in the code. It's likely in `src/utils/config.ts` based on the architecture description.

## Output

I'll find where the default is set and update it.
