## Thought

So the actual structure is different from what's documented:- The `scripts/` folder mentioned in docs doesn't exist. Instead, the build output goes to `dist/`- There's no `.claude-plugin/` folder- There's no `hooks.json` or `.mcp.json` at the root

Based on my analysis, the documentation has several inaccuracies. Let me provide a summary.

## Output

Based on my analysis, **the documentation has several inconsistencies with the actual codebase**. Here's what I found:

## Issues in Documentation

### CLAUDE.md Issues

| Section | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| **Architecture tree** | Shows `scripts/` folder but actual build goes to `dist/` |
| **Plugin structure** | References `.claude-plugin/`, `hooks.json`, `.mcp.json` - none exist |
| **src/utils/** | Missing `summarize.ts`, `gitignore.ts`, `config.ts` |
| **src/core/** | Missing `transcript-condenser.ts` |
| **src/prompts/** | Folder not documented at all |
| **src/types/** | Missing `transcript-schema.ts`, `rake-pos.d.ts` |

### docs/architecture.md Issues
- References `index.json` (keyword index) but actual implementation uses `memory.sqlite` vector store
- Shows `index.json` in storage layer but this appears deprecated in favor of vector store
- Index Manager section may be outdated - unclear if still used

### docs/hooks.md Issues
- References `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` but CLAUDE.md uses `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
- Shows paths to `dist/hooks/` but CLAUDE.md says `scripts/hooks/`
- UserPromptSubmit says it uses "Claude Haiku" for keyword extraction - needs verification

### docs/mcp-server.md Issues
- Shows `transcripts/` folder in local-recall storage structure that may not exist
- References `processed-log.json` but actual file might be in different location

### General
- The `scripts/` bundled output directory referenced in CLAUDE.md doesn't exist - build goes to `dist/`
- No plugin metadata files (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `hooks.json`, `.mcp.json`) exist at root

**The documentation is out of sync with the actual implementation.** Would you like me to update it to match the current codebase structure?
