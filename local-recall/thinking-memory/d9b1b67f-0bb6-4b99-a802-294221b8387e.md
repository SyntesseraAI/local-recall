## Thought

Done. The session-start hook now retrieves both episodic and thinking memories on session start, sorted by `occurred_at` (most recent first). This will provide better context for continuing sessions.

## Output

Done. The session-start hook (`src/hooks/session-start.ts`) now retrieves both memory types:

**Changes made:**
- Loads the 5 most recent **episodic memories** (if `episodicEnabled`)
- Loads the 5 most recent **thinking memories** (if `thinkingEnabled`)
- Both sorted by `occurred_at` timestamp (most recent first)
- Outputs separate sections for each type
- Respects the existing configuration flags

On session start, Claude will now see both recent factual context and recent reasoning patterns, allowing sessions to continue with fuller context.
