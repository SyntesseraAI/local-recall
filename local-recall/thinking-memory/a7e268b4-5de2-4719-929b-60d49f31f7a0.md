## Thought

Now I have a clear picture:

**MCP Server Status:**
- **Running**: Yes (PID 4524)
- **Path**: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/mcp-server/server.js`
- **Configuration**: Located at `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.mcp.json`

**What's happening:**
- The MCP server is configured and running from a plugin subdirectory (`dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/`)
- The main project root (`/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/`) doesn't have the built `scripts/` directory yet
- This appears to be a development setup where there's a separate plugin directory for testing

I should summarize this clearly for the user.

## Output

Here's the status:

**MCP Server: Running ✓**

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Process | Running (PID 4524) |
| Location | `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/mcp-server/server.js` |
| Config | `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.mcp.json` |

**Note:** The server is running from a plugin subdirectory (`dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/`), not from the main project root. The main project root doesn't have a `scripts/` directory yet - it looks like `npm run build` hasn't been run there.

The configuration points `LOCAL_RECALL_DIR` to `./local-recall`, so memories would be stored relative to wherever Claude Code is running from.

Would you like me to:
1. Build the main project so it has its own `scripts/` directory?
2. Check if the MCP tools are working correctly?
3. Something else?
