## Thought

Good. The logger writes to `local-recall/recall.log`. By default (non-production), debug level is enabled. The user should be able to see the debug logs in `recall.log`.

Now let me add more informative INFO-level logging to the transcript collector to help diagnose what's happening when transcripts aren't being copied. The key places are:

1. `findClaudeProjectDir()` - log what we're searching for and whether we found it
2. `syncTranscripts()` - log how many source transcripts were found

Let me update the file with more verbose logging at the INFO level so it's always visible, and provides clear diagnostic information.

## Output

Now I'll add more informative INFO-level logging to the transcript collector. The key places to log are:

1. When starting the search (what path we're looking for)
2. Whether the Claude projects directory exists
3. How many transcripts were found (or not found)
4. The sync summary
