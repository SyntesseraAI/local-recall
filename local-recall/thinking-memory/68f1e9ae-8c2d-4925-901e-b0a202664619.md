## Thought

The user is reporting two issues:
1. The SessionStart hook is failing with an AbortError - this looks like a timeout issue where the hook is taking too long and getting aborted
2. The gitignore doesn't have `memory.sqlite` added to it

Let me investigate both issues. First, let me look at the session-start hook to understand what's happening, and then check the gitignore file.

## Output

Let me investigate both issues.
