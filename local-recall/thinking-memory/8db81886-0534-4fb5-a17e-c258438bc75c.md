## Thought

The user confirmed that we need a separate processed log for thinking memories. Let me address the questions and then proceed with implementation.

Based on their response, they want:
1. Separate processed log (confirmed)
2. They didn't answer the other questions explicitly, so I should make reasonable defaults and proceed

Let me make reasonable decisions for the unanswered questions:
1. **Subject generation**: I'll derive it automatically from the first ~100 characters of the thinking block, truncated sensibly
2. **applies_to scope**: I'll default to `global` since thinking blocks are general reasoning, not file-specific
3. **Deduplication**: By content hash (of the thinking content) and occurred_at timestamp (same pattern as memories)
4. **MCP tools**: I'll skip for now unless they ask - they only mentioned the hook
5. **Integration**: Keep as separate hooks (they said "new UserPromptSubmit hook")

Now let me proceed with implementation. I'll create a todo list and start working.

## Output

Good point - separate processed log is essential to avoid conflicts. Let me proceed with implementation using sensible defaults for the other questions:

- **Subject**: Auto-derive from first ~100 chars of thinking content
- **applies_to**: Default to `global` (thinking is general reasoning)
- **Deduplication**: By content_hash + occurred_at (same pattern)
- **MCP tools**: Skip for now (just hook injection)
- **Hooks**: Separate hook file
