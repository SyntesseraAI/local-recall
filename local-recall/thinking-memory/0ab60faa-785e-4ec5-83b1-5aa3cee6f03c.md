## Thought

The user is asking about a different scenario - what if each Claude Code instance is in a completely separate project folder/codebase? Let me think through this:

1. Each project has its own `local-recall/` folder
2. Each project has its own `orama-episodic-index.json` and `orama-thinking-index.json`
3. Each project has its own `processed-log.jsonl`
4. Each MCP server is configured with `LOCAL_RECALL_DIR` pointing to that project's folder

In this case, the instances are completely isolated! They don't share any files. The only shared resources would be:
1. Ollama (external service) - but this handles concurrency fine
2. The Claude transcript cache at `~/.claude/projects/` - but each project gets its own subfolder

So actually, if you're running Claude in different codebases, there's no cross-communication issue at all. Each instance is fully isolated.

The problem I described earlier only applies when multiple Claude instances are open in the SAME project/folder.

## Output

**If each instance is in a separate folder/codebase → No problem!**

Each project gets its own isolated storage:

```
~/project-a/
└── local-recall/
    ├── episodic-memory/
    ├── thinking-memory/
    ├── orama-episodic-index.json    ← Only project-a writes here
    └── orama-thinking-index.json

~/project-b/
└── local-recall/
    ├── episodic-memory/
    ├── thinking-memory/
    ├── orama-episodic-index.json    ← Only project-b writes here
    └── orama-thinking-index.json
```

**Shared resources that still work fine:**
- **Ollama** - External service, handles concurrent requests properly
- **`~/.claude/projects/`** - Claude's transcript cache, each project gets its own subfolder

**The conflict only happens when:**
- Multiple Claude windows open in the **same** project folder
- Multiple daemons trying to write to the **same** index files

So if you typically work in one Claude window per project, the current architecture is fine. The issue is only when you have 2+ windows in the same repo simultaneously.
