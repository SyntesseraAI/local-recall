## Thought

The INFO-level logging IS there (lines 76-78, 100, 107, etc.). But the recall.log shows DEBUG-level logs instead. That's odd - the code has `logger.transcript.info()` but the log shows `[DEBUG]`.

Wait, let me look more carefully at the log output:
```
[2025-12-12T10:03:58.296Z] [DEBUG] [transcript] Claude projects directory: /Users/joe/.claude/projects
```

But the code says:
```typescript
logger.transcript.info(`  Claude projects dir: ${this.claudeProjectsDir}`);
```

The log message is different - the log shows "Claude projects directory:" but the code says "Claude projects dir:". This suggests either:
1. There's an older version running (not rebuilt)
2. There's old code in the built JS files

Let me check if maybe the project wasn't rebuilt after the logging changes. The debug logs are showing different message formats than what's in the source.

Actually, looking at the log file again:
```
[DEBUG] [transcript] Claude projects directory: /Users/joe/.claude/projects
[DEBUG] [transcript] Expected folder name: -Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall
[DEBUG] [transcript] Found 35201 transcripts in Claude cache
```

And the source has:
```typescript
logger.transcript.info(`  Claude projects dir: ${this.claudeProjectsDir}`);
logger.transcript.debug('Claude projects directory exists');  // This one!
```

Ah! The "Claude projects directory" log at DEBUG level on line 82 is a different log statement than the INFO one. So the INFO logs aren't appearing but the DEBUG logs are.

But wait - the INFO log "Searching for Claude project transcripts..." should appear BEFORE the DEBUG "Claude projects directory exists" log. But I don't see it in the grep output. That suggests either:
1. The code hasn't been rebuilt


2. There's something filtering INFO logs (but that doesn't make sense, DEBUG is lower priority than INFO)

I suspect there might be a logging configuration issue preventing INFO-level messages from being captured. The log configuration could be inadvertently suppressing higher-priority logs while allowing DEBUG messages through.

## Output

The INFO logging is in the source, but the recall.log shows DEBUG-level messages with different text. This suggests the code may not have been rebuilt. Let me check:
