## Thought

The user wants me to migrate from sqlite-vec to Orama for vector search. This is a significant change that will involve:

1. Replacing the vector-store.ts with Orama
2. Replacing the thinking-vector-store.ts with Orama
3. Updating the search engines
4. Removing sqlite-vec dependencies
5. Updating the database.ts utility (may no longer need the mutex stuff)

Let me first understand the current structure better and then plan the migration.

Key files to modify:
- src/core/vector-store.ts - replace with Orama
- src/core/thinking-vector-store.ts - replace with Orama
- src/core/search.ts - update to use new vector store
- src/core/thinking-search.ts - update to use new vector store
- src/utils/database.ts - simplify or remove mutex logic
- package.json - add orama, remove sqlite-vec and better-sqlite3 if no longer needed

Let me start by reading the current package.json and understanding the dependencies, then plan the migration.

## Output

I'll migrate local-recall from sqlite-vec to Orama. Let me start by understanding the current structure and planning the migration.
