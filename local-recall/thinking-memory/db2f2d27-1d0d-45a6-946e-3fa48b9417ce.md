## Thought

The commit and push are complete. Let me provide a summary to the user about what was accomplished and what remains.

## Output

Committed and pushed successfully. Here's the summary:

**Committed (346e499):** `feat: migrate memory storage from markdown to JSONL format`

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
The JSONL storage migration introduces a **generic store pattern** (`JsonlStore<TEntry, TMemory>`) that both `EpisodicJsonlStore` and `ThinkingJsonlStore` extend. This design:
1. **Append-only log semantics** - Entries are appended, never modified in place
2. **Replay-based state** - On load, entries are replayed to build current state
3. **Compaction** - When file grows too large, rewrite with only active state
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

**Completed tasks:**
- Core JSONL infrastructure (types, generic store, episodic/thinking stores)
- Migration service for markdown-to-JSONL conversion
- Updated MemoryManager and ThinkingMemoryManager
- Unit tests (292 pass)
- Version bumped to 0.1.7

**Remaining tasks from the plan:**
- Update VectorStore to use pre-computed embeddings from JSONL
- Update ThinkingVectorStore for pre-computed embeddings  
- Implement auto-compaction integration (check at startup, periodic in MCP daemon)

Would you like me to continue with the remaining tasks?
