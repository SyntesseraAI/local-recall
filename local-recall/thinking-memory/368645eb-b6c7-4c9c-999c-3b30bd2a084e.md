The edit was successful. Now synthetic transcripts will be checked before copying, not just cleaned up afterward. The flow is now:

1. Clean up existing synthetic files from local folder
2. List source transcripts from Claude's cache
3. For each transcript to copy, check if it's synthetic first - if so, skip it
4. Copy non-synthetic transcripts

This is more efficient since we avoid copying files we'll just delete later.
