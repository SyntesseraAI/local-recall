## Thought

Good, I see the MCP server structure. There are periodic vector syncs every 10 minutes. I can add compaction checks there. Let me update the server to:

1. Use `syncWithJsonlStore` instead of the old `sync` method
2. Add compaction checks after vector sync
3. Run migration if needed on startup

Let me update the server to integrate these changes.

## Output

Now I'll update the MCP server to:
1. Use `syncWithJsonlStore` for the new JSONL-based sync
2. Add auto-compaction checks
3. Run migration on startup
