## Thought

No results found for "user profile" or "orchestrator" in this codebase. The user might be referring to something else - perhaps the hooks system, the MCP server, or something in a different context. Let me check the hooks configuration file they have open.

## Output

I don't see any "user profile" or "orchestrator" references in the local-recall codebase. You have `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/config/hooks.json` open - let me check that file and the broader plugin structure to understand what you're referring to.
