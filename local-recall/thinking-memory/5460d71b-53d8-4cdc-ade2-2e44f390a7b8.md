## Thought

All 3 tests pass now:
1. "should spawn claude -p with a simple prompt..." - 3477ms ✓
2. "should spawn quickly (under 1 second to start)" - 2ms ✓

## Output

All 3 tests pass now. The fix works - response times are now around 2-3 seconds instead of timing out. Let me run the full test suite to make sure nothing else broke:
