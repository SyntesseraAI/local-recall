The user wants to use a special token at the start of the prompt to detect extraction processes, rather than checking for the actual prompt content. This way they can test with different prompts without triggering the recursion guard.

Let me add a token like "[EXTRACTION_PROCESS]" at the start of the prompt when calling Claude for keywords, and then check for that token in the recursion guard.
