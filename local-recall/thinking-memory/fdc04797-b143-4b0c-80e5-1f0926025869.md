## Thought

The user is reporting an error from the user prompt submit hook. The error is an AbortError indicating that a child process operation was aborted. This is likely happening when the hook times out or when the Claude subprocess is killed.

Let me look at the user-prompt-submit hook to understand what's happening and fix the issue.

## Output

Let me investigate the user-prompt-submit hook to understand this abort error.
