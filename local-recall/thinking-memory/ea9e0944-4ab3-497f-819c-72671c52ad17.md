This is just the permissions file. The MCP server config is likely in the user's global Claude settings or in the mcpServers configuration. The user mentioned "it's the env variable" so they just want to know what to set.

To enable episodic memory processing, they need to set:
```
LOCAL_RECALL_EPISODIC_ENABLED=true
```

This needs to be added to the `env` section of the MCP server configuration where the local-recall server is defined. Since I can't see their global settings, I should tell them what to add.
