The user is asking if the hooks are working. This is a direct question about the local-recall system's hooks functionality. Let me check what hooks are configured and test if they're working properly.

From the context, I can see:
1. There's a SessionStart hook that should have run when this session started
2. There's a UserPromptSubmit hook that should run when the user submits a prompt
3. There's a Stop hook that runs when Claude stops processing

I can see in the system reminder that there was a callback hook success message:
"SessionStart:Callback hook success: Success"

This suggests the SessionStart hook did execute successfully. However, I should verify:
1. If the hooks are properly configured
2. If the built scripts exist
3. If the hooks are actually working as expected

Let me check the hooks configuration and the built scripts.
