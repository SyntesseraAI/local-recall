## Thought

Now let me check how data is loaded into SQLite. Looking at the vector-store.ts code I already read, I can see:1. The `VectorStore.add()` method adds individual memories with their embeddings
2. The `VectorStore.sync()` method syncs the vector store with file-based memories

But the user wants to know the full flow - how/when does data get loaded. Let me look at:
- How the vector store is initialized and populated
- When sync happens (during search? on startup?)Let me check the search.ts file and user-prompt-submit.ts to understand the full flow:

## Output

Now let me trace how data gets loaded into SQLite. Let me check the search engine and the user-prompt-submit hook:
