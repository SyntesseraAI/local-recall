The user wants a cleaner architecture:

1. `transcript.ts` should handle ALL parsing - take raw transcript content (the JSONL string) and return memory suggestions
2. `stop.ts` should just read the file, pass it to transcript.ts, and save the resulting memories

This removes duplication and makes the transcript parsing reusable. Let me refactor this properly.

So the flow would be:
- `stop.ts`: reads raw JSONL file → passes to `transcript.ts` → gets back memory suggestions → saves them
- `transcript.ts`: takes raw JSONL string → parses all messages → analyzes for memories → returns memory suggestions

I need to:
1. Add a new function in `transcript.ts` that takes raw JSONL content and returns memory suggestions
2. Simplify `stop.ts` to just use that function

Let me update the todo and start working on this.
