## Thought

The user is pointing out that the test command (`npm test`) runs vitest in watch mode by default, which hangs waiting for file changes. This is normal behavior for vitest - by default it runs in watch mode. To run tests once and exit, we should use `vitest run`. Let me check if there's a need to fix the package.json script or note that to the user.

The test already succeeded - all 289 tests passed. The "hanging" behavior is just vitest's watch mode waiting for changes. I already killed that process.

Let me now run lint with the new config.

## Output
