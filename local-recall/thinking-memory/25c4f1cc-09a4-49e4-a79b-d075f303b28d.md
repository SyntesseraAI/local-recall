## Thought

Now let me fix the code. The best approach is to have `stop.ts` import and use the parsing function from `transcript.ts` rather than maintaining duplicate logic.

Looking at `transcript.ts`, it has `parseRawMessage` function that correctly handles both text and thinking extraction. But it's not exported. I should either:
1. Export `parseRawMessage` from `transcript.ts` and use it in `stop.ts`
2. Or use the helper functions `extractTextFromBlocks` and `extractThinkingFromBlocks`

Actually, looking more closely at `transcript.ts`:
- `extractTextFromBlocks` and `extractThinkingFromBlocks` are not exported
- `parseRawMessage` is not exported
- Only `parseTranscript`, `extractNewMessages`, `analyzeForMemories`, and `readStdin` are exported

So I need to either:
1. Export the helper functions from `transcript.ts`
2. Or fix `stop.ts` inline

Given the structure, I think the cleanest fix is to:
1. Export the extraction functions from `transcript.ts`
2. Import and use them in `stop.ts`

Let me do that.

## Output

The cleanest fix is to export the extraction helpers from `transcript.ts` and use them in `stop.ts`. Let me do that:
