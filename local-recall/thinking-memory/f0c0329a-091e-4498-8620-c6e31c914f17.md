## Thought

The user wants to change the storage format from individual markdown files to JSONL (JSON Lines) format. This is a significant architectural change that will affect multiple components. Let me think through this carefully.

Key changes needed:
1. New JSONL format with "add", "delete", and "embeddings" entry types
2. Two files: one for episodic memories, one for thinking memories
3. Migration from existing markdown files to JSONL
4. Update Orama vector store to work with this new format
5. Loading logic that processes the JSONL log to get current state

This is a substantial refactor that requires careful planning. I should use EnterPlanMode since:
- It involves architectural decisions (how to structure the JSONL format)
- It affects multiple files and components
- There are multiple valid approaches
- The user explicitly asked me to "ultrathink and make a plan"

Let me enter plan mode to properly analyze and design this.

## Output

This is a significant architectural change that will touch multiple components. Let me enter plan mode to thoroughly analyze the codebase and design a proper implementation approach.
