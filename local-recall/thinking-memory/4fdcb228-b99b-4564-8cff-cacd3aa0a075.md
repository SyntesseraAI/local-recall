## Thought

Aha! So:

1. The built script exists at `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/user-prompt-submit.js`
2. But there's no `.claude/` directory in this project, which means the hooks must be configured elsewhere (probably globally or in the parent settings)
3. The SessionStart hook IS working, but UserPromptSubmit is not firing

The issue is that the UserPromptSubmit hook is not configured. The SessionStart hook is working (we can see it in the logs and it ran at the start of this session), but the UserPromptSubmit hook never fires.

Let me provide a summary to the user about what's working and what's not.

## Output

**Summary of hook status:**

✅ **Working:**
- SessionStart hook - fires successfully, found 8 relevant memories
- Hook outputs valid JSON with `hookSpecificOutput` structure
- Built scripts exist at `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/`

❌ **Not working:**
- **UserPromptSubmit hook is NOT firing** - no log entries for it
- No `.claude/` directory in this project for local configuration

The UserPromptSubmit hook **does return JSON** (as shown in the code), but it's **not configured to run**. Your SessionStart hook is working because it's likely configured globally or in a parent settings file.

**To fix this**, you need to add the UserPromptSubmit hook to your Claude Code settings. The hook should be at:
```
dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/user-prompt-submit.js
```

Would you like me to help you set up the UserPromptSubmit hook configuration, or check where your current hooks are configured?
