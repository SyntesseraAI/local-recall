Looking at the code, I can see that on session start:

1. It creates a new `MemoryManager` instance (line 57)
2. It calls `listMemories()` to get ALL memories (line 58)
3. It then sorts by `occurred_at` timestamp and takes the 5 most recent (lines 61-63)

So it's a full reload - all memories are loaded from disk each time. There's no delta/incremental loading. The code reads all memory files fresh on each session start.

Let me also check if there's any caching mechanism in the MemoryManager to be thorough.
