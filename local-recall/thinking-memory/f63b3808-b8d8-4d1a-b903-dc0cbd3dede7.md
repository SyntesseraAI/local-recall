## Thought

Interesting! There are 0 files with `hook_response` in the current project's transcripts. This is strange because we saw `hook_response` entries in the recall.log from the daemon.The daemon was reading transcripts that had `hook_response` entries, but those transcripts might be from a different project or have since been cleaned up.Let me think about this differently:1. The hooks ARE working for this current session (I saw "SessionStart:Callback hook success: Success" in my system reminder at the start of this conversation)2. The transcripts I'm looking at might not have `hook_response` recorded - maybe Claude Code doesn't write those to transcripts, or they're written differently
3. The recall.log entries showing `stdout:""` were from the daemon processing transcripts from OTHER sessions or projectsLet me check if the hooks are actually being triggered in this current session. The system reminder at the start showed: "SessionStart:Callback hook success: Success" - that proves the hook ran!

Wait - the system reminder at the very start of this conversation said:
```
<system-reminder>SessionStart:Callback hook success: Success</system-reminder>
```This means the SessionStart hook DID run and was successful for THIS session. But the user says hooks aren't working "for users". Let me ask: are we talking about:1. Users who have installed the plugin from the marketplace but hooks don't trigger for them?2. This specific installation where hooks seem to work but maybe don't produce visible output?Let me also check if the hook output is actually being injected into the context. I should see memories loaded at the start of this session if the hooks work.Actually, looking at the conversation again, I don't see any "Local Recall: Recent Memories" output at the very beginning. The only system-reminder I see is "SessionStart:Callback hook success: Success" which suggests the hook ran but maybe its output wasn't included?Wait - that's a different format. The hook should output markdown like "# Local Recall: Recent Memories" but the system reminder shows "SessionStart:Callback hook success: Success".This might be a different hook entirely - maybe there's a callback hook that just logs success/failure, separate from the actual content injection hook.Let me search for how "Callback" hooks work in the Claude Code ecosystem.

## Output

I see that the current session has `SessionStart:Callback hook success: Success` in the system reminder. But I don't see the actual memory content being injected at session start. Let me investigate this callback mechanism:
