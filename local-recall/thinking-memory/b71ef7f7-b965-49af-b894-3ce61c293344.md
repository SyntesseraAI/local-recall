Two issues:1. The `keyword-extractor` package was removed but is still used in `markdown.ts`
2. The esbuild can't bundle native `.node` modules from `onnxruntime-node` (used by fastembed) and also `better-sqlite3`

For issue 1, I need to remove the keyword-extractor usage from markdown.ts.

For issue 2, I need to update the build script to mark these packages as external since they have native bindings that can't be bundled.Let me fix these.
