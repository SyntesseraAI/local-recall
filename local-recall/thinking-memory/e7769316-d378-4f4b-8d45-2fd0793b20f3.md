## Thought

I found the issue! Looking at the transcript log entries, I can see the hook_response from Claude's transcript shows:

```json
"hook_name":"SessionStart:Callback","hook_event":"SessionStart","stdout":"","stderr":""
```

The hooks are executing but returning **empty stdout**! This is critical - the hooks are running, they're just not outputting anything.

Let me look at why this might be happening. The hooks should output to console.log(), and that should appear in stdout. Let me check:

1. Check if there's an issue with the hook receiving the correct input JSON
2. Check if there's a silent error occurring
3. Try to run the hooks manually to see what happens

Let me also search for any actual hook execution logs (from the hooks themselves, not transcript extraction).

## Output

**FOUND THE ISSUE!** The logs show the hooks are executing but returning **empty stdout**:

```json
"hook_name":"SessionStart:Callback","hook_event":"SessionStart","stdout":"","stderr":""
```

Let me investigate why the hooks produce no output:
