Good, now I need to update the `findClaudeProjectDir` method to use this new approach as the primary method. Let me update it to:

1. First try the path-to-dashes naming convention (primary approach)
2. Then fall back to checking `cwd` in transcript files
3. Remove the hash-based approach since it was wrong

Let me update the method.
