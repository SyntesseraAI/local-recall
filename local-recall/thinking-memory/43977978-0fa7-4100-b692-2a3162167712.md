## Thought

Let me now present my comprehensive findings and recommendations to the user.

## Output

## Research Summary: Claude Plugins & Rules System

### Key Findings

**There is no formal "Rules system"** in Claude Code. Behavior is controlled through:
1. **Skills** (model-invoked, autonomously triggered)
2. **Settings files** (permissions, tool configuration)
3. **CLAUDE.md files** (instructions/context)
4. **Hooks** (event-driven automation)
5. **MCP tool descriptions**

### Current State of local-recall

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Hooks | ✅ Working - SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit inject memories |
| MCP Tools | ⚠️ Minimal descriptions - could be improved |
| Skills | ❌ **MISSING** - No skills directory in plugin |

The plugin has **no skills**, which is a major opportunity.

### Why Skills Matter Most

Skills are the **primary mechanism for proactive behavior**. When Claude starts a conversation, it reads all skill descriptions (~100 words each) and autonomously decides when to use them based on context matching.

From the superpowers plugin example:
```yaml
---
name: using-superpowers
description: Use when starting any conversation - establishes mandatory workflows...
---
```

This gets loaded into Claude's system prompt, and Claude decides to invoke it based on the description.

### Recommendations for local-recall

#### 1. Create a "check-memories" Skill (High Impact)

Create `skills/check-memories/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: check-memories
description: This skill should be used when making architectural decisions, choosing implementation approaches, debugging issues, or when the user asks "how did we solve this before", "what was the decision about X", "have we done this before". Check local-recall memories for relevant context before making decisions.
---
```

The skill body would instruct Claude to:
- Search episodic memories before making decisions
- Search thinking memories for similar reasoning patterns
- Consider past decisions before proposing new approaches

#### 2. Improve MCP Tool Descriptions (Medium Impact)

Current (minimal):
```
'Search episodic memories using semantic vector similarity'
```

Better (with triggers):
```
'Search episodic memories for past decisions, architectural choices, bug fixes, user preferences, and project conventions. Use before making significant decisions or when the user asks about previous work. Returns relevant context from past sessions.'
```

#### 3. Create a "proactive-recall" Skill (High Impact)

A skill specifically for decision-making contexts:

```yaml
---
name: proactive-recall
description: This skill should be used when choosing between implementation options, deciding on architecture, selecting libraries, debugging complex issues, or making any decision that previous context might inform. Automatically searches local-recall before proposing solutions.
---
```

### Implementation Priority

1. **Create skills directory** in the plugin
2. **Add "check-memories" skill** with strong trigger descriptions
3. **Update MCP tool descriptions** to include more context about when/why
4. **Consider a SessionStart hook enhancement** to remind Claude about memory availability

Would you like me to implement any of these recommendations?
