The user wants me to remove the episodic memory processing from the MCP config. Let me first check the MCP server configuration and the daemon processing. I'll also need to check what controls episodic memory processing.

Looking at the server.ts file I read earlier:
- It has `episodicEnabled` config that controls processing
- The daemon runs both episodic and thinking extraction

The user wants to disable episodic memory processing. Let me:
1. First mark the current task as complete
2. Then update the MCP server to not run episodic memory processing

Actually, looking at my current task list, I should first complete the renaming task, then address the new request.
