I can see the thinking extractor. The best place to add a synthetic filter would be either:

1. In `parseTranscriptForThinking()` - early exit if we detect synthetic model
2. In `processTranscript()` - check before full processing
3. In the `TranscriptCollector` - filter at collection time

Option 2 seems best - add a check in `processTranscript()` right after reading the raw content to see if it's a synthetic transcript. That way we avoid processing synthetic files entirely.

Let me also check the `transcript-collector.ts` to see if there's a good place to filter there.
