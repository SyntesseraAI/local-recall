Now I understand the current implementation. Let me also check the thinking memory files to understand their structure, then I can make all the changes.

I need to:
1. Remove `index_rebuild` and `memory_list` from tools
2. Rename `memory_create`, `memory_get`, `memory_search` to `episodic_create`, `episodic_get`, `episodic_search`
3. Add `thinking_get` and `thinking_search` tools
4. Rename "thinking-memories" folder to "thinking-memory"

Let me check the thinking memory manager and related files first.
