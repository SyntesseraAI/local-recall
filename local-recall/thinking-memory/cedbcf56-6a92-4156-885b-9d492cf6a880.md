Now I can see the pattern clearly. Here's the summary:

**Evidence of thinking in transcripts:**

1. **Model name**: `claude-opus-4-5-20251101` (Opus 4.5) - this model has extended thinking
2. **thinkingMetadata**: On user message entries with `level: "high"`, `disabled: false`
3. **Thinking content blocks**: In assistant messages with `type: "thinking"`, `thinking: "<content>"`, `signature: "<sig>"`

**Synthetic transcripts:**
- Model is `<synthetic>` - these appear to be processed/condensed transcripts (for memory extraction)
- They don't have thinking blocks
- The content shows they're using memory extraction prompts like `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]`

Let me provide a clear summary to the user.
