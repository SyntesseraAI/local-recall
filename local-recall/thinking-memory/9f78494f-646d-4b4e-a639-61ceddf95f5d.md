## Thought

Interesting! The test results show:1. `should spawn quickly (under 1 second to start)` - PASSED with 4ms spawn time and PID 17454
2. `should spawn claude -p with a simple prompt and respond within 15 seconds` - FAILED because it timed out (15 seconds) with no stdout
3. `should handle keyword extraction prompt format` - FAILED because it timed out (20 seconds) with no stdoutSo the Claude CLI spawns quickly, but then hangs and never produces output. This confirms the user's suspicion - the spawn starts but then something blocks it.

This could be due to:1. The `--strict-mcp-config` flag causing issues2. Claude CLI waiting for something (authentication, API key, network)3. Some initialization issue

Let me run a simpler test with just `--version` to see if basic commands work:

## Output

The tests reveal the issue clearly. The spawn happens immediately (4ms), but the Claude CLI hangs and never responds. Let me run a simpler test:
