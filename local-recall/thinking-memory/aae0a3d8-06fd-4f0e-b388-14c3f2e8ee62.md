## Thought

Both memory types are already enabled by default in `types.ts`:
- Line 118: `episodicEnabled: z.boolean().default(true)`
- Line 121: `thinkingEnabled: z.boolean().default(true)`

Both versions are at 0.1.1. I should bump them to 0.1.2.

Let me make the edits and then commit/push.

## Output

Good news - both memory types (`episodicEnabled` and `thinkingEnabled`) are already enabled by default in `types.ts`. I'll bump the version from `0.1.1` to `0.1.2` in both files, then commit and push.
