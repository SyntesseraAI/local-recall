## Thought

The documentation doesn't show `LOCAL_RECALL_EPISODIC_ENABLED` in the MCP server configuration. The defaults already have `episodicEnabled: false` and `thinkingEnabled: true`, which is what the user wants.

The user mentioned removing an env var from the MCP config - but looking at the documentation, there's no env var for episodic enabled being set. The defaults should already be correct.

Let me verify the build works and summarize the current state. Since `episodicEnabled` defaults to `false`, the episodic memory processing is already disabled by default. The user may have been confused or there may be a local configuration they're using that sets this.

## Output

The documentation doesn't show `LOCAL_RECALL_EPISODIC_ENABLED` in the MCP config - and looking at the defaults in `types.ts`:

- `episodicEnabled` defaults to `false` (already disabled)
- `thinkingEnabled` defaults to `true` (enabled)

So episodic memory processing is already disabled by default. The daemon will only run if explicitly enabled via `LOCAL_RECALL_EPISODIC_ENABLED=true`.

Let me verify the build works:
