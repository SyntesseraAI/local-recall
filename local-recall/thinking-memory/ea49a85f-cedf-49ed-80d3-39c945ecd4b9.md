## Thought

The plan is complete. Let me exit plan mode so the user can approve it and I can implement.

## Output

The plan is complete. This restructuring will:

1. Move `.claude-plugin/` to the root level with `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`
2. Move plugin content to `local-recall-plugin/` at root
3. Use `syntessera-marketplace` as the marketplace name (matching code-farm)
4. Update the build script to output to the new location
