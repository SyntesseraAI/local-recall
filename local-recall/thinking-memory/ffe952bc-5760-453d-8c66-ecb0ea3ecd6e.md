I see the hook currently fetches 5 results with `limit: 5`. The user wants:
1. Default to 10 items
2. Include up to 25 items if they have similarity over 90%

I need to:
1. Change the limit to 25 (the max)
2. Filter results to keep:
   - First 10 items regardless of score
   - Additional items (up to 25 total) only if score >= 0.90

Let me update the code.
