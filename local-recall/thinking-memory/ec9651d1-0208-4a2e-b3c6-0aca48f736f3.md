## Thought

Interesting findings:
1. There's no `hooks.json` file in the root - this is expected based on the git status which didn't show it
2. The `scripts/hooks/` directory doesn't exist - the project hasn't been built yet
3. The memory index DOES exist at `local-recall/index.json`
4. There are 9 memory files in the `local-recall/memories/` directory

However, the SessionStart hook did execute successfully according to the system message. This suggests that hooks might be configured elsewhere (probably in `.claude/settings.json`), or the hooks are working despite the missing files.

Let me check if there's a build process that needs to be run, and also check the .claude settings.

## Output

I found some issues - the hooks haven't been built yet! The `scripts/hooks/` directory doesn't exist, but I can see:

**Good news:**
- ✅ The SessionStart hook DID execute successfully (shown in the startup message)
- ✅ Memory index exists at [local-recall/index.json](local-recall/index.json)
- ✅ 9 memory files are present in [local-recall/memories/](local-recall/memories/)

**Issues:**
- ❌ The `hooks.json` file doesn't exist
- ❌ The built hook scripts in `scripts/hooks/` don't exist

The hooks are probably working because they might be configured directly in your `.claude/settings.json`. Let me check:
