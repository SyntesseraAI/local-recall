## Thought

The user wants me to:
1. Switch from fastembed to Ollama for embeddings
2. Use the best & fastest small model
3. Remove redundant code
4. Use "ultrathink" (extended thinking) to sort out documentation

Let me start by understanding the current embedding setup and then plan the migration to Ollama.

First, let me search for relevant memories and explore the codebase to understand the current embedding architecture.

## Output

I'll help you migrate from fastembed to Ollama for embeddings. Let me first explore the current embedding architecture and plan the changes.
