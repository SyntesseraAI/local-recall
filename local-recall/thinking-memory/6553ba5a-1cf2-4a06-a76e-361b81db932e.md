## Thought

Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me also check the thinking memory and the hooks to understand the full picture. Then I'll design the JSONL architecture.

The key insight is that the user wants to replace:
1. Individual markdown files (episodic-memory/*.md, thinking-memory/*.md)
2. Orama index files (orama-episodic-index.json, orama-thinking-index.json)

With a unified JSONL format:
1. episodic.jsonl - contains add, delete, embeddings entries for episodic memories
2. thinking.jsonl - contains add, delete, embeddings entries for thinking memories

This is an append-only log format that can be "replayed" to reconstruct state.

Let me now ask some clarifying questions and then design the plan.

## Output

I have a comprehensive understanding of the architecture. Before finalizing the plan, I have a few clarifying questions:
