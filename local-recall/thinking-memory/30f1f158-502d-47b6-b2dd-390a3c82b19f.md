## Thought

This is very interesting! The pattern for this message is:
1. thinking
2. text
3. tool_use
4. thinking
5. text
6. tool_use

This shows **interleaved thinking** - Claude thinks, produces output, uses a tool, then thinks again, produces more output, and uses another tool. All within the same message (same `message.id`).

This confirms that:
1. Yes, there CAN be multiple thinking blocks in a single Claude response
2. The current code handles this correctly by aggregating all thinking parts

However, there's a potential issue: the current code joins ALL thinking parts and ALL text parts separately. But in the interleaved case, the thinking-output pairs might be:
- thought1 → text1 
- thought2 → text2

But the current code would produce:
- thought1 + thought2 → text1 + text2

This might lose the correspondence between specific thoughts and their outputs. Let me check the actual thinking content to understand if this matters.

## Output

Interesting! This shows **interleaved thinking**: thinking → text → tool_use → thinking → text → tool_use

Let me see the actual thinking content to understand the interleaving:
