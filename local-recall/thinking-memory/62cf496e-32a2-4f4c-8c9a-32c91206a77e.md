The user is asking "what now?" after seeing all the memories about the Stop hook not firing in the VS Code extension. Let me summarize the situation:

1. The Stop hook is not firing in VS Code extension
2. This means memories are not being created automatically 
3. The memories that exist were loaded successfully
4. The UserPromptSubmit hook is working (as evidenced by the relevant memories being shown)

The user is likely asking what they should do about this situation. Based on the context, I should:

1. Explain the current status clearly
2. Offer actionable next steps
3. Potentially investigate VS Code extension hook support via documentation
4. Or implement an alternative solution

Let me provide a clear, concise answer with actionable options.
