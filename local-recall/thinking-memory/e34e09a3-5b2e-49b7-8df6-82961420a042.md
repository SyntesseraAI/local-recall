## Thought

The user is asking whether the MCP server daemon runs on startup. Let me think about what I know from the context provided and the CLAUDE.md documentation.

From CLAUDE.md:
- The MCP server runs a background daemon that syncs transcripts and processes them every 5 minutes
- The daemon is part of the MCP server lifecycle

From the memories injected:
- "The MCP server (`src/mcp-server/server.ts`) runs a background daemon that automatically processes transcripts every 5 minutes when `episodicEnabled` is true"
- "The daemon is not a separate process but runs as part of the MCP server lifecycle"

So the daemon runs as part of the MCP server. The question is: does it run immediately on startup, or does it wait for the first 5-minute interval?

I should check the actual code to give an accurate answer. Let me look at the MCP server source.

## Output

Let me check the MCP server code to see when the daemon starts processing:
