## Thought

The user is asking about reducing calls to the user profile from an orchestrator. This seems to be related to some code in the local-recall project. Let me search for references to "user profile" and "orchestrator" to understand the context better.

Looking at the git status and the project structure, this is the local-recall project - a memory system for AI coding assistants. The user is asking about reducing calls to "user profile" from an "orchestrator".

Let me search for these terms in the codebase to understand what they're referring to.

## Output

Let me search for references to user profile and orchestrator in the codebase to understand the current implementation.
