## Thought

I see there are several places in `findClaudeProjectDir` that check for `.jsonl` files:
1. Line 97: `files.some((f) => f.endsWith('.jsonl'))` - checking if directory has transcripts
2. Line 118: `files.filter((f) => f.endsWith('.jsonl'))` - filtering for jsonl files in fallback
3. Line 151: `files.some((f) => f.endsWith('.jsonl'))` - checking in basename match fallback

These are all used to determine if a directory is a Claude project directory - not for processing. However, for consistency and to avoid false positives from non-UUID .jsonl files, I should update these as well to check for UUID filenames.

Let me update these occurrences.

## Output

I should also update the `findClaudeProjectDir` method to use UUID validation when checking for transcript files. This ensures consistency and avoids false positives from non-UUID `.jsonl` files.
