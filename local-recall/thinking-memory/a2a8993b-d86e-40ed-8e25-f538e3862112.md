## Thought

Now I can see the key change:- `.gitignore` is modified (to allow `local-recall-plugin/scripts/`)- `local-recall-plugin/scripts/` is now untracked (ready to be added)

The user needs to:
1. Add the scripts to Git: `git add local-recall-plugin/scripts/`2. Commit the changes (including the .gitignore change)
3. Push to GitHub4. Update the plugin in Claude Code to refresh the cache

Let me summarize this for the user.

## Output

## Summary

**Problem:** The MCP server was failing because the `local-recall-plugin/scripts/` directory was gitignored and never made it to GitHub. When Claude Code fetched the plugin from `syntesseraai/local-recall`, the MCP server file didn't exist.

**Fix Applied:** Updated `.gitignore` to include the plugin scripts:
- Changed `scripts/` → `/scripts/` (only ignore root scripts dir)
- Added `!local-recall-plugin/scripts/` (explicitly include plugin scripts)

## Next Steps

You need to commit and push these changes:

```bash
# Add the scripts and .gitignore changes
git add .gitignore local-recall-plugin/scripts/

# Commit
git commit -m "fix: Include bundled MCP server in plugin distribution

The local-recall-plugin/scripts/ directory was gitignored, preventing
the MCP server from being distributed via the Claude Code marketplace.

🤖 Generated with Claude Code"

# Push to GitHub
git push

# Then update the plugin in Claude Code
/plugin update syntesseraai-local-recall
```

Would you like me to run these commands?

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Claude Code Plugin Distribution Gotcha:**
- Plugins fetched from GitHub only include files **committed to Git**
- Bundled/build outputs needed at runtime must be committed (or use npm install hooks)
- The `!pattern` syntax in `.gitignore` negates previous ignore rules
