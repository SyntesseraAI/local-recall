## Thought

The user is asking if I'm seeing any information about stew in my context - they might be testing whether the local-recall system is injecting memories about stew into my context via the hooks.

Let me think about what's in my context:
1. The CLAUDE.md file with project instructions
2. The session start hook output (just said "Success")
3. The user prompt submit hook output (just said "Success")
4. Our conversation history where we discussed stew

I don't see any injected memories about stew from the hooks - the hook outputs just show "Success" without any memory content being injected. The only stew-related content is from our conversation itself.

I should be honest about what I'm seeing.

## Output

No - the only stew-related content I see is from our conversation just now (you asking about it, me responding).

The hooks are showing "Success" but aren't injecting any memory content about stew into my context. This could mean:

1. The `UserPromptSubmit` hook isn't finding matches for "stew" in the keyword index
2. The hook might not be outputting matched memories to stdout (which is how context gets injected)
3. No memory with "stew" as a keyword exists yet

Earlier when we searched, the memory system only had a record of you *asking* about stew - with keywords like "search", "memory", "conversations", "sausages" - but "stew" itself wasn't a keyword in that memory.

Want me to create a memory about your stew preference so it shows up in future sessions?
