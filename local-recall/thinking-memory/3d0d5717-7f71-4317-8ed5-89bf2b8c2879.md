## Thought

The user wants me to implement all three recommendations:
1. Create a skills directory and add a "check-memories" skill
2. Improve MCP tool descriptions
3. Create a "proactive-recall" skill

Let me also consider improving the SessionStart hook to remind Claude about memory availability.

I should use the brainstorming skill first since this is a significant implementation task. But actually, I have clear requirements from my research - the user has approved my recommendations. Let me proceed with implementation.

Let me create a todo list and start implementing.

## Output

I'll implement all three recommendations. Let me create a todo list and get started.
