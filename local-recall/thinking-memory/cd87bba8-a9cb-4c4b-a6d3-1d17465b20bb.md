## Thought

The user wants a combination of:
- Smarter heuristics (option 2)
- User-triggered (option 4)

So we need to:
1. Improve the pattern matching to be smarter about detecting valuable content
2. Add explicit user triggers like "remember this", "save this for later", etc.

Let me think about what would be valuable to remember:

**User-triggered patterns:**
- "remember this"
- "save this"
- "don't forget"
- "note this down"
- "keep track of"
- "for future reference"
- "make a note"

**Smarter heuristics for automatic detection:**

Architectural decisions:
- "we're using X for Y"
- "the architecture is..."
- "we chose X because..."
- "this project uses..."

Bug explanations:
- "the bug was caused by..."
- "the issue was..."
- "the root cause..."
- "this fails because..."

User preferences:
- "I prefer..."
- "I like to..."
- "always use..."
- "never use..."
- "my convention is..."

Project conventions:
- "in this project we..."
- "the pattern here is..."
- "we follow..."
- "the standard is..."

Let me design this properly and implement it.

## Output

Let me design and implement this. I'll create:

1. **User-triggered patterns** - Detect when users explicitly ask to remember something
2. **Smarter heuristics** - Better detection of architectural decisions, bug root causes, preferences, and conventions
