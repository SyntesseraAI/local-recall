## Thought

The user is asking "ok, what about now?" after I identified the issue with inconsistent output formats between the SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks.

Looking at the system reminder, I can see that:
1. SessionStart hook callback succeeded
2. New log entries show SessionStart hook fired again (line 119-129)
3. Found 8 relevant memories again (line 127-128)
4. Hook completed successfully (line 129)

The user might be asking if I'm now receiving the memories. Let me check if I actually have them in my context. Looking back at my conversation, I don't see any "Local Recall: Loaded Memories" or "Local Recall: Relevant Memories" sections in my context.

So even though the hooks are firing and finding memories, I'm still not receiving them. This confirms my diagnosis that the SessionStart hook is outputting plain text instead of the JSON format that the VS Code extension expects.

The user might have already tried to fix it, or they might be testing to see if I'm now receiving memories. Let me check if I have any memories in my current context by looking for them.

I should let the user know that I'm still not seeing the memories, which confirms the issue is the output format.

## Output

I'm still not seeing the memories in my context, even though the logs show the SessionStart hook found 8 relevant memories and completed successfully (line 127-129 in the log).

This confirms the issue: the SessionStart hook is outputting plain text, but the VS Code extension expects JSON output with the `hookSpecificOutput` structure like UserPromptSubmit uses.

Let me fix the SessionStart hook to use the correct output format:
