## Thought

The user wants to test the Orama vector store implementation. Based on the CLAUDE.md file, the project recently migrated from SQLite/sqlite-vec to Orama for vector search. Let me check what's available and run some tests.

I should:
1. First check if there are existing tests for Orama
2. Run the test suite to see if things are working
3. Maybe do a quick functional test of the search

Let me start by looking for tests and then running them.

## Output

Let me run the tests for Orama to verify everything is working.
