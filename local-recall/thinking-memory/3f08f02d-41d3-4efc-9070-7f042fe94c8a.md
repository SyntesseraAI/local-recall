The user wants to know if the MCP server is configured and running. Let me check a few things:

1. Look at the .mcp.json file to see the configuration
2. Check if there's a running MCP server process
3. Look at the scripts/mcp-server directory to see if the bundled server exists

I should check these things to give the user a complete answer.
