The hooks are already built. Now let me test them:

1. **session-start.ts**: Reads JSON from stdin with session info, loads memories, and outputs them to stdout
2. **stop.ts**: Reads JSON from stdin with transcript info, analyzes for memories, creates them

Let me test both hooks. I'll need to:
1. Test session-start hook with mock JSON input
2. Test stop hook with a mock transcript

First, let me check if there are any existing memories and what the directory structure looks like.
