## Thought

Done. Let me summarize what was done.

## Output

Done. Here's what was accomplished:

**Memory types:** Both `episodicEnabled` and `thinkingEnabled` were already set to `true` by default in `src/core/types.ts:118-121`.

**Version bump:** Updated from `0.1.1` → `0.1.2` in:
- `package.json`
- `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

**Commit:** `25dfcf5` pushed to `main` with 18 new thinking memory files and the version bump.
