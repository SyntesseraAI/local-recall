## Thought

All tasks are now complete. Let me provide a summary to the user.

## Output

All tasks completed. Here's the summary:

**Commits pushed:**
1. `346e499` - Initial JSONL storage migration (v0.1.7)
2. `5093b8e` - Pre-computed embeddings and auto-compaction (v0.1.8)
3. `a8076ac` - Track processed-log.jsonl files in git

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**JSONL Storage Migration Architecture:**
1. **Append-only log pattern** - Entries (`add`, `delete`, `embedding`) are appended, never modified. On load, entries are replayed to build current state.
2. **Embedding persistence** - Embeddings stored as separate entries in JSONL, so they survive restarts without regeneration via Ollama.
3. **Auto-compaction** - When file grows large (>50MB) or has many deletions (>30%), the daemon rewrites it with only active state.
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

**Changes Summary:**
- New storage format: `episodic.jsonl` and `thinking.jsonl` (replacing markdown folders)
- `syncWithJsonlStore()` for efficient sync with embedding reuse
- Migration runs on startup, deletes old folders after success
- Version bumped to 0.1.8
- Processed log files now tracked in git for team sharing

**Note:** GitHub warned that `thinking-processed-log.jsonl` (69.5 MB) exceeds the 50 MB recommendation. If this grows larger, you may want to consider Git LFS.
