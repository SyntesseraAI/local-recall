## Thought

Good, I have a better picture now. The project has:

1. Core implementation in `src/` with:
   - Core memory management (memory.ts, index.ts, search.ts, types.ts)
   - Hooks (session-start.ts, stop.ts)
   - MCP server (server.ts, tools.ts)
   - Utilities (config.ts, fuzzy.ts, logger.ts, markdown.ts, summarize.ts, transcript.ts)

2. Documentation in `docs/`
3. Tests structure exists but seems minimal
4. Local storage directory exists with a memories folder and a recall.log

The user wants to discuss decisions that need to be made. I should ask them what specific decisions they want to discuss, or what areas they're concerned about. Based on the CLAUDE.md and current state, there are several potential decision areas:

1. How the Stop hook decides what's "memory-worthy"
2. Memory deduplication strategy
3. How scopes work and when to use which
4. Testing strategy and coverage
5. Distribution/plugin packaging
6. Index refresh strategy
7. Fuzzy search tuning

Let me ask the user what they want to discuss rather than assuming.

## Output

I've taken a look at the project. You have a solid foundation with:

- **Core implementation** complete: memory CRUD, index management, fuzzy search
- **Hooks**: session-start and stop hooks implemented
- **MCP server**: server and tools implemented
- **Documentation**: architecture, configuration, hooks, mcp-server, memory-format docs
- **Tests structure** exists (but looks minimal based on directory listing)

What decisions are on your mind? Some areas I could see needing input:

1. **Memory creation logic** - How does the stop hook decide what's "memory-worthy"?
2. **Deduplication/merging** - How to handle overlapping or duplicate memories?
3. **Scope strategy** - When to use `global` vs `file:` vs `area:`?
4. **Testing coverage** - What needs test coverage?
5. **Distribution** - Plugin packaging, npm publishing, etc.?
6. **Index/search tuning** - Fuzzy threshold, keyword extraction strategy?

What would you like to talk through?
