## Thought

Interesting! Both tests produced output:
1. With memories: shows 5 memories2. Without memories (cwd=/tmp): shows "No memories loaded"Both cases produce stdout output. So the hooks themselves work correctly.

This means the issue is NOT with the hook code. The hooks produce output in all cases.So why did the transcripts show `stdout:""`?

Let me think about this differently. Maybe:
1. The hook ran but was killed before producing output (timeout?)
2. The hook produced output but it wasn't captured
3. The transcript entry I saw was from a different scenario

Actually, wait. Let me look at the log entry again:

```json{"type":"system","subtype":"hook_response","session_id":"1ccb64e1-ee06-43e7-8a98-c216fe92e6b1","uuid":"42b4cf40-1a53-4278-aa8a-93b2d333a763","hook_name":"SessionStart:Callback","hook_event":"SessionStart","stdout":"","stderr":""}
```The key here is `"hook_name":"SessionStart:Callback"`. This has `:Callback` suffix.Let me search for what hooks are actually configured for this plugin - maybe there's a Callback hook defined that's different from the regular SessionStart hook?Or maybe this is from a different plugin entirely?

Actually, the user said the hooks aren't triggering "for users". This could mean:1. Users on OTHER machines who have the plugin installed2. Something about how the plugin is distributed vs how the local development version works

Let me check the marketplace configuration to understand how the plugin is distributed to other users.

## Output

Both tests produce output. The hooks work correctly. Let me check if the issue is with how the plugin marketplace distributes the hooks:
