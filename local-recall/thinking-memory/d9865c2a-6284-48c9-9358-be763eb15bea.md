Now I have a full picture. Let me update the CLAUDE.md documentation to reflect:

1. The removal of `index.ts` and `index.json` - replaced by SQLite with vector embeddings
2. The architecture now uses `vector-store.ts` instead
3. Update the `memory.sqlite` reference (gitignored)
4. Update the MCP tools - `index_rebuild` now syncs vector store, not rebuilds keyword index
5. Update the hooks description - they don't use `index.json` anymore
6. Update the configuration options (remove `indexRefreshInterval` if it's no longer applicable)

Let me make these edits to CLAUDE.md.
