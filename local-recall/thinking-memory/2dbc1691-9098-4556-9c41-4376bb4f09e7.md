## Thought

The user wants to expand thinking memories to include not just the thinking block, but also the assistant message that follows it. This would create a "thought + output" pair that could serve as examples for future sessions.

Let me think about this:

1. Currently, the thinking extractor extracts thinking blocks from assistant messages
2. The user wants to pair each thinking block with its corresponding assistant output
3. This would provide context on "here's how I thought, and here's what I produced"

This is definitely possible. I need to look at:
1. The thinking extractor to understand how it currently extracts thinking blocks
2. The transcript structure to understand how assistant messages are organized
3. How to pair thinking with the corresponding output

Let me read the thinking extractor to understand the current implementation.

## Output

This is a great idea - pairing thoughts with their outputs would provide much more useful context for future sessions. Let me look at the current thinking extractor to understand how we'd implement this.
