## Thought

The user is pointing out that episodic memory markdown files are still being created in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` even though there's now a JSONL storage format. They expected the markdown files to stop being created since memories should now go into the JSONL files.

Let me look at the current state and understand what's happening. I can see from the git status that there are many untracked markdown files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` and `local-recall/thinking-memory/`, as well as JSONL files like `episodic-000001.jsonl` and `thinking-000001.jsonl`.

I need to investigate the code to understand:
1. Where are the markdown files being created?
2. Was there a migration to JSONL that should have stopped MD creation?
3. What needs to change to stop creating MD files?

Let me look at the memory creation code and the recent migration changes.

## Output

Let me investigate the memory creation code to understand where the markdown files are still being generated.
