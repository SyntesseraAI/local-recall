## Thought

I'm now in plan mode. Let me explore the codebase to understand the current architecture before designing the new JSONL-based storage format.

I need to understand:
1. Current memory storage format (markdown files)
2. How Orama vector store works with memories
3. How embeddings are generated and stored
4. The memory CRUD operations
5. How thinking memories work

Let me launch multiple Explore agents to understand different aspects of the codebase.

## Output

I'll explore the codebase to understand the current architecture before designing the JSONL-based storage format.
