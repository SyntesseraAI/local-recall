## Thought

Good, I've fixed the issues:

1. Removed the `timeout` option from `spawn` - this was causing the AbortError when the child process was killed due to timeout
2. Created a `safeResolve` wrapper that ensures we only resolve once and clears the timeout
3. Moved the timeout setup earlier so `timeoutId` is defined before it's used in `safeResolve`
4. Removed the duplicate `child.on('close')` handler - now there's only one
5. Added a guard in the `close` handler to skip processing if we've already resolved

Now I should rebuild the project to apply these changes.

## Output

Now let me rebuild the project to apply these changes:
