Now I understand the structure. The current session-start hook:
1. Only retrieves episodic memories (not thinking memories)
2. Sorts by `occurred_at` which is when the original event occurred
3. Returns only 5 memories

The user's comment suggests they want the session to continue with context. Based on the system context showing both episodic and thinking memories being injected, I think the user wants the session-start to also retrieve thinking memories.

Looking at the injected context during UserPromptSubmit, I can see it includes both "# Local Recall: Relevant Memories" and "# Local Recall: Previous Thoughts". But the SessionStart hook only retrieves episodic memories.

Let me check the ThinkingMemoryManager to understand how to add thinking memories to session-start.
