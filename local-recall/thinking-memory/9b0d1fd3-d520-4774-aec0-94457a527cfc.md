## Thought

The user is asking me to analyze a transcript and extract memories. However, looking at the transcript provided, it's very minimal:

1. User asks about MCP server failing to start
2. Assistant suggests investigating logs and starting the server
3. Tools are called: Bash commands and Read
4. Results are just "Completed (no output)" or "Read X lines"

The problem is that there are NO actual results shown - just the indicators that tools were run. I don't have the actual error messages, the actual logs content, or the actual package.json content that would reveal what went wrong.

Without the actual tool results and error details, I cannot extract meaningful memories about:
- What the actual error was
- How to fix the MCP server
- What changed that caused the failure
- Root cause analysis

The transcript is essentially just showing that diagnostic steps were started but no actual findings or solutions are provided in the transcript itself.

According to the guidelines:
- DO extract: Bug fixes and the root cause analysis, architectural decisions
- DO NOT extract: Temporary debugging steps that aren't useful long-term, obvious or trivial information

Since this transcript shows only diagnostic steps being initiated without any findings, solutions, or actual results, there are no valuable memories to extract from this session. The transcript doesn't contain:
- What error was found
- How it was fixed
- What the root cause was
- Any architectural insights
- Any configuration discoveries
- Any solution that was implemented

Therefore, I should return an empty memories array.

## Output

```json
{
  "memories": []
}
```
