## Thought

The user is asking if I'm receiving context from the local-recall system. Let me check what I've received in the system reminders.

Looking at what I've received:
1. `SessionStart:Callback hook success: Success` - The session start hook ran successfully
2. `UserPromptSubmit:Callback hook success: Success` - The user prompt submit hook ran successfully (multiple times)
3. The CLAUDE.md file content was loaded as context

So yes, the hooks are running successfully. However, I don't see any actual memories being injected - just the hook success messages. This could mean:
1. There are no relevant memories for the queries
2. The daemon might not be running (hooks fall back gracefully)
3. The similarity threshold is high (0.8 default) so nothing matched

I should explain what I'm seeing.

## Output

Yes, I'm receiving context from the local-recall system. Here's what I see:

1. **Hook Success Messages** - Both `SessionStart` and `UserPromptSubmit` hooks are running successfully
2. **CLAUDE.md** - The project documentation was loaded into my context

However, I'm not seeing any actual **episodic or thinking memories** being injected. This could mean:
- The MCP daemon isn't running (hooks fall back gracefully without errors)
- No memories match the similarity threshold (default 0.8)
- The memory stores are empty or haven't been synced yet

Want me to check if the daemon is running or look at what memories exist in the `local-recall/` directory?
