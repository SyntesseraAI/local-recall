The user is reporting an issue with the user prompt submit hook but hasn't provided the actual error message. They said "I get this error:" but the message seems to be cut off. Let me ask them to provide the error details.

Wait, actually looking at the git status, I can see there are modified files including `src/hooks/user-prompt-submit.ts`. Let me first check what the current state of that file is and see if I can identify any obvious issues, but I should also ask the user for the specific error message they're seeing.

Actually, the user's message is incomplete - they said "I get this error:" but didn't include the error. I should ask them to provide the error message so I can help diagnose the issue.
