The two most recent commits haven't been pushed yet. This makes it easier - I can rewrite history safely without affecting a remote. Let me use `git filter-branch` or `git-filter-repo` to remove the local_cache files from these commits, and add local_cache/ to .gitignore.

Actually, since only the last 2 commits are affected and they haven't been pushed, the cleanest approach is:
1. Add `local_cache/` to .gitignore
2. Use `git filter-branch` to remove the files from those commits

Let me do this:
