The user is asking about the current MCP capabilities in the local-recall project. Based on the CLAUDE.md file that was provided in the system context, I can see the MCP server exposes these tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_create` | Create a new memory (idempotent) |
| `memory_get` | Retrieve a specific memory by ID |
| `memory_search` | Semantic search using vector embeddings |
| `memory_list` | List all memories with optional filtering |
| `index_rebuild` | Sync vector store with memory files |

I also have access to these tools in my current session (as indicated by the function list):
- `mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__memory_create`
- `mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__memory_get`
- `mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__memory_search`
- `mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__memory_list`
- `mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__index_rebuild`

I can provide a clear summary based on the documentation and the available tools I see.
