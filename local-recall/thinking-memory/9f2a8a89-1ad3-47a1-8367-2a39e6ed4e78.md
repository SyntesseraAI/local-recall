## Thought

There's the root cause! The `local-recall-plugin/scripts/` directory is NOT tracked in Git! When I run `git ls-files local-recall-plugin/`, it only shows:- local-recall-plugin/.mcp.json
- local-recall-plugin/config/hooks.json
- local-recall-plugin/skills/check-memories/SKILL.md
- local-recall-plugin/skills/proactive-recall/SKILL.md

The `scripts/` directory is missing from Git! Let me check the .gitignore to see if scripts are being ignored:
