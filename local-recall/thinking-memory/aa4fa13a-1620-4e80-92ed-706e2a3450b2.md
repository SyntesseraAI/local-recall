The fix is working. The logs show:
1. The old code (at 14:49:07) was saying "Claude project found but no transcripts folder"
2. The new code (at 14:50:11) correctly says "Found Claude project via path convention" and "Found 230 transcripts in Claude cache"

The fix is complete. Let me summarize what was done.
