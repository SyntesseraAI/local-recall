## Thought

This confirms that the Stop hook has never been fired. This means the Stop hook is not working in the VS Code extension environment.

Let me provide a clear answer to the user about why memories aren't being created and what alternatives there are.

## Output

**The Stop hook has never fired.** This confirms the issue.

## Root Cause

The **VS Code extension does not trigger the `Stop` hook** (or triggers it in limited circumstances). The memory creation happens in `src/hooks/stop.ts:77-108` which parses the transcript and creates memories - but it's never being called.

## Workarounds

You have two options to create memories in VS Code:

### Option 1: Use the MCP tools directly
The MCP server exposes `memory_create` which works regardless of hooks. You can ask me to create a memory:

```
"Create a memory about [topic]"
```

This uses `mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__memory_create` which works in VS Code.

### Option 2: Add a manual memory creation flow
Consider adding a `PreToolUse` or `PostToolUse` hook that triggers memory creation, or modify the `UserPromptSubmit` hook to analyze the previous response and create memories.

Would you like me to:
1. Investigate whether VS Code supports the `Stop` hook at all (via Claude Code documentation)?
2. Implement automatic memory creation in a different hook that does work (like `UserPromptSubmit` analyzing the previous turn)?
