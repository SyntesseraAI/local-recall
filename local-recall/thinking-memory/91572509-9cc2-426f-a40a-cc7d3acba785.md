## Thought

All tests pass. The deduplication fix is in place. Let me create an episodic memory about this finding.

## Output

All 288 tests pass. 

**Summary of changes:**

Added deduplication at `src/core/thinking-extractor.ts:146-148` to filter out duplicate thinking/text blocks caused by streaming artifacts. This prevents memories from containing repeated content like:
```
"Same thought...\nSame thought..."
```
