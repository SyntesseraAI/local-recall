## Thought

Good! I've created the `.claude/settings.json` file with all three hooks configured:
- SessionStart
- UserPromptSubmit
- Stop

And also the MCP server configuration. Now the hooks should be configured locally for this project. The user will need to reload or restart their Claude Code session for the UserPromptSubmit hook to start working.

## Output

Done! I've created [.claude/settings.json](.claude/settings.json) with all three hooks configured:

- **SessionStart** - Loads relevant memories when a session starts
- **UserPromptSubmit** - Searches for memories based on your prompt keywords
- **Stop** - Analyzes the transcript and creates new memories

The configuration also includes the MCP server setup.

**To activate the UserPromptSubmit hook**, you'll need to:
1. Reload or restart your Claude Code session
2. The hook will then fire whenever you submit a prompt and inject relevant memories into the context

You can verify it's working by checking [local-recall/recall.log](local-recall/recall.log) for UserPromptSubmit log entries after your next message.
