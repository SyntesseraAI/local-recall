## Thought

The user is asking me to extract memories from a transcript of a Claude Code session. Let me analyze what happened:

1. The user asked Claude to research Claude Plugins and the Rules system to help local-recall better integrate with Claude's decision-making workflow

2. Claude researched and found that there is no formal "Rules system" - instead behavior is controlled through:
   - Skills (model-invoked, autonomously triggered)
   - Settings files
   - CLAUDE.md files
   - Hooks
   - MCP tool descriptions

3. The user asked Claude to implement recommendations

4. Claude implemented:
   - Created two new skills:
     - `check-memories/SKILL.md` - for searching memories based on user queries
     - `proactive-recall/SKILL.md` - for proactively recommending memories during architectural decisions
   
   - Updated `src/mcp-server/tools.ts` to add tool descriptions
   
   - Updated the plugin configuration in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with better descriptions and keywords
   
   - Updated `package.json` version from 0.1.2 to 0.1.3
   
   - Built and tested the changes

Key memories to extract:

1. **Claude Code doesn't have a "Rules system"** - Behavior is controlled through Skills, Settings, CLAUDE.md, Hooks, and MCP tool descriptions. This is important for future work on local-recall integration.

2. **Skills are the way to extend Claude Code functionality** - Skills can be auto-discovered in `./skills/` directory and don't need manifest changes.

3. **Two skills were created for local-recall**:
   - `check-memories` - Triggered by user queries about past decisions/memories
   - `proactive-recall` - Triggered during architectural decisions to suggest relevant memories

4. **MCP tools need descriptive text** - Updated tool descriptions in `src/mcp-server/tools.ts` to help Claude understand when to use each tool.
   
I've enhanced the plugin's visibility and tracked its evolution through a version update. The marketplace listing now includes more precise descriptions and targeted keywords, making the local-recall plugin more discoverable. Simultaneously, I incremented the version number to 0.1.3, signaling the introduction of new skills and improved tool documentation.
