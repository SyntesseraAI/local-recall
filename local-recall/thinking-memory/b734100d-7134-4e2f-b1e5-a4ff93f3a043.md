## Thought

The user is saying that the hooks aren't working correctly and they don't see them trigger at all. They want me to use Gemini and ultrathink to investigate what's wrong.

Let me first understand what we're dealing with:
1. This is the local-recall project - a memory system for AI coding assistants
2. Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json` and should execute as shell commands
3. The user wants me to use Gemini (likely the gemini:codebase-analysis skill) and "ultrathink" to investigate

Let me start by:
1. Looking at the hooks configuration
2. Looking at the hook implementation files
3. Using gemini for codebase analysis

First, let me search for relevant memories about hooks issues and then investigate the codebase.

## Output

I'll investigate the hooks issue using Gemini for codebase analysis and thorough investigation. Let me start by searching for any past context about hooks and examining the current state.
