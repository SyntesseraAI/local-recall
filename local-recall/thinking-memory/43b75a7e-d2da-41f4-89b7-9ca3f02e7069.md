The user is greeting me and asking what decision we're making today. This seems like a general greeting/question. Let me check if there's any context from the git branch name or recent activity that might indicate what we're working on.

Looking at the git status:
- Current branch: `claude/create-claude-md-01PPHDFfpxRruDbNfybJi4Y4`
- Status is clean (no uncommitted changes)

The branch name suggests this might have been about creating a CLAUDE.md file, which already exists based on the context provided.

I don't have specific context about what decision needs to be made today. I should just respond conversationally and ask what they'd like to work on.
