## Thought

CLAUDE.md looks mostly good. I notice it doesn't list the LOG_LEVEL environment variable with its default. Let me check if there's anything else that needs updating. The configuration table is missing the log level entry. Let me add that. Also, I notice the Stop hook is still in the hook configuration example but it's disabled. Let me make a small update to CLAUDE.md to add the log level configuration and note that the Stop hook is disabled.

## Output

I see CLAUDE.md is missing the `LOCAL_RECALL_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. Let me add that.
