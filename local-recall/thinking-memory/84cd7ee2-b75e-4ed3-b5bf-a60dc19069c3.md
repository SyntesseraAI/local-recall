Good progress. Now let me update the todo list and work on renaming the "thinking-memories" folder to "thinking-memory". I need to:

1. Update the thinking-memory.ts file to use "thinking-memory" instead of "thinking-memories"
2. Update other files that reference this folder
3. Update documentation (CLAUDE.md, docs/thinking-memories.md)
4. Rename the actual folder

Let me mark the first few tasks as complete and start working on the folder rename.
