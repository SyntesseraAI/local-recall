## Thought

Now I understand the issue! The `marketplace.json` doesn't have a `dist_glob` pattern. When Claude Code fetches a plugin, it needs to know which files to download. Without a `dist_glob`, it likely defaults to a very limited pattern that doesn't include the `scripts/` directory.

Looking at the Claude Code plugin documentation and common patterns, the fix is to add a `dist_glob` pattern that includes the `scripts/` directory.

Let me search for what the correct format should be:

## Output

**Found the problem!** The `marketplace.json` is missing the `dist_glob` pattern. Without it, Claude Code doesn't know to include the `scripts/` directory when caching the plugin.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Claude Code Plugin Distribution:**
- The `dist_glob` field in `marketplace.json` tells Claude Code which files to download and cache
- Without it, only a minimal set of files gets cached (skills, config, manifest files)
- Scripts and MCP server files must be explicitly included in the glob pattern

Let me check the Claude Code plugin docs for the correct format:
