## Thought

The user wants me to:
1. Change the default for `episodicEnabled` from `false` to `true`
2. Combine the two UserPromptSubmit hooks (regular episodic and thinking) into one hook that conditionally calls either or both based on configuration

Let me first confirm the current state of the configuration and hooks by reading the relevant files.

## Output

Let me check the current configuration and hook setup first.
