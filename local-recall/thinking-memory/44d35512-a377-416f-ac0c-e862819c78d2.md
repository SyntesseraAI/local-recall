The test file tests the parsing logic but doesn't include tests for field name normalization. I should add tests for the normalization logic that I added.Also, I noticed the test file has a local `parseClaudeResponse` function that doesn't include the field normalization I added. I need to update the tests to include field normalization tests.Let me add new tests for the field normalization feature.
