## Thought

The user wants me to continue from where we left off. Based on the summary, I was in the middle of updating the JsonlStore to use 6-digit padding instead of 3-digit padding. Let me:

1. First read the current state of jsonl-store.ts to see what needs to be updated
2. Update the padding from 3 to 6 digits
3. Update EpisodicJsonlStore and ThinkingJsonlStore for the new multi-file API
4. Update tests
5. Commit and push

Let me start by reading the current jsonl-store.ts file.

## Output

Continuing with the multi-file JSONL storage implementation. I need to update the padding from 3 digits to 6 digits as requested. Let me first read the current state of the files.
