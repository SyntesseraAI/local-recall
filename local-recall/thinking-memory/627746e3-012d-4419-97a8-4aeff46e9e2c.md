## Thought

The memories directory exists but only has a `.gitkeep` file - no actual memory files. The user is correct that there are no memories stored yet.

I can either:
1. Help them create some initial memories using the MCP tools
2. Explain that the system is set up but no memories have been created yet

Let me provide a clear response about the current state.

## Output

You're right - the `local-recall/memories/` directory is empty (just has a `.gitkeep` placeholder). No memories have been created yet.

Would you like me to create some initial memories? For example, I could create a memory about this project's architecture and conventions based on the CLAUDE.md file. I can use the `memory_create` MCP tool to do this.
