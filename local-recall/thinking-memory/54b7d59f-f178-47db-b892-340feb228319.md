I have some TypeScript errors to fix:

1. The memory.ts and thinking-memory.ts files are calling getVectorStore/getThinkingVectorStore with a string (baseDir), but now they expect an options object
2. I imported withRetry and withRetrySync but didn't use them

Let me fix these issues. I'll update the memory.ts and thinking-memory.ts files to use the new options format, and remove the unused imports from vector-store.ts.
