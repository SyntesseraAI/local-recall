The user wants to spawn all transcripts at once and use a semaphore to control that we only have 10 running concurrently at any time. This is a more efficient approach than chunking because it keeps all 10 slots filled as processes complete.

I'll implement a simple semaphore pattern in the `processAllTranscripts` method.
