## Thought

Done! The local_cache files have been removed from the last 2 commits (note the commit hashes changed from badf71f → 0f4a7a0 and ea88f07 → 30290ea). The .gitignore has been updated to include `local_cache/`, but that change hasn't been committed yet.

The user can now:
1. Stage and commit the .gitignore change
2. Force push if needed (since the commit hashes changed)

Let me summarize what was done.

## Output

Done! I've removed `local_cache/` files from git history:

**Changes made:**
1. Added `local_cache/` to `.gitignore` (uncommitted change)
2. Rewrote the last 2 commits to exclude the `local_cache/` files:
   - `badf71f` → `0f4a7a0` 
   - `ea88f07` → `30290ea`

**Next steps:**
- Stage and commit the `.gitignore` change if you want to persist it
- When pushing, you'll need `git push --force-with-lease` since the commit hashes changed
