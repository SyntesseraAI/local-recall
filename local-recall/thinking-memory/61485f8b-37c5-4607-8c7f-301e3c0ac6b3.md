Now I understand. Looking at the hook code:

1. It extracts keywords from the prompt (line 86)
2. Searches for matching memories (lines 95-99)
3. If results are found, it outputs them to stdout (lines 109-120)
4. If NO results, it just exits with `process.exit(0)` (lines 101-104)

The problem is:
- When the hook runs and finds NO matches, it exits cleanly without outputting anything
- The "Success" message I'm seeing is likely from Claude Code's hook system indicating the hook ran successfully - not the hook's own output

So the hook IS running, but:
1. Either no memories match the keywords extracted from "stew"-related prompts
2. Or there's an issue with the search/index

Let me check the logs to see what's happening - or better, let me check if there's a memory with "stew" as an actual keyword. When we listed memories earlier, the one about stew had keywords: "search", "memory", "user", "conversations", "sausages" - notably NOT "stew"!

So the flow is:
1. User asks about stew
2. Hook extracts "stew" as a keyword
3. Hook searches for memories with "stew" keyword
4. No memories have "stew" as a keyword (the one mentioning stew only has "sausages" as a keyword)
5. Hook exits with no output
6. Claude Code shows "Success" because the hook ran without error

The user should create a memory with "stew" as an actual keyword for it to be found.

I should explain this to the user.
