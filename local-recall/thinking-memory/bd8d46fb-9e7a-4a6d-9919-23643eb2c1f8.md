## Thought

The user just said "hello!" - this is a simple greeting. According to my instructions, I should not use the todo list for simple, conversational tasks. I should just respond in a friendly but concise manner.

I should avoid using emojis unless the user explicitly requests them. I should keep my response short and concise since this is a CLI interface.

## Output

Hello! I'm Claude Code, ready to help you with your local-recall project. I can assist with development tasks, answer questions about the codebase, or help you work with the memory system.

What would you like to work on today?
