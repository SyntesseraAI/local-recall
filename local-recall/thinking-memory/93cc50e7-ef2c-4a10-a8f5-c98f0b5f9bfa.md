## Thought

Good, the build succeeded. The updated hook is now compiled. The user will need to test it on their next prompt to see if the JSON format injects context properly.

## Output

Done. The hook now outputs structured JSON:

```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "UserPromptSubmit",
    "additionalContext": "# Local Recall: Relevant Memories\n\n..."
  }
}
```

Try asking about stew again to test if the context injection works now.
