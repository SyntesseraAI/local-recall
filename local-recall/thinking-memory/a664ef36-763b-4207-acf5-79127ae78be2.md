## Thought

There are a lot of untracked files. I see:1. New source files (the JSONL stores and migration service)
2. A lot of memory files in local-recall/episodic-memory/ and local-recall/thinking-memory/

I should NOT commit the memory files - those are user data. I should only commit the source code changes. Let me add only the source files and tests.

## Output

I'll add only the source code changes (not the user memory files):
