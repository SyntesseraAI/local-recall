## Thought

Good, the build succeeded and the server.js is 1.1MB (bundled with dependencies). Now the user needs to reinstall the plugin in their other Claude instances.

When they reinstall, it will deploy to:
`~/.claude/plugins/cache/local-recall-marketplace/local-recall/0.1.1/`

And the new bundled server.js will be there.

## Output

Version bumped to **0.1.1** and rebuilt. The bundled server.js is 1.1MB (includes all dependencies).

**Next steps for other Claude instances:**

1. Uninstall the old plugin: `/plugins uninstall local-recall`
2. Reinstall from the marketplace (or local path)
3. Restart Claude Code

The new version will deploy to:
```
~/.claude/plugins/cache/local-recall-marketplace/local-recall/0.1.1/
```
