## Thought

The user wants to check if SQLite is running in serialized mode. SQLite has three threading modes:
1. Single-thread - no mutexes, not thread-safe
2. Multi-thread - safe for different connections in different threads, but not for the same connection
3. Serialized - fully thread-safe, all operations are serialized with mutexes

The threading mode can be checked with `PRAGMA compile_options` or `sqlite3_threadsafe()`. In better-sqlite3, we can check this by querying the database.

Let me look at how to check this and also see if better-sqlite3 or sqlite-vec has any specific threading requirements.

## Output

Let me check SQLite's threading mode. We can query it via pragma:
