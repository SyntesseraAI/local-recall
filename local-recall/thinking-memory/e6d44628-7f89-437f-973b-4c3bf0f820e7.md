Good, I can see that `ensureDir()` in `IndexManager` already creates the directories. I'll add .gitignore creation logic to this method. The .gitignore should exclude:
- index.json (the index cache)
- recall.log (the debug log)

I'll modify the `ensureDir` method to also create a .gitignore file if it doesn't exist.
