## Thought

Now I understand the current implementation. The `callClaudeCLI` method in `memory-extractor.ts` doesn't specify a model - it just uses the default. To test with Haiku, I need to:

1. Add a `--model haiku` argument to the Claude CLI call
2. Test it to ensure it works

Let me create a simple integration test to see if Haiku can handle the memory extraction prompt properly. I'll write a small test script that calls the Claude CLI with the Haiku model and a sample prompt.

First, let me check if there's a way to run a quick test. The easiest way would be to make a quick manual test with the Claude CLI.

## Output

Now I understand. The `callClaudeCLI` method (line 75-128) doesn't specify a model - it uses the default. Let me create a quick integration test to verify Haiku can handle the memory extraction task:
