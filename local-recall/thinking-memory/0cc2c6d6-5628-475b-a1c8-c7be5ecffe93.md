## Thought

I can see the contents of the types.ts file. Looking through it, I see standard JSDoc-style comments (the /** ... */ blocks) that document the various types and interfaces. These are regular TypeScript comments, not specifically GitHub Copilot comments.

There are no visible GitHub Copilot-specific comments in this file. The comments are just standard documentation comments that any developer or tool would write.

I should answer the user's question directly - I can see comments in the file, but they appear to be standard JSDoc comments, not GitHub Copilot-specific comments.

## Output

I can see the file [types.ts](src/core/types.ts), but I don't see any GitHub Copilot-specific comments in it. The file contains standard JSDoc-style comments (the `/** ... */` blocks) that document the types, interfaces, and schemas, but these appear to be regular documentation comments rather than anything specific to GitHub Copilot.

If you're expecting to see GitHub Copilot comments that aren't showing up, could you clarify what you're looking for? For example:
- Are you asking if I can see inline suggestions that Copilot might be making in your IDE?
- Are there specific comment markers or annotations you're wondering about?
- Did Copilot add comments that you want me to review or modify?
