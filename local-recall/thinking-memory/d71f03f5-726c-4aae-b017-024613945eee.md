## Thought

Done. Let me also update the episodic memory about the plugin version locations since that changed.

## Output

Done. Pushed commit `2ea801f` to `main`:

**refactor: Restructure to standard Claude Code marketplace plugin format**

- 35 files changed (+705/-23)
- `.claude-plugin/` now at root with `syntessera-marketplace` 
- `local-recall-plugin/` at root level
- Old `dev-marketplace/` structure removed
