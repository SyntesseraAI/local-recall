So the only memory about "stew" is from an earlier conversation where the user asked if there were any memories about sausages or stew - and at that time, the search found nothing. The memory just records that the question was asked, not any actual conversation about stew.

I should tell the user that we haven't actually discussed stew - there's just a memory of them previously asking about it, and the answer was that no stew-related memories existed.
