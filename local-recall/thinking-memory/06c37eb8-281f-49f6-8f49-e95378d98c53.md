## Thought

The user has provided a condensed transcript of a Claude Code session where the assistant was asked to:
1. Research Claude Plugins and the Rules system
2. Implement improvements to local-recall to better integrate with Claude's decision-making

The key findings and work completed were:
1. Research showed there is no formal "Rules system" - behavior is controlled through Skills, Settings files, CLAUDE.md, Hooks, and MCP tool descriptions
2. Created two new skills:
   - `check-memories/SKILL.md` - For searching memories on demand
   - `proactive-recall/SKILL.md` - For proactive memory recall before decisions
3. Updated MCP server tools description to improve clarity
4. Enhanced plugin.json with better description and keywords
5. Bumped version to 0.1.3
6. Ran tests to verify changes

Now I need to extract memories from this session that would be valuable for future work on this codebase.

Key memories to extract:
1. Claude Code doesn't have a formal "Rules system" - behavior is controlled through Skills, Settings, CLAUDE.md, Hooks, and MCP descriptions
2. Skills should be placed in `skills/` directory which is auto-discovered
3. Skills for local-recall should include check-memories and proactive-recall to help Claude make better decisions
4. MCP tool descriptions need to be clear and descriptive
5. Plugin discovery is improved through better descriptions and keywords in plugin.json
6. The plugin version should be bumped when adding new skills/tools

Let me create specific, actionable memories based on this session.
