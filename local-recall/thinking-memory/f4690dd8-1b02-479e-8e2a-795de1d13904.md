## Thought

The user has multiple Claude Code instances in different projects, and they're not seeing any transcript collection logs. This suggests the MCP server might not be starting or running properly in some instances.

Let me think about what could be happening:

1. Each project would have its own MCP server if configured
2. The MCP server writes to `local-recall/recall.log` in each project
3. If there are no `[transcript]` logs, the daemon might not be running

I should help them check:
1. Is the MCP server actually connected in the instances that aren't working?
2. Is there a `local-recall/recall.log` file being written?
3. Are there any MCP-related logs at all?

Let me look at the recall.log in the current project to see what logs are appearing and help diagnose.

## Output

Let me check the current recall.log to see what's being logged:
