  Now I understand the pattern. The folder name "memories" is defined in two
  core files: -...

Now I understand the pattern. The folder name "memories" is defined in two core files:
- `src/core/memory.ts` line 34: `this.memoriesDir = path.join(this.baseDir, 'memories');`
- `src/core/index.ts` line 30: `this.memoriesDir = path.join(this.baseDir, 'memories');`

Let me also check:
1. Test files that may reference this
2. Documentation files (CLAUDE.md and docs/)
3. The gitignore utility

I need to read more files to see if there are other references.
