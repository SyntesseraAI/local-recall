## Thought

Let me provide a summary of what was implemented.

## Output

Done! Here's what was implemented:

## User-Triggered Patterns
Detects when users explicitly ask to save something:
- "remember this/that"
- "save this for later"
- "don't forget"
- "note this down"
- "keep track of"
- "for future reference"
- "make a note"
- "store this in memory"
- "add this to your memory"

When triggered, it captures:
1. The assistant's response following the request
2. Any content the user provided after a colon (e.g., "remember this: always use ESM")
3. Quoted content in the user's message

## Smart Heuristics (Auto-Detection)
Detects valuable info in assistant responses:

| Category | Example Triggers |
|----------|------------------|
| **Architecture** | "the architecture uses...", "we chose X for Y", "chose X over Y because..." |
| **Bugfix** | "the bug was caused by...", "root cause was...", "this fails because...", "the fix was to..." |
| **Explanation** | "this works by...", "the way this works is..." |
| **Discovery** | "I found that...", "turns out that..." |
| **Convention** | "in this project we...", "the pattern here is..." |

User-triggered memories take priority over auto-detected ones when deduplicating.
