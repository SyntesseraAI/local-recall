## Thought

Both tasks are complete. Let me summarize what was done for the user.

## Output

Done! Here's a summary of the changes:

**1. Renamed `memories` folder to `episodic-memory`**

Updated in:
- `src/core/memory.ts:34` - folder path definition
- `src/core/index.ts:30` - folder path definition  
- `tests/unit/core/memory.test.ts:54` - test expectation
- `CLAUDE.md:51` - documentation
- `docs/mcp-server.md:235` - documentation
- `docs/architecture.md:44,181` - documentation

**2. Updated transcript sync to check both mtime AND size**

Modified `src/core/transcript-collector.ts:syncTranscripts()`:
- Now skips copying only if **both** mtime is current AND size matches
- If either has changed, the file is copied and will be automatically reprocessed via the content hash mechanism

The reprocessing flow already works correctly:
1. When a transcript is copied (due to mtime or size change)
2. `processTranscript()` computes the content hash
3. If hash differs from the processed-log entry, it:
   - Deletes old memories via `processedLog.getMemoryIds()`
   - Extracts new memories
   - Updates the processed-log with new hash and memory IDs

All 266 tests pass.
