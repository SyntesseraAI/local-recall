The user wants to validate how many thinking blocks should be in transcripts stored in `local-recall/transcripts`. They're asking how to find out the expected count.

Let me think about this:
1. The transcripts are likely JSON files from Claude Code sessions
2. Thinking blocks would be in the transcript JSON structure
3. I should look at what's in that directory and understand the transcript format

Let me first check what's in that directory and understand the structure.
