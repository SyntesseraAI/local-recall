## Thought

Looking at the test failures, I see the issue. The tests are expecting the MemoryManager to automatically add memories to the vector store, but looking at the test:

```typescript
// Create memory - automatically added to vector store
const memory = await memoryManager.createMemory({...});

// Search should find it via semantic similarity
const results = await searchEngine.search('database optimization');
```

The MemoryManager is supposed to also add to the vector store. Let me check how MemoryManager works and if it interacts with the vector store.

## Output

I see the issue - the tests expect `MemoryManager.createMemory()` to automatically add to the vector store. Let me check how that works:
