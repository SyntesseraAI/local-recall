I need to add documentation about the embedding model. The best places to add this information:

1. In CLAUDE.md - add a "Troubleshooting" section that mentions the model download and how to fix corrupted cache
2. Update the Setup section to mention that the first run will download the embedding model

Let me add a troubleshooting section to CLAUDE.md and update the setup instructions.
