I've updated the code. Now I need to remove the unused `createHash` import since I removed the hash-based approach. Let me check if it's still used elsewhere in the file.

Looking at the code, `createHash` is still used in `computeTranscriptHash` at the bottom of the file, so I should keep the import.

Let me build and test this to make sure it works.
