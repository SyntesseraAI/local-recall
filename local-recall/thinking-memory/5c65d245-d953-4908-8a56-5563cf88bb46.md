## Thought

The user is pointing out that the MCP server configuration in the plugin references `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/mcp-server/server.js`, and other Claude instances are failing to run it outside of the plugin repo.

Based on the memories injected, I can see this is a known issue:
1. The plugin deploys to `~/.claude/plugins/cache/local-recall-marketplace/local-recall/0.1.0/scripts/mcp-server/server.js`
2. Previously there was an issue with `--external:@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` which prevented bundling
3. The fix was to remove the `--external` flag so dependencies are bundled

Let me check the current state of things to understand what's happening now. The user seems to be asking about why other Claude instances are failing - this could be:
1. The bundled server.js isn't being deployed correctly
2. The plugin cache is out of date
3. Some other configuration issue

Let me look at the relevant files to understand the current situation.

## Output

Based on the memories from previous sessions, this is a known issue. The plugin deploys to `~/.claude/plugins/cache/local-recall-marketplace/local-recall/0.1.0/scripts/mcp-server/server.js` but the server needs all dependencies bundled since node_modules aren't shipped with the plugin.

Let me check the current state:
