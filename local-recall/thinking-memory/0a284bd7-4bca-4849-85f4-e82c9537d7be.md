  I can see the IndexManager is still being used in: - `src/mcp-server/tools.ts`
  - for...

I can see the IndexManager is still being used in:
- `src/mcp-server/tools.ts` - for `index_rebuild` tool
- `src/hooks/stop.ts` - for refreshing index after creating memories
- `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` - imports it
- Tests

The IndexManager provides keyword-based search (JSON file), while VectorStore provides semantic/vector search (SQLite). 

With the vector store now in place, the IndexManager seems redundant. The vector store already stores:
- Memory metadata (id, subject, keywords, applies_to, occurred_at, content_hash, content)
- Vector embeddings for semantic search

The index.json file that IndexManager creates/maintains is essentially redundant since we have memory.sqlite.

However, I should check search.ts to see how searching works and what's being used there.
