## Thought

I've updated the documentation with information about the embedding model and added a troubleshooting section. Let me summarize what was done.

## Output

Done. I've updated the documentation in three places:

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Added:
   - "Embedding Model" section under Development explaining the BGE-small-en-v1.5 model download
   - "Troubleshooting" section with the "Tokenizer file not found" error fix and explanation for slow first startup

2. **docs/architecture.md** - Added:
   - Vector Store and Embedding Service to the architecture diagram
   - Documentation for `VectorStore` and `EmbeddingService` components
   - Updated storage layer to include `memory.sqlite` and `local_cache/` directory

3. **.gitignore** - Added `local_cache/` to prevent committing the downloaded model files
