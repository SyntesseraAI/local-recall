## Thought

I can see the transcript collector. The key method is `syncTranscripts()` which copies transcripts from Claude's cache. Currently it only filters out synthetic transcripts. I need to add a check to also skip transcripts that don't contain thinking blocks.

The check for thinking should happen before we copy the file. Similar to how `isSyntheticFile()` checks the file content, I should add a method to check if a transcript contains thinking blocks.

Looking at the JSONL format, thinking blocks would be in assistant messages with a `thinking` field or similar. Let me check how thinking is structured in transcripts by looking at the thinking extractor.

## Output

Let me also look at the thinking extractor to understand how thinking blocks are detected in transcripts:
