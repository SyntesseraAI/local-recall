## Thought

Now I understand the transcript collector flow. The key methods are:

1. `findClaudeProjectDir()` - finds the Claude project directory
2. `listSourceTranscripts()` - lists transcripts in the Claude cache
3. `syncTranscripts()` - copies new/modified transcripts

The logging is already present but using `logger.transcript.debug()` which might not be visible. Let me check the logger configuration to understand log levels, then add more visible logging at the INFO level for when transcripts are being searched.

The issue is likely that:
1. The Claude projects directory doesn't exist yet
2. The expected folder name doesn't match
3. No transcripts exist yet in Claude's cache for this project

Let me add more detailed INFO-level logging that will help users understand what's happening when running in a new repo.

## Output

I can see the transcript collector already has debug-level logging, but those won't be visible by default. Let me add INFO-level logging to show the search process clearly. I'll also check the logger to understand the current log levels.
