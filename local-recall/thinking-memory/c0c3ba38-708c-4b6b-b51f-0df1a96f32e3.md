I see that both `memory.ts` and `index.ts` have `ensureDir()` methods that create the directories. I should add .gitignore creation in a centralized place. Let me check the index.ts to see if there's a better place, or I could create a utility function that's called from both.

Actually, looking at the project structure, the best approach would be to modify the `ensureDir` in the `IndexManager` (since it already creates the base directory) to also create the .gitignore file. Let me check index.ts more closely.
