## Thought

The compiled code DOES have the INFO-level logging. So the MCP server should be logging at INFO level. But the recall.log shows DEBUG-level logs with older message text. This means there must be an OLD MCP server process still running that was compiled before my changes.

The duplicate log entries also support this theory - there are TWO MCP servers running:
1. An old one (with DEBUG logging and old message format)
2. A new one (that might also be running, but its logs aren't visible because the old one is drowning them out)

Actually wait, looking at the duplicate entries again - each line appears EXACTLY twice. This could be:
1. Two separate MCP server processes writing to the same log file
2. A bug where the logging function is called twice

The user asked about multiple Claude Code instances - if they have multiple instances open for different projects, but the MCP server in one of them is pointing to THIS project's local-recall directory... that would explain the duplicates.

But actually, the more concerning issue is that the user says OTHER projects don't have transcript collection logs at all. That could mean:
1. Those projects don't have local-recall configured
2. The MCP server isn't starting for those projects
3. The MCP server is starting but writing logs somewhere else

Let me help the user understand what's happening. I should:
1. Point out the duplicate logs suggest two MCP servers for THIS project
2. Suggest checking if the MCP server is connected in the other projects
3. Suggest restarting Claude Code to pick up the new code

## Output

The compiled JS has the INFO logging, but the log shows older DEBUG-level messages. This means:

**There's an old MCP server process still running** (from before the logging changes). The duplicate entries confirm this - two servers writing to the same log.

For your other projects not showing transcript logs, it's likely one of:

1. **MCP server not configured** - Check if those projects have `local-recall` in `.claude/settings.json` under `mcpServers`
2. **MCP server not starting** - Run `/mcp` in those Claude instances to check status
3. **Different log location** - Each project's MCP server writes to its own `local-recall/recall.log`

**To fix the stale server issue here:**

```bash
# Find and kill old MCP server processes
pkill -f "local-recall/dist/mcp-server/server.js"
```

Then restart Claude Code to spawn fresh MCP servers.

For other projects, can you run `/mcp` in one of them and tell me if `local-recall` shows as connected?
