## Thought

All of them are duplicates! So all instances of "multiple thinking blocks" in the transcripts are actually streaming artifacts where the same thinking block is recorded twice.This means:1. **True interleaved thinking** (different thoughts interleaved with output) doesn't appear in these transcripts2. The "multiple thinking blocks" are actually **duplicates** caused by streaming artifacts3. The current code will join these duplicates, creating redundant thinking content in memoriesThis is something we could potentially fix by deduplicating thinking blocks before storing them. Want me to suggest this improvement?

## Output

**Findings:**

All 7 messages with "multiple thinking blocks" are actually **streaming artifacts** - the same thinking block recorded twice, not true interleaved thinking.

**Current behavior issue:** The code joins duplicate thinking blocks, creating redundant content in memories:
```
"Same thought...\nSame thought..."
```

**Recommendation:** We should deduplicate thinking blocks before joining. Here's a simple fix:
