## Thought

The user is asking if the documentation is updated. Let me check the current state of the documentation in the `docs/` folder and compare it with the codebase to see if everything is in sync.

Let me first look at what documentation exists and then compare it with the current implementation.

## Output

Let me check the current state of the documentation.
