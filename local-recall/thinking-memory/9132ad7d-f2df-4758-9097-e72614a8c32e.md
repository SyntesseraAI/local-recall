## Thought

The user just said "test". This appears to be a simple test message, possibly to check if the system is working or to see if the hooks are functioning properly.

Looking at the system reminders, I can see:
1. SessionStart hook succeeded
2. UserPromptSubmit hook succeeded
3. There are relevant memories being injected into context

The memories show information about the local-recall project - test suite details, vector search scoring, transcript handling, etc.

I should respond briefly to acknowledge the test works. I can confirm that I'm receiving the hook context and memories.

## Output

Working. I can see the Local Recall hooks are functioning - both SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit executed successfully. I'm receiving 7 episodic memories and 7 thinking memories in my context related to your previous work on this project (test suite, vector search scoring, transcript handling, etc.).
