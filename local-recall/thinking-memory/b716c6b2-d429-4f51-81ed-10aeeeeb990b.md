## Thought

The tarball appears to be corrupted or truncated. The fastembed library downloads the model on first use, so it looks like the download was incomplete. Let me check if there's a way to re-download the model files, or if we should just delete the corrupted cache and let fastembed re-download on next use.

Looking at the fastembed documentation, when FlagEmbedding.init is called, it downloads the model to a local cache directory. The default location varies, but it seems like this project may have configured it to use `local_cache/`.

Let me check if there's any configuration for the fastembed cache location, or we should just delete the corrupted files and let it re-download.

## Output

The tarball is corrupted/truncated. The model download was incomplete. Let me remove the corrupted cache so fastembed can re-download the model:
