## Thought

All tasks completed. Let me provide a summary to the user:

## Output

Done. Here's what was cleaned up:

**Removed stale files:**
- `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/user-prompt-submit-thinking.js` - old hook that tried to use `better-sqlite3`

**Updated:**
- `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/config/hooks.json` - now points to `user-prompt-submit.js` instead of the deleted `user-prompt-submit-thinking.js`

**Rebuilt:**
- All plugin scripts rebuilt with current source (using Orama instead of SQLite)

The deleted files from git status (`src/mcp-server/http-server.ts`, `src/utils/daemon-client.ts`, `src/utils/database.ts`) were already removed from the filesystem - those deletions just need to be committed when you're ready.
