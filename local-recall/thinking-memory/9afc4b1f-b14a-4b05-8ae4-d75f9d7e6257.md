## Thought

The user is asking about whether thinking memory extraction runs in parallel to episodic memory extraction. Let me search the codebase to understand how these two processes work and whether they run concurrently.

## Output

Let me search the codebase to understand how thinking memory extraction and episodic memory extraction are orchestrated.
