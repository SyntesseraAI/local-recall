The user is asking about the SessionStart hook behavior - specifically whether it reloads all memories from scratch or does an incremental/delta update.

Let me check the relevant code to answer this accurately. Based on the memories provided in the system reminder, I can see that:

1. "The SessionStart hook loads the memory index from disk (`local-recall/index.json`) once at the beginning of a Claude Code session. This index remains static throughout the entire session and is never refreshed or updated."

But I should verify this by looking at the actual code to give an accurate answer.
