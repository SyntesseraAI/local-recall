## Thought

The MCP server is failing to start. The path shows it's using the plugin version from the marketplace cache:
`/Users/joe/.claude/plugins/cache/local-recall-marketplace/local-recall/0.1.0/scripts/mcp-server/server.js`

This is different from the local development version at `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/dist/mcp-server/server.js`.

The issue is likely:
1. The plugin version is outdated (0.1.0)
2. The path uses `scripts/` but the current build outputs to `dist/`
3. The server file might not exist at that path

Let me check if that file exists and what error is occurring.

## Output

The MCP server is **failing** and using the **plugin cache** version, not your local dev version:

```
/Users/joe/.claude/plugins/cache/local-recall-marketplace/local-recall/0.1.0/scripts/mcp-server/server.js
```

Note: it's looking in `scripts/` but your build outputs to `dist/`. Let me check what's at that path:
