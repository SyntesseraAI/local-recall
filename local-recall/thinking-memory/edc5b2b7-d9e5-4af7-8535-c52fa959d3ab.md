## Thought

The hook looks correct - it uses the DaemonClient to make HTTP requests to the daemon, and doesn't load sqlite-vec directly. Let me check the DaemonClient to see if there's an issue there.

## Output

The hook looks correct - it uses HTTP calls to the daemon. Let me check the daemon client and the HTTP server to see if there's any issue with how the requests are being handled.
