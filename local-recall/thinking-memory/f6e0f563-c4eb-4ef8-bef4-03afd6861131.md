## Thought

The user wants to use fastembed-js instead of @xenova/transformers. Let me check what fastembed-js offers and update accordingly. It seems there is a JavaScript version of fastembed after all. Let me look into it and update the implementation.

## Output

Let me switch to `fastembed`. I'll uninstall transformers and use fastembed-js instead.
