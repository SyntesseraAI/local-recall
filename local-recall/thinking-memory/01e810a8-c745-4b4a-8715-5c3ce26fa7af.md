The `extractKeywordsFromText` function is used in:
1. src/index.ts - exported
2. src/utils/transcript.ts - used for creating memories from transcripts
3. tests/unit/utils/markdown.test.ts - tests

Since transcript.ts still uses this for keyword extraction when creating memories from transcripts, I have a choice:
1. Keep the keyword-extractor package (but it was removed)
2. Implement a simple keyword extraction without the dependency

Actually, the plan said we're using vector search now, but we still need keywords for the memory format. Let me think about this...

The memory format has a `keywords` field, and they're still used in the memory metadata. Even though search is vector-based now, the keywords are part of the memory schema. So I need to provide a keyword extraction function.

I have two options:
1. Re-install keyword-extractor
2. Implement a simple keyword extraction without the dependency

Let me implement a simple keyword extraction that doesn't require an external dependency. This is better for the bundling anyway.
