## Thought

Okay, the bundled hooks in `local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/` were updated on Dec 20 at 22:36, which is recent. They're 626KB each - bundled with all dependencies.

The hooks are working when I run them manually. But users report they're not triggering. 

Let me think about what could be happening:

1. **The hooks require certain environment variables or inputs** - The hooks expect JSON input via stdin, and they derive the `cwd` from it
2. **Plugin installation location** - Users install the plugin, and it ends up somewhere in `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`3. **The `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` variable** - The hooks.json uses this variable, but does Claude Code actually expand it?
4. **Users might not have installed or updated the plugin** - They could have an old cached version

Let me check:
1. How the plugin gets installed/distributed
2. What happens when users install the plugin
3. If there's a marketplace or installation mechanism

Actually, looking at the code more carefully, I notice this is a marketplace plugin. Let me check if the user's installed plugin is up-to-date vs what's in this repo.

## Output

The bundled hooks are recent (Dec 20). Let me check where installed plugins actually live and if there's a version mismatch:
