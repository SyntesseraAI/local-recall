This works! So the memory data is fine, the embedding generation is fine, the insert is fine, and vector search works when we use the actual memory data.The issue must be somewhere in how we're either:1. Loading from the persisted index (but we tested that and it worked in isolation)
2. Something in our VectorStore class that's different

Let me test the actual VectorStore class to see where it breaks.

## Output

This works with actual memory data! Let me trace through our VectorStore class to find the issue:
