  Now I see the issue. Looking at the example message the user provided: ```json
  { "message": {...

## Thought

Now I see the issue. Looking at the example message the user provided:

```json
{
  "message": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "thinking",
        "thinking": "Now I need to update the transcript.ts file to...",
        "signature": "..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The actual transcript format from Claude Code has:
- `message.content` as an **array** of content blocks
- Each block has a `type` field (like `"thinking"` or `"text"`)
- Thinking blocks have a `thinking` field with the actual text

But the current code expects:
- `content` to be a **string** (line 21-23)
- An optional `thinking` field at the root level (line 29)

This is a mismatch. The code needs to be updated to:
1. Parse `message.content` as an array of content blocks
2. Extract thinking from blocks with `type: "thinking"`
3. Extract text content from blocks with `type: "text"`

Let me also check the types.ts to see the current TranscriptMessage type definition.

## Output

I see the issue. The current code expects a flat structure with `content` as a string, but the actual transcript format has `content` as an **array of content blocks**. Let me check the types too:
