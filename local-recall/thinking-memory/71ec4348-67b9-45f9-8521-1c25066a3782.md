## Thought

Looking at the thinking extractor code, I can see that it does NOT filter thinking blocks at all. The `extractThinkingFromBlocks` function at line 41-46 simply extracts all thinking content from blocks and joins them. The `parseTranscriptForThinking` function at line 63-97 collects ALL thinking blocks from assistant messages.

Now let me update the hooks to use readonly mode for their search operations. Let me read the hooks first.

Now let me update the hooks to use readonly mode:
