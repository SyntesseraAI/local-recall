## Thought

Interesting findings:

1. `.mcp.json` doesn't exist at the project root
2. The `scripts/mcp-server/` directory doesn't exist (the bundled output)
3. But there IS a running process (PID 4524) that matches "mcp-server/server.js"

Let me check:
1. Where the MCP configuration might be (maybe in a different location)
2. What that running process actually is
3. If the build has been run to create the scripts directory

## Output

Interesting - there's a process running but some files are missing. Let me dig deeper.
