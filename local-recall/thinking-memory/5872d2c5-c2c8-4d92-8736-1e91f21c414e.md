## Thought

The MCP search is working. It found 3 results:
1. 61% similarity - Vector store initialization (old sqlite-vec reference)
2. 60% similarity - Orama pure JavaScript architecture 
3. 59% similarity - User-prompt-submit hook

All above the 50% threshold. The search is working correctly via MCP.

The issue is that the hooks aren't injecting memories into my context because:
1. My session's UserPromptSubmit hook was triggered at startup with what it detected as an internal prompt
2. Subsequent prompts may not be triggering the hook properly

But the MCP tools work, and the Orama search is functional. The 50% threshold change is now in effect.

Let me clean up the todo list since we're done.

## Output

Orama search is working. Found 3 results all above 50% threshold:
- 61%: Vector store initialization  
- 60%: Orama pure JavaScript architecture
- 59%: User-prompt-submit hook

The search via MCP tools works correctly. The hooks may not be injecting memories into context due to how Claude Code handles certain sessions, but the underlying Orama implementation is functional.

Summary of what was done:
1. **Removed HTTP server references** from docs (no longer needed with Orama)
2. **Lowered similarity threshold** from 80% to 50% 
3. **All tests pass** (288 pass, 1 skipped for known concurrency bug)
4. **Orama search verified** working via MCP tools
