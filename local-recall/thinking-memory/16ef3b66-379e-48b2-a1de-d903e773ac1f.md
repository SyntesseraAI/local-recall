Good, that fixes the gitignore issue. Now I need to address the SessionStart hook timeout. The hook is doing too much heavy work - initializing the vector store (which downloads a 133MB model on first use) and syncing all memories.

The fix should make the session-start hook lightweight by skipping the vector store initialization. The vector store can be initialized lazily by the MCP server or user-prompt-submit hook instead.

Let me update the session-start hook to not initialize the vector store.
