Build successful. Let me summarize the current state:

1. Episodic memory processing is restored in the MCP daemon
2. Debug logging added for memory searches in both hooks
3. The defaults are already correct:
   - `episodicEnabled` defaults to `false` (disabled by default)
   - `thinkingEnabled` defaults to `true` (enabled by default)

So the user's request is effectively complete. The daemon will only process episodic memories if the env var `LOCAL_RECALL_EPISODIC_ENABLED=true` is explicitly set.
