## Thought

Perfect! Looking at line 29-50 of the log, I can see:

```
[2025-11-29T23:53:53.782Z] [INFO] [hooks] Stop hook fired
[2025-11-29T23:53:53.785Z] [INFO] [hooks] Stop hook input received: {
  ...
}
[2025-11-29T23:53:53.789Z] [INFO] [hooks] Stop hook: Found 9 potential memories
[2025-11-29T23:53:53.792Z] [INFO] [memory] Created memory e4bfc963-c6a1-45be-a8c2-1128f9ab456b: "The user is asking why memories are not being created..."
...
[2025-11-29T23:53:53.805Z] [INFO] [hooks] Stop hook completed: Created 9 new memories
```

So YES! The Stop hook IS working now! It fired after the previous conversation and created 9 memories. This is great!

The user is right - it seems like it IS working now. Those loaded memories at the start of this session were created by the Stop hook firing at the end of the previous session.

So the system is now fully functional:
- ✅ SessionStart hook works
- ✅ UserPromptSubmit hook works
- ✅ Stop hook works (creating memories)
- ✅ MCP server works

Everything is working! The user was right to correct me. Now the question is "what now?" - meaning what should we do next with this working system?

## Output

You're absolutely right! 🎉

Looking at the log (line 29-50), the Stop hook **DID fire** and created 9 memories from our previous conversation:

```
[2025-11-29T23:53:53.782Z] Stop hook fired
[2025-11-29T23:53:53.789Z] Stop hook: Found 9 potential memories
[2025-11-29T23:53:53.805Z] Stop hook completed: Created 9 new memories
```

## The system is fully working! ✅

All three hooks are functioning:
- ✅ **SessionStart** - loads memories at the start (8 memories loaded)
- ✅ **UserPromptSubmit** - searches for relevant memories (found 5 for this prompt)
- ✅ **Stop** - creates new memories when conversations end

The memories you saw at the beginning of this session were created by the Stop hook from the previous session. So the entire memory lifecycle is working in VS Code!

## What now?

Now that everything's working, you can:

1. **Just use it naturally** - memories will be created and recalled automatically as you work
2. **Test the quality** - see if the memories being created are useful and relevant
3. **Tune the system** - adjust keyword extraction, memory parsing, or search relevance if needed
4. **Use MCP tools** - manually create/edit important memories with `memory_create`
5. **Update those incorrect memories** - we have 9 memories saying the Stop hook doesn't work, when it clearly does! 😄

Want me to clean up those outdated memories that incorrectly claim the Stop hook isn't working?
