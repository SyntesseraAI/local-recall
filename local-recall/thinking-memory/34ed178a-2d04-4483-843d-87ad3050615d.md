## Thought

Looking at the defaults:
- `episodicEnabled` defaults to `false` 
- `thinkingEnabled` defaults to `true`

The user mentioned they wanted to remove an env var from the MCP server config. Since `episodicEnabled` defaults to `false`, if we don't set the env var it will be disabled. The thinking memory files suggest that `LOCAL_RECALL_EPISODIC_ENABLED=true` was being set somewhere to enable it.

Since the .claude/settings.json doesn't exist in this project directory, and the CLAUDE.md documentation shows example configurations, I should check if the user has one configured elsewhere or if they want me to update the documentation to not include this env var.

Let me check the documentation to see if we have `LOCAL_RECALL_EPISODIC_ENABLED` mentioned as an env var to set.

## Output

Let me check the CLAUDE.md and docs for MCP configuration with env vars:
