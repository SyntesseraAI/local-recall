Good, I've added diagnostic logging. Now let me rebuild and also think about what could cause the issue.

The error message shows that memories[0].subject, memories[0].keywords, etc. are all undefined. This means:
1. The `memories` array exists
2. There are at least 4 items in the array
3. But each item doesn't have the expected fields

Possible causes:
1. Claude returned objects with different field names like `title`, `tags`, `scope`, `body` instead of `subject`, `keywords`, `applies_to`, `content`
2. Claude returned nested objects
3. The `--output-format json` wrapping is adding another level

Let me add field name normalization to handle common variations. But first, let me build and test to see the actual raw response.

Actually, I should also make sure we handle the common case where Claude might use slightly different field names. Let me add a normalization step.
