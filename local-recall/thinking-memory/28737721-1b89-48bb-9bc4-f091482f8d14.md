The user wants to remove episodic memory processing from the MCP daemon. Looking at the code:1. The daemon runs both episodic and thinking processing2. The episodic processing is controlled by `config.episodicEnabled`

I should remove the episodic processing entirely from the daemon loop, including:
- `runDaemonProcessing()` calls - episodic transcript processing
- `runVectorSync()` calls - episodic vector sync
- The related functions and flags

I'll also need to clean up the imports since we won't need the episodic memory extractor anymore.
