## Thought

The user is asking about whether the transcript copying/syncing process checks if transcripts are synthetic before copying them. Based on the thinking memories injected, I can see there was previous work investigating synthetic transcripts (those with `<synthetic>` model field) and whether they should be filtered out.

Let me check the transcript-collector.ts to see the current implementation of how transcripts are synced.

## Output

Let me check the transcript collector to see if it filters synthetic transcripts during the sync process.
