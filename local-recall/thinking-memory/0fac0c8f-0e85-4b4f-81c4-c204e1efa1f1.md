## Thought

The user is asking about the SessionStart hook behavior. They want it to retrieve the most recent memories to allow sessions to continue with context. Let me check the current implementation to understand what it does and if there's an issue.

Looking at the CLAUDE.md documentation, it says:
- SessionStart Hook: "Reads the 5 most recent memories directly from files (sorted by `occurred_at`)"

And from the memories injected:
- "Session-start hook simplified to use file-based MemoryManager" - it "calls `listMemories()` to get recent memories without semantic search"
- "SessionStart hook performs full reload of all memories, not delta" - it "creates a fresh MemoryManager instance, loads all memories via `listMemories()`, and then selects the 5 most recent memories sorted by `occurred_at` timestamp"

So it seems like the session-start hook is already designed to retrieve recent memories. Let me read the actual implementation to see if there's an issue or if the user wants some specific enhancement.

## Output

Let me check the current session-start hook implementation to understand what it does now and what might need to be changed.
