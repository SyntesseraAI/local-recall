## Thought

The summarize.ts is only imported in its test file. Looking at transcript.ts, it has its own local `generateSubject` function that doesn't use ts-textrank. 

So to simplify:1. Replace the `summarize.ts` `generateSubject` function with a simple implementation
2. Remove the ts-textrank dependency from package.json
3. Update tests if needed

Let me simplify the summarize.ts file by replacing the ts-textrank logic with simple "take text up to first period" logic.

## Output

The summarize.ts is only used by tests. Let me simplify it by removing the ts-textrank dependency:
