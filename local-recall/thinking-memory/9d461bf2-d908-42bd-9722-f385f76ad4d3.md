## Thought

The user is asking about the thinking memory storage files. They have both `thinking.jsonl` and `thinking-000001.jsonl` files and are wondering if `thinking.jsonl` should exist.

Let me look at the recent git commits to understand the storage format. The most recent commit mentions "Migrate memory storage to JSONL format with multi-file support" and another mentions "implement multi-file JSONL storage with 6-digit padding".

This suggests the storage was migrated to use numbered JSONL files (like `thinking-000001.jsonl`). The plain `thinking.jsonl` might be a leftover from a previous storage format before the migration.

Let me check the codebase to understand the current storage implementation.

## Output

Let me check the current storage implementation to understand whether `thinking.jsonl` is expected.
