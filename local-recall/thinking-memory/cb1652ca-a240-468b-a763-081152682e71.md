## Thought

The user is saying that since insights are already part of the text output (they're styled text within text blocks), we should just leave them as-is. The insights will naturally be captured in the `## Output` section since they're part of the assistant's text response.

So no code changes needed - the current implementation already captures insights as part of the output text.

## Output

Makes sense. Since insights are just styled text within the `text` content blocks, they're already captured in the `## Output` section of thinking memories. No changes needed - the current extraction already includes them.
