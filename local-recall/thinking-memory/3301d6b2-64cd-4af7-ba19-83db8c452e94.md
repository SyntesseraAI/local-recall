## Thought

Now there are more errors. Let me analyze them:

1. `Ollama embed failed: 500` - Transient, already addressed

2. `Failed to parse Claude response: Unterminated string in JSON` - This suggests the memory extractor is calling Claude to extract memories, but the response is getting truncated or malformed JSON.

3. `Failed to parse Claude response: Unexpected token '\'` - Same issue, malformed JSON from Claude's response.

4. `content.toLowerCase is not a function` - This is a code bug! Something is passing a non-string value to `.toLowerCase()`. The `content` variable is expected to be a string but it's something else (maybe undefined, null, or an object).

The last error is happening in the extractor when processing transcripts. Let me look at the code to find where this `.toLowerCase()` call is happening.

## Output

There are a few different issues here. The `content.toLowerCase is not a function` error is a bug - something is passing a non-string to `.toLowerCase()`. Let me find where that's happening:
