The user is asking if I'm seeing memories. Let me check what memories are available by searching or listing them. I should use the MCP tools that are available to me.

Looking at the available tools, I can see:
- mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__memory_search
- mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__memory_list
- mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__memory_get
- mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__memory_create
- mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__index_rebuild

The user is asking if I'm seeing memories, so I should check if there are any memories loaded or available. Let me list the memories to see what's there.
