## Thought

The user is asking about making a decision on what to do next with the local-recall project. I should understand the current state of the project and what options might be available. Let me look at what's been done recently and what might be pending.

Looking at the git status:
- Current branch: claude/create-claude-md-01PPHDFfpxRruDbNfybJi4Y4
- Some files have been deleted or modified in dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/.claude-plugin/
- Recent commits show work on package-lock.json, PR feedback, keyword extraction, and installation instructions

I should ask the user what decisions they're considering or explore the codebase to understand what's in progress. Since this is an open-ended question, I should ask for clarification about what kind of decision they're referring to.

## Output

What kind of decision are you thinking about? Are you looking at:

1. **Next feature to implement** - what functionality to add to local-recall
2. **Architecture/design decisions** - how something should be structured
3. **PR/branch decisions** - what to do with the current branch or pending changes
4. **Something else**

Let me know what's on your mind and I can help you think through the options.
