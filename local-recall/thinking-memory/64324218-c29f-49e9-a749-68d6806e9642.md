## Thought

The user is right - the HTTP server was removed since Orama is pure JavaScript and doesn't need the mutex workarounds that sqlite-vec required. The hooks now call Orama directly.

However, I notice every UserPromptSubmit is being skipped as "internal prompt". Let me check why - the condition is `input.prompt.includes("[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]")`. Maybe the prompt field contains something unexpected?

But the more pressing task is to update the docs to remove references to the HTTP server. Let me do that.

## Output

You're right - the HTTP server is obsolete now that Orama handles everything in pure JavaScript. Let me update the docs. Also, I notice every prompt is being skipped as "internal" - I should investigate that after updating the docs.
