## Thought

No `node_modules` directory in the plugin cache. The plugin was deployed without bundling its dependencies. This is a critical issue - the MCP server can't start without its dependencies.Options to fix:

## Output

No `node_modules` in the plugin cache - the MCP server was deployed without bundled dependencies.

The plugin needs its dependencies **bundled** into the server.js file. Let me check the local plugin config:
