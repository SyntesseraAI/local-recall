## Thought

The session-start hook uses the daemon client to get recent memories, and falls back to the file-based MemoryManager. Since MemoryManager doesn't use sqlite-vec, the fallback is already safe. I can simplify this hook to just use the file-based approach directly since it's already safe. However, to be consistent with the other hook, let me update it to use the SearchEngine directly for semantic search if needed, or just use the MemoryManager for recent memories.

Actually, looking at it more closely, the session-start hook just needs recent memories sorted by date - it doesn't need semantic search. So the file-based approach (MemoryManager) is sufficient and doesn't need sqlite-vec at all. Let me simplify this hook to just use MemoryManager directly without the daemon client.

## Output

The session-start hook can be simplified to just use the file-based MemoryManager since it only needs recent memories (no semantic search). Let me update it:
