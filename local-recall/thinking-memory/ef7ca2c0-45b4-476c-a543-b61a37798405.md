## Thought

I see - both search engines use separate vector stores:
- `SearchEngine` uses `getVectorStore()`
- `ThinkingSearchEngine` uses `getThinkingVectorStore()`

Let me check these two vector store implementations to see if they could be causing the mutex issue by creating separate database connections.

## Output

Both search engines use separate vector stores. Let me check how these are initialized and if they share the same database connection.
