## Thought

The user is asking me to extract memories from a transcript about fixing MCP server startup issues. Let me analyze what was learned, what was discovered, and what specific knowledge about this codebase was gained.

From the transcript:
1. The user asked about MCP server failing to start
2. The assistant investigated by:
   - Checking logs (recall.log)
   - Attempting to start the server
   - Reading package.json
   - Checking dist/mcp-server directory
   - Reading the server.ts source
   - Checking MCP SDK version

However, the transcript is quite sparse - there are tool invocations but the actual results aren't fully captured (many say "OK" or "Completed" with no details, and some timeouts occurred). This is a condensed transcript format.

What can I extract:
1. The MCP server startup was failing - this is a known issue
2. The server is at src/mcp-server/server.ts
3. The server uses @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
4. There's a dist/mcp-server built directory
5. Logs are written to local-recall/recall.log

What I DON'T have enough information about:
- What the actual error was (the transcript shows timeout for the key results)
- What the fix was (this appears to be an investigation, not a complete resolution)
- What specifically changed that broke it

Given the sparse nature of the transcript and that it shows investigations but not complete results or solutions, I should extract what was learned about the server structure and the fact that there was a startup issue, but I cannot extract specific technical solutions since they're not fully shown.

However, let me be careful here. The transcript shows:
- An MCP server startup issue existed
- The investigation path taken
- But the actual error messages and fixes aren't captured in the condensed form

I should extract memories about:
1. The MCP server location and structure (src/mcp-server/server.ts)
2. The investigation approach for server issues


3. The fact that the server needs to be built (dist/mcp-server)
4. The dependency on @modelcontextprotocol/sdk

I'll focus on the build process and SDK dependency. The project requires a compiled version of the MCP server in the dist/mcp-server directory, indicating a build step is necessary before running. The @modelcontextprotocol/sdk is a critical dependency for the server's functionality, suggesting it provides core infrastructure for the server's operations.

The server can be launched directly using `node ./dist/mcp-server/server.js`, with logs captured in local-recall/recall.log. While the transcript shows incomplete investigation details, the structural insights reveal a clear server setup pattern involving compilation, SDK integration, and logging mechanisms.

I'm identifying key structural elements: server location, compilation requirements, and basic runtime configuration. The investigation hints at a modular approach to server deployment, with distinct source and distribution directories.
