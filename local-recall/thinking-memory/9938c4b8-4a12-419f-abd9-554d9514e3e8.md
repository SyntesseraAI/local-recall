## Thought

Now I understand. Insights in explanatory mode are **not** a separate content block type - they're formatted text within regular `text` blocks. The format is:

```
`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**The Problem:** ...
**Plugin Commands Must Be Self-Contained:** ...
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
```

So they're delimited by backtick lines with `★ Insight` and a closing line of dashes.This means to capture insights for thinking memories, we need to:
1. Parse text blocks in assistant messages
2. Look for the `★ Insight` pattern
3. Extract the content between the opening and closing delimiter
4. Add that as a separate section in the thinking memory (alongside Thought and Output)

The user wants to capture these insights as part of thinking memories. Currently the format is:
```markdown
## Thought
{thinking block content}

## Output
{text block content}
```

We could modify it to:
```markdown
## Thought
{thinking block content}

## Insight
{insight content if present}

## Output
{text block content}
```

Or perhaps include insights as part of the output since they're shown to the user.

Let me propose the implementation to the user.

## Output

Now I understand the format. Insights are **styled text within regular `text` blocks**, not a separate content block type:

```
`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**The Problem:** ...
**Plugin Commands Must Be Self-Contained:** ...
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
```

To capture these for thinking memories, we need to:

1. Parse `text` content blocks
2. Look for the `★ Insight` pattern (with the backtick delimiters)
3. Extract the insight content
4. Add it to the thinking memory format

**Current format:**
```markdown
## Thought
{thinking}

## Output
{text output}
```

**Proposed format with insights:**
```markdown
## Thought
{thinking}

## Insight
{insight content - if present}

## Output
{text output}
```

Should I implement this in `thinking-extractor.ts`? The changes would be:
1. Add an `extractInsightsFromText()` function to detect and extract insight blocks
2. Modify `parseTranscriptForThinking()` to capture insights alongside thinking/text
3. Update the combined content format to include the `## Insight` section
