## Thought

The user is showing me an error from the memory extractor. It looks like there's a Zod validation error where the code expected an object but received an array. Let me look at the memory-extractor.ts file to understand what's happening.

## Output

I see an error where the memory extractor is receiving an array when it expects an object. Let me investigate the memory extractor code to understand the issue.
