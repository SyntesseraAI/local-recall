## Thought

Very interesting! When we search with the EXACT same embedding as the document, we get results. But when we search with a different embedding (the query embedding), we get 0 results even though they should be semantically similar.

This could be a threshold issue - Orama might have a minimum similarity threshold that our embeddings aren't meeting.

Let me check what the actual cosine similarity is between the doc and query embeddings.

## Output

Searching with the exact embedding works, but different embeddings return 0. Let me check the similarity:
