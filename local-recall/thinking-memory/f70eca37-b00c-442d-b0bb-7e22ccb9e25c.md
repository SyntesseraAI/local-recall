AHA! I found the problem!

Looking at the two hooks:

**SessionStart hook** (lines 88-108):
- Outputs plain text directly to stdout with `console.log()`
- Format: "# Local Recall: Loaded Memories"
- Plain markdown output

**UserPromptSubmit hook** (lines 126-134):
- Outputs structured JSON with `hookSpecificOutput` and `additionalContext`
- Format: `{ "hookSpecificOutput": { "hookEventName": "UserPromptSubmit", "additionalContext": "..." } }`

These two hooks have **different output formats**! The UserPromptSubmit hook is using the correct format for Claude Code hooks (structured JSON), but the SessionStart hook is using plain text output.

According to Claude Code's hook documentation, hooks should output their context as JSON with a specific structure. The SessionStart hook needs to be updated to match the UserPromptSubmit format.

Let me verify this is indeed the issue and propose a fix.
