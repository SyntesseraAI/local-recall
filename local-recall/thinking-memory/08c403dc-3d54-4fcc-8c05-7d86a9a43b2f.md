## Thought

Build successful. Now the hook uses a `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` token at the start of the prompt, and checks for that token to prevent recursion. This way the user can test with different extraction prompts without accidentally triggering the recursion guard.

## Output

Done. Now the hook uses `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` token at the start of the prompt:

- Internal calls prefix the prompt with `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]`
- The recursion guard checks for `startsWith('[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]')` 

This way you can test with prompts containing "Extract keywords..." without triggering the guard.
