The user wants two changes:
1. Remove user messages from being saved - only save assistant messages
2. Agent/assistant memories should only be saved if they are multi-line

I need to modify the code in `src/utils/transcript.ts` in the `analyzeForMemories` function to:
1. Filter out user messages (only keep assistant messages)
2. Only save assistant messages if they have multiple lines

Let me make these changes.
