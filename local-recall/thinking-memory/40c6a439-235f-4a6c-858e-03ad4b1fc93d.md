  Now let me rewrite the `analyzeForMemories` function with the new approach.
  I'll structure it as:...

Now let me rewrite the `analyzeForMemories` function with the new approach. I'll structure it as:

1. **User-triggered memories** - Look for explicit user requests to remember something
2. **Smart heuristics** - Improved automatic detection

I'll also need to handle the context properly - when a user says "remember this", I need to capture the relevant assistant response or the context being discussed.
