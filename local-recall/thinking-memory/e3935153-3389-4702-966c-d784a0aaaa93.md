## Thought

Now I understand the vector stores. They currently:
1. Generate embeddings on-the-fly when `add()` is called
2. Store embeddings in the Orama index

The plan calls for:
1. `addWithEmbedding(memory, embedding)` - Use pre-computed embedding from JSONL
2. `getEmbedding(id)` - Return embedding for a memory
3. Modify `sync()` to read embeddings from JSONL first

Let me also check the JSONL stores to see how embeddings are stored/retrieved:

## Output

Let me also check how embeddings are stored in the JSONL stores:
