Now I can see the problem from the debug logs:

```
[2025-11-30T14:49:07.294Z] [DEBUG] [transcript] Checking path: /Users/joe/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall
[2025-11-30T14:49:07.294Z] [DEBUG] [transcript] Claude project found but no transcripts folder: -Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall
```The folder exists and is found, but there's no `transcripts` subfolder. Let me check the actual structure of that folder.
