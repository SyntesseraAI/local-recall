## Thought

Now I understand the issue clearly:

**Current behavior:**
- `EpisodicJsonlStore` uses `config.memoryDir` (e.g., `./local-recall`) as baseDir
- Files are created as `local-recall/episodic-000001.jsonl`

**Expected behavior:**
- JSONL files should be inside the memory folders: `local-recall/episodic-memory/episodic-000001.jsonl`Let me also check:
1. The migration.ts to understand how it's supposed to work
2. Where embeddings are generated and stored

Let me also check the vector store to understand the embedding flow.

## Output

Now I see the issue. Let me check the vector store for embedding flow and then summarize all the gaps:
