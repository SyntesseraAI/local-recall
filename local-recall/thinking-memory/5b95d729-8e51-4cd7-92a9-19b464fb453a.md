## Thought

The user said "sounds great" but didn't specify which direction they want to go. I should ask them to clarify which of the options they'd like to pursue, since there were several potential directions listed.

## Output

Which direction would you like to go?

1. **Build the CLI** - Add `init`, `search`, `list`, `create` commands
2. **Memory deduplication** - Detect and merge similar memories
3. **Memory decay/pruning** - Archive stale memories automatically
4. **Smarter retrieval** - Context-aware memory loading based on current files
5. **Better stop hook analysis** - Improve automatic memory extraction
6. **Test it live** - Install the plugin in a real project and see how it performs

Or something else entirely?
