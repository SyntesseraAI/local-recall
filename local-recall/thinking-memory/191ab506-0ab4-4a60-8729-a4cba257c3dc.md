I see that `uuid` package is used in the project. I need to add a function to validate if a filename (without extension) is a valid UUID, then use it in:

1. `listSourceTranscripts()` - to filter source transcripts
2. `listLocalTranscripts()` - to filter local transcripts

Let me create a UUID validation function. A standard UUID v4 has the format: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` where x is any hex digit and y is one of 8, 9, a, or b.

I'll add a helper function to validate UUID filenames and update the filtering in both methods.
