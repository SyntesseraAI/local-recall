[2025-11-30T20:28:03.452Z] [ERROR] [extractor] Failed to parse Claude response: [
  {
    "code": "invalid_type",
    "expected": "string",
    "received": "undefined",
    "path": [
      "memories",
      0,
      "subject"
    ],
    ...
```

The Zod validation is receiving an object where the memory items exist (memories[0], memories[1], etc.) but all the required fields (subject, keywords, applies_to, content) are undefined.

This suggests Claude Haiku returned a JSON response with memory objects that had different field names or were structured differently than expected.

Some possible issues:
1. Claude might be returning fields with slightly different names (e.g., "title" instead of "subject")
2. The `--output-format json` might be wrapping the response in a way that's not being properly unwrapped
3. The response format from Haiku might be inconsistent

Let me check what the actual response format looks like. The `parseClaudeResponse` function tries to handle various formats but it seems like the memories array contains objects without the expected fields.

The user has shown me log output that shows what happened. Let me analyze and suggest a fix or investigation path.

Key observations:
1. The error shows 4 memory objects (memories[0] through memories[3]) all missing required fields
2. This means Claude DID return a memories array with objects, but those objects don't have the expected field names
3. The `parseClaudeResponse` function at line 154-198 tries to handle various response formats but doesn't handle this case

Possible solutions:
1. Add logging to see what the actual Claude response looks like
2. Add field name normalization/mapping (e.g., handle "title" -> "subject", "tags" -> "keywords")


3. Make the prompt clearer about required field names

I'll refine the prompt to explicitly specify the exact field names and structure needed. This will help ensure Claude generates responses with precisely the expected JSON schema. By providing clear, unambiguous instructions about field names and types, we can reduce parsing errors and improve response consistency.
