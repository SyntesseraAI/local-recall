Looking at the thinking extractor code, I can see that it does NOT filter thinking blocks at all. The `extractThinkingFromBlocks` function at line 41-46 simply extracts all thinking content from blocks and joins them. The `parseTranscriptForThinking` function at line 63-97 collects ALL thinking blocks from assistant messages.

So to answer the user's question: **Yes, the thinking-memory extractor captures ALL thinking blocks without any filtering.**

Now let me update the hooks to use readonly mode for their search operations. Let me read the hooks first.
