Now I have enough context to create the thinking-extractor.ts. The key differences are:
1. No Claude CLI call needed - extract thinking blocks directly
2. Process 20 files in parallel (instead of 5)
3. Generate subject from content automatically
4. Use ThinkingMemoryManager and ThinkingProcessedLogManager
