## Thought

This is just the permissions file. The MCP server config is likely in the user's global Claude settings or in the mcpServers configuration. The user mentioned "it's the env variable" so they just want to know what to set.

To enable episodic memory processing, they need to set:
```
LOCAL_RECALL_EPISODIC_ENABLED=true
```

This needs to be added to the `env` section of the MCP server configuration where the local-recall server is defined. Since I can't see their global settings, I should tell them what to add.

## Output

To enable episodic memory processing, add this environment variable to your MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-recall": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./dist/mcp-server/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "LOCAL_RECALL_DIR": "./local-recall",
        "LOCAL_RECALL_EPISODIC_ENABLED": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The key is `LOCAL_RECALL_EPISODIC_ENABLED=true` in the `env` section.

Currently:
- `episodicEnabled` defaults to `false` (`src/core/types.ts:118`)
- `thinkingEnabled` defaults to `true`

So you've had thinking memory on but episodic off. Once you add that env var and restart Claude Code, the MCP daemon will start processing transcripts every 5 minutes to extract episodic memories.
