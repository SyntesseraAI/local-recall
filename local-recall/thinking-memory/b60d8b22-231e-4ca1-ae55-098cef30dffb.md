## Thought

Now I need to update the `ensureGitignore()` method to also ensure the base directory exists before writing the `.gitignore` file. Currently it only checks if the file exists, but if the `local-recall` directory doesn't exist at all, it will fail.

Let me also update `ensureGitignore()` to create the base directory if needed:
