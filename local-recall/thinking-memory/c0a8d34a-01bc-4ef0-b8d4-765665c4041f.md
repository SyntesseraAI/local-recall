## Thought

The user wants to simplify the memory storage:
1. Don't summarize/extract - store the full message content
2. Store the role ("user" or "assistant") with the memory
3. Include messages that have content.type of "text" or "thinking"

This means I need to:
1. Update the transcript parsing in stop.ts to also include "thinking" content blocks
2. Simplify the analyzeForMemories function to store full messages instead of extracted snippets
3. Add role to the memory structure

Let me look at what needs to change:

1. In `stop.ts` - update the content extraction to include "thinking" type
2. In `transcript.ts` - simplify analyzeForMemories to store full message content with role
3. Maybe update the types to include role in the memory

Let me start by looking at the current structure and making changes.

## Output

Got it - simplify to store full messages with role. Let me update both the transcript parsing and the memory analysis.
