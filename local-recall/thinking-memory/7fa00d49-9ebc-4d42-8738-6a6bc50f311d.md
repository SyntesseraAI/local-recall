## Thought

Done! Now I should answer the user's question about testing. For a Claude Code plugin:
1. The plugin is installed locally from the filesystem
2. Changes to the scripts (hooks, MCP server) are already built
3. Restarting Claude Code should pick up the new version

But since this is the local-recall project itself, if they're using it as a plugin installed from the source, they might need to update the plugin or just restart Claude.

## Output

Done! Version bumped to `0.1.9` and pushed.

## Testing the Changes

Yes, **restarting Claude Code should be sufficient** since:

1. The hooks are already built (`local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/`)
2. The MCP server is already built (`local-recall-plugin/scripts/mcp-server/server.js`)
3. Changes take effect when Claude loads the plugin on startup

**To test:**
1. Restart Claude Code (or start a new session with `/clear`)
2. Create a new memory via the MCP tool
3. Check that the file is created as `episodic-000001.jsonl` (not `episodic.jsonl`)

```bash
# Verify the new format after creating a memory:
ls -la local-recall/episodic-*.jsonl
```

**Note:** Your existing markdown memory files in `local-recall/episodic-memory/` and `local-recall/thinking-memory/` will need to be migrated to JSONL format. The migration service should handle this automatically on first load, but if you want a clean start:

```bash
# Optional: clean slate (deletes existing memories!)
rm -rf local-recall/episodic-memory/ local-recall/thinking-memory/
rm -f local-recall/orama-*.json
```
