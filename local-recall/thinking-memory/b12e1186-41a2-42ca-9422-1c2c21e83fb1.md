## Thought

The user wants me to continue from where the conversation left off. Based on the summary, I was in the process of committing the changes after:
1. Implementing JSONL storage migration
2. Bumping version from 0.1.6 to 0.1.7
3. Running tests successfully (292 pass)
4. Staging files

The next step is to complete the git commit and push. Let me do that now.

First, let me check the current git status and then commit.

## Output

I'll continue with the commit and push. Let me first check the current git status to see what's staged.
