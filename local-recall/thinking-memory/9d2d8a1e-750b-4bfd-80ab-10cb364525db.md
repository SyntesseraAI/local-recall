## Thought

The user wants me to ensure that the transcript processing only handles files that have a UUID as the filename. Let me first understand the current implementation by looking at the transcript-related code.

I should search for where transcripts are being processed or copied.

## Output

I'll look at how transcripts are currently being processed to understand where the UUID filename validation needs to be added.
