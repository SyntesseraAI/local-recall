## Thought

The user is asking about the current MCP capabilities in the local-recall project. Based on the CLAUDE.md file that was provided in the system context, I can see the MCP server exposes these tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_create` | Create a new memory (idempotent) |
| `memory_get` | Retrieve a specific memory by ID |
| `memory_search` | Semantic search using vector embeddings |
| `memory_list` | List all memories with optional filtering |
| `index_rebuild` | Sync vector store with memory files |

I also have access to these tools in my current session (as indicated by the function list):
- `mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__memory_create`
- `mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__memory_get`
- `mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__memory_search`
- `mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__memory_list`
- `mcp__plugin_local-recall_local-recall__index_rebuild`

I can provide a clear summary based on the documentation and the available tools I see.

## Output

Based on the CLAUDE.md documentation and the tools available in this session, the Local Recall MCP server provides these capabilities:

## Available MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_create` | Create a new memory with subject, keywords, scope, and content (idempotent - returns existing if duplicate) |
| `memory_get` | Retrieve a specific memory by UUID |
| `memory_search` | Semantic search using vector embeddings (BGE-small-en-v1.5) |
| `memory_list` | List all memories with optional scope filtering and pagination |
| `index_rebuild` | Resync the vector store with memory files on disk |

## Background Daemon

The MCP server also runs a background daemon that:
- Syncs transcripts from Claude's cache every 5 minutes
- Processes transcripts using `claude -p` to extract memories automatically
- Tracks processed transcripts with content hashes for change detection
- Handles updates by deleting and recreating memories when transcripts change

## Search Capabilities

- Uses cosine distance similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0)
- Results sorted by score descending
- Recency tie-breaker when scores are equal
- Supports optional scope filtering
