## Thought

All done. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented.

## Output

Done. Build passes. Here's what was added:

## Changes

**1. `src/core/transcript-collector.ts:317-331`**
```typescript
async isSyntheticTranscript(info: TranscriptInfo): Promise<boolean>
```
Checks first 10KB for `"<synthetic>"` marker to identify memory-extraction generated transcripts.

**2. `src/core/thinking-extractor.ts:140-149`**
Early exit in `processTranscript()` - skips synthetic files before any processing.

**3. `src/core/memory-extractor.ts:441-450`**
Same early exit for memory extraction.

## Impact

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Processing 39,879 transcripts | Processing 27,285 real transcripts |
| Wasted cycles on 12,594 synthetic files | Synthetic files skipped with debug log |

The filter runs before content hash computation, so synthetic files are skipped as early as possible with minimal I/O.
