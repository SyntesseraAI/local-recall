## Thought

The user is reminding me that these flags should also turn off the processing/extraction - not just the hooks. So I need to also update:
1. The MCP server daemon that processes transcripts for episodic memories
2. The thinking extractor that processes transcripts for thinking memories

Let me check what files handle the processing. According to CLAUDE.md:
- `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` - Extract memories from transcripts (episodic)
- `src/core/thinking-extractor.ts` - Extract thinking blocks

And the MCP server (`src/mcp-server/server.ts`) runs a daemon that does the processing.

Let me update my todo list and check those files.

## Output

Good point - I need to also disable the extraction/processing. Let me add that to the todo list and check the MCP server and extractors.
