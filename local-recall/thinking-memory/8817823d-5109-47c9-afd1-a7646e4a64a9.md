## Thought

Ollama is running and the nomic-embed-text model is available. The error was likely a transient network issue or Ollama briefly restarted. The error message shows port 62797, which is unusual - Ollama normally runs on 11434. This might be a proxy or there was something funky going on.

The error should resolve on its own on the next sync cycle (every 5 minutes). This is a non-critical error - the thinking memory sync just failed once and will retry.

## Output

Ollama is running fine now. The error was transient - the connection to port `62797` (which looks like a temporary proxy port) got dropped mid-request. 

This is a non-critical error - the thinking vector sync runs periodically and will succeed on the next cycle (every 5 minutes). The `EOF` error typically means:
- Ollama briefly restarted
- Network hiccup between the MCP server and Ollama
- Request timeout

No action needed - it should self-heal on the next sync.
