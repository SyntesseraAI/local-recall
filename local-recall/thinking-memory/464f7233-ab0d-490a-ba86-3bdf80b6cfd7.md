## Thought

Done! All version references have been updated and pushed.

## Output

Done! Version bumped to `0.1.4` in all three files and pushed:

- `package.json`
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Version synchronization in plugins:** Claude Code plugins have multiple version references that must stay in sync - the npm `package.json` for the library itself, plus the `.claude-plugin/` manifest files that the marketplace uses to detect and distribute updates. Missing any of these can cause version mismatches between what's installed vs. what's advertised.
