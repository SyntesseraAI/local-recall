The user wants to update the code that finds Claude project folders. Currently it seems like the code can't find the right project folder. The projects are located in `~/.claude/projects/` and the folder names are based on the path to the repo, with slashes replaced by dashes.

For example:
- Current repo: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Project folder: `~/.claude/projects/-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

I need to find where in the code this project path lookup is happening and update it to search correctly.

Let me search for where this logic exists in the codebase.
