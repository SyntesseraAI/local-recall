## Thought

The scripts were built today (Dec 21) at 18:24, which is very recent. This means the local plugin scripts are up to date with the latest code.

However, the issue is that the *marketplace* is showing version 0.1.6. This means either:
1. The plugin hasn't been published to the marketplace at 0.1.9 yet
2. The user's Claude Code is caching the old version

Let me summarize for the user:
- Local files: 0.1.9 (both package.json and plugin.json)
- Plugin scripts: freshly built today
- Marketplace: showing 0.1.6 (needs publishing)

The local files are correct at 0.1.9, but the marketplace listing hasn't been updated with the new version yet.

## Output

Your **local files are at version 0.1.9** (the latest), but the **marketplace hasn't been updated** yet.

Here's what I found:

| Location | Version | Last Modified |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| `package.json` | 0.1.9 | Commit `1c88d59` |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | 0.1.9 | Same commit |
| `local-recall-plugin/scripts/hooks/` | Built today (Dec 21) | 18:24 |

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
The plugin has two version touchpoints: `package.json` for npm and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for the Claude marketplace. When you ran `/plugin` to update from the marketplace, it pulled the **published** version (0.1.6), not your local development version (0.1.9).
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

**What this means:**
- Your local source code is at 0.1.9 ✅
- The bundled scripts in `local-recall-plugin/scripts/` are freshly built ✅
- The marketplace listing still shows 0.1.6 (hasn't been published yet)

To update the marketplace, you'd need to publish the plugin. Would you like me to check if there's a publish script or help you push 0.1.9 to the marketplace?
