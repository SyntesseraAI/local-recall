## Thought

Looking at the code, I see that `callClaudeCLI` on line 75-128 uses `claude -p` with args but doesn't specify a model. Let me check the existing test file and also the prompt building function to understand the full picture.

The key thing is that the current code doesn't specify a model - it just runs `claude` with `-p`, `--output-format json`, `--max-turns 1`, and `--strict-mcp-config`. To use Haiku, we need to add `--model haiku` to the args.

Let me also look at the test file and the prompt file to understand the expected behavior better.

## Output

Let me look at the test file and the prompt to understand the full picture:
