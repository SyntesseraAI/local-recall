## Thought

Done. The processed-log.jsonl files have been removed from git tracking and added back to .gitignore.

## Output

Done. The `processed-log.jsonl` and `thinking-processed-log.jsonl` files have been:
- Removed from git tracking (`git rm --cached`)
- Added back to `.gitignore`
- Files still exist locally but won't be committed

The files are now properly gitignored as local state that gets regenerated from transcripts.
