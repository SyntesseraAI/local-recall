## Thought

The build passes now. The fix was simple - using optional chaining `codeBlockMatch?.[1]` ensures TypeScript knows we're checking both that the match exists and that the capture group exists before accessing it.

## Output

Build successful. The fix uses optional chaining (`codeBlockMatch?.[1]`) to safely check both that the regex matched and that the capture group exists before accessing it.
