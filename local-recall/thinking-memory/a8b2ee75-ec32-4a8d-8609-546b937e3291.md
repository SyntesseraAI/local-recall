The user is pointing out that the system should be capturing "thinking" messages from the transcript. They've provided an example of what a thinking message looks like in the transcript format.

Looking at the example:
- It has a `content` array with a `type: "thinking"` block
- The thinking block has a `thinking` field with the actual thinking text
- It also has a `signature` field

The user seems to be saying that the current transcript parsing isn't capturing these thinking messages properly. Let me look at the transcript.ts file to understand how it's currently parsing messages and whether it handles thinking content.
