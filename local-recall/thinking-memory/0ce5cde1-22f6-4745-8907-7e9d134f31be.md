## Thought

The push was successful. The rewritten commits have been pushed to the remote. The local_cache files are now removed from the git history on both local and remote.

## Output

Pushed. The `local_cache/` files are now removed from git history on the remote.

Note: The `.gitignore` change (adding `local_cache/`) is still uncommitted if you want to commit that separately.
