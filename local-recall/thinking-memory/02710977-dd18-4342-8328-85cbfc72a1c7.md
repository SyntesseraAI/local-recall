## Thought

The user is asking me to extract memories from this transcript about Claude plugins, Rules system, and the implementation of skills for local-recall.

Let me analyze what was learned and done:

1. **Key finding about Claude**: There is no formal "Rules system" - behavior is controlled through Skills, Settings files, CLAUDE.md files, Hooks, and MCP tool descriptions.

2. **Skills were created**: Two new skills were created:
   - `check-memories/SKILL.md` - For checking memories when users ask about past decisions
   - `proactive-recall/SKILL.md` - For proactively recalling memories

3. **Plugin improvements**: The plugin.json was updated to improve plugin description and keywords for better discoverability.

4. **MCP tools documentation**: The tools.ts file had documentation improvements added.

5. **Version bump**: Package.json version was bumped from 0.1.2 to 0.1.3.

6. **Integration approach**: Skills are the mechanism to integrate local-recall into Claude's decision-making, not a separate Rules system.

7. **Architecture decision**: Skills are auto-discovered in the ./skills/ directory - no manifest changes needed.

Let me extract the most valuable memories:

1. **Claude doesn't have a Rules system** - Instead it has Skills, Settings, CLAUDE.md, Hooks, and MCP descriptions. This is important for understanding how to integrate local-recall.

2. **Skills are the integration point** - Skills (model-invoked, autonomously triggered) are how Claude invokes local-recall to check memories. They're auto-discovered from the ./skills/ directory.

3. **Two types of skills were created**:
   - `check-memories` - For explicit memory lookups when users ask about past decisions
   - `proactive-recall` - For proactively suggesting relevant memories before implementation

4. **Plugin discoverability** - Updated plugin.json with better description and keywords to help Claude discover and use the local-recall plugin.
 
The MCP tools serve as the critical mechanism for memory retrieval, enabling skills to dynamically search and access episodic and thinking-related memories through specialized search functions.
