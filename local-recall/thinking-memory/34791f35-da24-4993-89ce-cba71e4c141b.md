## Thought

OK, so the transcripts are JSONL format. Each line is a JSON object. Looking at the structure, thinking blocks are inside assistant messages as content blocks with `type: "thinking"`. Let me show the user how to count thinking blocks.

## Output

Now I understand the structure. Here's how to count thinking blocks in the transcripts:

**Method 1: Quick grep count**
```bash
# Count lines containing "type":"thinking" across all transcripts
grep -c '"type":"thinking"' local-recall/transcripts/*.jsonl | awk -F: '{sum+=$2} END {print sum}'
```

**Method 2: More precise with jq**
```bash
# Count thinking content blocks in all transcripts
cat local-recall/transcripts/*.jsonl | jq -r 'select(.type=="assistant") | .message.content[]? | select(.type=="thinking")' 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

**Method 3: Per-file breakdown**
```bash
# See which transcripts have thinking blocks
grep -l '"type":"thinking"' local-recall/transcripts/*.jsonl | wc -l
```

Let me run these for you:
