## Thought

The user is asking about whether multiple local-recall MCP server instances can communicate with each other or interfere with each other. Let me think about the current architecture:

1. Each Claude Code instance spawns its own MCP server process via stdio
2. Each MCP server has its own daemon that:
   - Syncs transcripts from ~/.claude/projects/
   - Processes transcripts to extract memories
   - Updates Orama indexes

The potential issues with multiple instances:
1. **File-based indexes**: Multiple processes writing to the same `orama-episodic-index.json` and `orama-thinking-index.json` could cause corruption
2. **Processed logs**: Multiple processes updating `processed-log.jsonl` could cause race conditions
3. **Memory files**: Multiple processes creating memory files simultaneously

Let me check the current implementation to understand how this is handled.

## Output

Good question. Let me check how multiple instances interact.
