## Thought

Now I understand the structure. Looking at the thinking extractor:
- Thinking blocks are in content blocks with `type: 'thinking'`
- The function `parseTranscriptForThinking` looks for `block.type === 'thinking'` 

So in the transcript, a thinking block would appear as a JSON object with `"type":"thinking"`. I can check for this string in the file content, similar to how we check for synthetic transcripts.

The modification should be in `syncTranscripts()` in `transcript-collector.ts`. I need to:
1. Add a method `hasThinkingBlocks()` that checks if a transcript contains thinking content
2. Skip copying transcripts that don't have thinking blocks

Let me create this change.

## Output

Now I understand the structure. Thinking blocks appear in transcripts as content blocks with `"type":"thinking"`. I'll add a method to check for thinking content and filter transcripts during sync.
