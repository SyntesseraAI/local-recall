## Thought

The `index.js` file is dated `Dec 1 18:20` - it's stale! Most other files are from `Dec 21 19:16` (today). 

This explains everything:
1. There's an old `dist/core/index.js` with an `IndexManager` class from December 1st
2. The source file `src/core/index.ts` no longer exists
3. The old `IndexManager` reads markdown files

This is a stale build artifact that should have been cleaned up. Let me check what the issue actually is - is this `IndexManager` being used anywhere?

## Output

Found the issue! The `dist/core/index.js` is dated **Dec 1st** while all other files are from **Dec 21st** (today). This is a stale build artifact containing an `IndexManager` class that reads `.md` files.

Let me check if this stale file is being used:
