## Thought

This is just the word "insights" appearing in the memory extraction prompt, not the actual "insight" content blocks from explanatory mode.

2. Do you have an example of what insights look like when displayed - are they shown inline with text, or as separate UI elements?

Let me check your Claude Code settings to see if explanatory mode is configured:
