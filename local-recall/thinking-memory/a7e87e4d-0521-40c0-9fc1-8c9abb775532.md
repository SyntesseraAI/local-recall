## Thought

There are a lot of files being tracked. I can see the thinking-memory files are being deleted (they were previously committed but are now regenerated) and new episodic-memory files are being added. I should commit the core code changes for the multi-file JSONL storage. The memory files changes seem to be a separate issue - they may have been regenerated.

Let me focus on committing the core changes:
- src/core/jsonl-store.ts
- src/core/episodic-jsonl-store.ts
- src/core/thinking-jsonl-store.ts
- tests/unit/core/episodic-jsonl-store.test.ts
- tests/unit/core/memory.test.ts
- tests/unit/core/thinking-memory.test.ts
- local-recall-plugin/scripts/* (built files)

I'll add only the source code changes and skip the memory files for now, since those seem to be local state changes.

## Output

I see there are a lot of memory files that have changed. Let me focus on committing just the core code changes:
