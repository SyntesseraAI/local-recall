## Thought

Now I have the counts. Let me provide a clear summary. The user wanted to know how to validate thinking blocks.

## Output

Here's the summary for your transcripts:

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total transcript files | 39,879 |
| Transcripts with thinking blocks | 51 |
| Total thinking blocks | 1,101 |

**How to validate:**

```bash
# In local-recall/transcripts directory:

# 1. Total transcripts
find . -name "*.jsonl" | wc -l

# 2. Files containing thinking blocks  
find . -name "*.jsonl" | xargs grep -l '"type":"thinking"' | wc -l

# 3. Total thinking block count
find . -name "*.jsonl" | xargs grep -oh '"type":"thinking"' | wc -l

# 4. Count per file (to see distribution)
find . -name "*.jsonl" -exec grep -c '"type":"thinking"' {} \; | sort -rn | head -20
```

The thinking blocks are in assistant message entries at `entry.message.content[]` where the content block has `type: "thinking"`. This matches the schema at `src/types/transcript-schema.ts:43-47`.
