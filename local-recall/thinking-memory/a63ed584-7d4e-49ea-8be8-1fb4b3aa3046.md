## Thought

The user wants to have a casual chat about sausages and stew. This is completely unrelated to the codebase I'm working in (local-recall, a memory system for AI coding assistants). I should engage in friendly conversation about this topic.

## Output

Sausages and stew - a classic combination! What's on your mind? Are you thinking about a specific dish like:

- **Cassoulet** - the French white bean stew with various sausages and duck confit
- **Irish stew with bangers** - hearty potatoes, onions, and pork sausages
- **Andouille in gumbo** - Louisiana-style with that smoky, spicy kick
- **Italian sausage in ribollita** - Tuscan bread soup made even better

Or are you contemplating making something yourself? I'm happy to chat recipes, techniques, or just wax poetic about comfort food.
