## Thought

The user is asking if I can see Github Copilot's comments in the file they have open. They mentioned that the file `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/src/core/types.ts` is open in their IDE.

I need to read this file to see what's in it and check if there are any comments from GitHub Copilot or any comments at all.

## Output

I'll read the file to see what's there.
