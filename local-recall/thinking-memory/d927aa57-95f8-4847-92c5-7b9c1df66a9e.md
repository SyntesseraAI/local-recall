## Thought

The user wants me to:
1. Document the changed files (src/core/index.ts, src/core/memory.ts, src/core/types.ts, src/hooks/stop.ts, src/index.ts, src/mcp-server/tools.ts, src/utils/markdown.ts, src/utils/transcript.ts)
2. Document that they don't summarize or filter memories

I need to first read the changed files to understand what they do, then update the documentation accordingly. Let me start by reading the modified files to understand their current state.

## Output

I'll read the changed files first to understand their current implementation, then update the documentation.
