## Thought

Now I understand the full picture. The issue is:

1. The `user-prompt-submit.ts` hook guards against internal prompts by checking for the `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` prefix at line 161
2. The `buildMemoryExtractionPrompt` in `src/prompts/memory-extraction.ts` does NOT include this prefix
3. When the MCP server's daemon calls `claude -p` with the memory extraction prompt, it goes through Claude Code's normal prompt flow, which triggers the `UserPromptSubmit` hook again
4. Since the memory extraction prompt doesn't have the `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` prefix, the hook doesn't skip it, causing recursion issues

The fix should be to add the `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` prefix to the memory extraction prompt in `buildMemoryExtractionPrompt`.

Let me fix this:

## Output

I found the issue. The guard at line 161 of `user-prompt-submit.ts` checks for `[LOCAL_RECALL_INTERNAL]` prefix, but the memory extraction prompt from `buildMemoryExtractionPrompt` doesn't include that prefix.

The fix is simple - add the prefix to the memory extraction prompt:
