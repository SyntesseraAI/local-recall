Now I understand the current flow:

1. `TranscriptCollector.readTranscript()` reads the raw JSONL content
2. `buildMemoryExtractionPrompt()` wraps the raw content in a prompt and sends it to Claude CLI
3. Claude parses the JSONL and extracts memories

The problem is that the **entire raw JSONL** is being passed to Claude, including:
- Full file contents from Read tool results
- Full stdout/stderr from Bash commands
- Thinking content (which can be very long)
- Tool use blocks that may not be relevant for memory extraction

The user provided a comprehensive TypeScript type file for the transcript schema. They want to use this to parse the JSONL and create a minimal, condensed representation for memory extraction.

Let me design a solution:

1. Create a new type file based on the schema provided
2. Create a transcript parser that converts raw JSONL into a minimal format
3. Update the memory extraction prompt to use this minimal format

The minimal format should include:
- User prompts (text content only)
- Assistant responses (text content, but truncated if very long)
- Tool use summaries (tool name, description, maybe key parameters)
- Tool results (summarized - just success/failure and key info)
- Skip thinking content (not useful for memory extraction)
- Skip file-history-snapshot and queue-operation entries

Let me look at the core types file to see what's already there.
