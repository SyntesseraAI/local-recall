## Thought

The user wants to rename the "memories" folder to "episodic-memory" across the codebase. This involves:

1. Renaming the actual folder
2. Updating all code references
3. Updating the .gitignore file
4. Updating documentation (CLAUDE.md)

Let me first explore what files reference "memories" to understand the scope of changes needed.

## Output

I'll help you rename the "memories" folder to "episodic-memory" across the codebase. Let me first find all the references that need to be updated.
