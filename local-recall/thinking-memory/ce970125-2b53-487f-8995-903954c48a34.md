The user wants to turn on episodic memory processing. Looking at the context, I can see this is the local-recall project which has memory extraction from transcripts. Let me check what the current state is and what needs to be enabled.

From the CLAUDE.md, I can see:
- The Stop hook is mentioned as "currently disabled"
- Memory extraction is handled by the MCP server daemon which processes transcripts asynchronously every 5 minutes

So "turning on" episodic memory processing likely means enabling the Stop hook or ensuring the daemon is running. Let me check what the current configuration looks like and what needs to be changed.

I should look at:
1. The current hooks configuration
2. The stop.ts hook implementation
3. The MCP server daemon setup

Let me start by checking the settings file and the current state of things.
