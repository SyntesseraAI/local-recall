## Thought

Pushed successfully. Now the user should update the plugin in Claude Code to refresh the cache. Let me tell them to do that.

## Output

Done! Pushed to GitHub (`fd0d611..7a3b9e0`).

Now update the plugin cache in Claude Code:

```
/plugin update syntesseraai-local-recall
```

Or restart Claude Code - the plugin should automatically update since `autoUpdate: true` is set.

After updating, the MCP server should start successfully because `scripts/mcp-server/server.js` will now be in the plugin cache.
