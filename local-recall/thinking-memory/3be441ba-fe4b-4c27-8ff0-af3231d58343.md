## Thought

The hook is working! It extracted keywords "sausages, stew" but found 0 results. That's interesting because when we searched earlier, we found results. Let me check - perhaps the fuzzy search threshold is different or there's an issue with the keyword index.

Earlier when we searched via MCP with "sausages food" it found 4 results. Let me check what's in the index:

## Output

The hook is working - it extracted keywords and searched. Let me check why no results were found:
