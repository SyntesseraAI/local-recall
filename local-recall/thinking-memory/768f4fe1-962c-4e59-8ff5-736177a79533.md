I can see the issue. The `findClaudeProjectDir` method has multiple approaches to find the project directory:

1. It reads all project directories and checks the `cwd` field in transcript files
2. It tries a hash-based approach (which appears to be wrong - Claude doesn't use hashes)
3. It does a "last resort" check that looks for directories containing the basename of the project

The user is telling me that Claude's project folders are named using the full path with slashes replaced by dashes. For example:
- Project path: `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall`
- Claude folder: `-Users-joe-Code-Syntessera-local-recall`

So the naming pattern is: replace all `/` with `-` and keep the leading dash.

Let me update the `findClaudeProjectDir` method to:
1. First try to find a directory whose name matches the path-to-dashed pattern
2. Then fall back to the existing approaches

I should create a helper method that converts a project path to the Claude folder name format.
