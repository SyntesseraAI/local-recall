## Thought

Perfect! The `.gitignore` file has been created successfully. Now I should unstage the deletion of the `.gitignore` file from git since it should be tracked (the file itself is version-controlled, only the files it references should be ignored).

Actually, wait. Let me re-read the CLAUDE.md file to see what should be version-controlled:

```
├── local-recall/                # Memory storage (version-controlled)
│   ├── .gitignore               # Auto-generated, excludes index.json and recall.log
│   ├── index.json               # Keyword index cache (gitignored)
│   ├── recall.log               # Debug log file (gitignored)
│   └── memories/                # Individual memory files (tracked in git)
│       └── *.md                 # Memory markdown files
```

So the `.gitignore` file itself SHOULD be version-controlled (it's listed as part of the version-controlled memory storage). The git status shows it as deleted, so I should restore it.

## Output

Excellent! The `.gitignore` file has been created successfully. Now let me restore it in git since the file itself should be version-controlled:
