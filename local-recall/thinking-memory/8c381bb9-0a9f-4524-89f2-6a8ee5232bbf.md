## Thought

Ah, this is interesting! The user is saying that:
1. I am running in the VS Code extension environment
2. The hooks are NOT firing for me (the extension)
3. But the hooks DO work in the console/CLI version of Claude Code

Looking at the memories, they actually contain information about this exact issue - that the Stop hook has never fired in the VS Code extension environment.

Let me investigate this. I should:
1. Check the hooks configuration
2. Look at the hook implementations
3. See if there's any documentation about hook support in different environments
4. Check if there are differences between how hooks work in CLI vs extension

The user is pointing out a real issue - the hooks that create memories, search memories, etc. are not firing when I'm running in the VS Code extension.

## Output

You're absolutely right! That's a critical issue. Let me investigate why hooks aren't firing in the VS Code extension environment.
