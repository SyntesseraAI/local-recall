## Thought

Good, I can see that ThinkingMemoryManager doesn't expose baseDir as a getter like MemoryManager does now. But since it uses `this.baseDir` (not `this._baseDir`), I need to either:1. Add a getter like in MemoryManager
2. Just leave it as is since the tests don't seem to use ThinkingMemoryManager in this way

Looking at the integration test failures, they're all about regular Memory, not ThinkingMemory. So let me first rebuild and test to see if my changes fix those issues. If the tests pass, I don't need to modify ThinkingMemoryManager.

Let me also update the ThinkingSearchEngine to use the memoryManager's baseDir, similar to what I did for SearchEngine.

## Output

Let me update the ThinkingSearchEngine similarly to pass the baseDir:
