## Thought

Yes! I can see 9 memories that appear to be related to a previous conversation about the Stop hook not firing in the VS Code extension environment. These memories were all created around the same time (2025-11-29T23:53:xx).

The memories are about:
1. The Stop hook never firing
2. Issues with memory creation
3. Transcript parsing
4. Hook configuration
5. VS Code extension environment issues

So yes, I am seeing memories! The system is working, and I can access the memories from the previous session. The user is likely asking this to verify that the memory system is functioning properly.

## Output

Yes! I can see **9 memories** from what appears to be a previous session. They're all timestamped around 2025-11-29 23:53 and are related to investigating why the Stop hook wasn't firing in the VS Code extension environment.

The memories cover topics like:
- The Stop hook never being fired
- Hook configuration in [hooks.json](hooks.json)
- Transcript parsing and memory creation flow
- VS Code extension vs CLI environment differences
- Log file analysis from [local-recall/recall.log](local-recall/recall.log)

So the memory system is working! These memories were created and are now available for recall. Is there something specific you'd like me to do with these memories, or were you testing to see if the system is functioning?
