## Thought

There it is! Line 142-143 in `.gitignore`:```
# Plugin scripts folder (build output)
scripts/
local-recall-plugin/scripts/
```

The `local-recall-plugin/scripts/` directory is explicitly gitignored! This is the root cause - when the plugin is fetched from GitHub, the scripts directory doesn't exist because it's not tracked in Git.

The fix is to:
1. Remove `local-recall-plugin/scripts/` from `.gitignore`
2. Add and commit the scripts directory to Git
3. Push to GitHub
4. Update the plugin in Claude Code

Let me explain this to the user and provide the fix.

## Output

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND!**

Lines 142-143 in `.gitignore` explicitly exclude the scripts:

```gitignore
# Plugin scripts folder (build output)
scripts/
local-recall-plugin/scripts/
```

The `local-recall-plugin/scripts/` directory is **gitignored**, so when Claude Code fetches the plugin from GitHub, the MCP server files don't exist!

**Plugin Distribution via Git:**
- Claude Code fetches plugins from Git repos (GitHub in this case)
- Only files committed to Git are included in the plugin cache
- Build outputs like bundled scripts need to be either:
  1. **Committed to Git** (if they're the distribution artifact), OR
  2. **Built at install time** (requires npm post-install hooks)

## The Fix

You need to commit the bundled scripts to Git. Here's how:
