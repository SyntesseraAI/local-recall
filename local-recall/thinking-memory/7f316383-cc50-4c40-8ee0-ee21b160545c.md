## Thought

The user is asking if memories ever get compacted - meaning are they merged, deduplicated, summarized, or cleaned up in any way over time.

Let me search through the codebase to see if there's any compaction, merging, or deduplication logic for memories.

## Output

Let me search the codebase for any compaction or deduplication logic.
