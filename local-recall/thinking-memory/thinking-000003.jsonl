The thinking memories contain observations like:\n   - `\"hook_name\":\"SessionStart:Callback\",\"hook_event\":\"SessionStart\",\"stdout\":\"\",\"stderr\":\"\"`\n   - Hooks show \"success\" but `stdout` is empty\n   - \"The fact that you see `Callback hook success: Success` instead of the actual output suggests something in the plugin layer is capturing stdout and replacing it with a status message\"\n\n2.

Instead, Claude only sees a status message like \"hook success: Success\".\n\nThis could be:\n1. A bug in how Claude Code handles hook stdout for plugins\n2. A configuration issue in how the hooks are registered\n3. Something about the `:Callback` suffix that changes behavior\n\nLet me look at this more carefully. The grep also shows:\n- `\"The hooks ARE being triggered (SessionStart:Callback shows up in logs)\"`\n- `\"The session's callback hook, marked with a VS Code extension-specific :Callback suffix\"`\n\nSo the `:Callback` suffix seems to be a VS Code extension thing. Maybe the issue is that plugin hooks in Claude Code work differently than direct hooks in `.claude/settings.json`.\n\nLet me check if there's a way to configure hooks directly in the project's `.claude/settings.json` to bypass the plugin layer.\n\n## Output\n\n**CRITICAL FINDING!** The thinking memories contain the answer.

On Memory Creation (immediate)\nIn `src/core/memory.ts:107-113`, when a memory is created via `MemoryManager.createMemory()`:\n- Memory is written to disk as a markdown file\n- Then immediately added to the vector store with `vectorStore.add(memory)`\n- This generates an embedding and inserts into both `memories` and `memory_embeddings` tables\n\n### 2. MCP Server Startup Sync (deferred)\nIn `src/mcp-server/server.ts:88-93`, the server runs an initial vector sync 2 seconds after startup:\n```typescript\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  runVectorSync()  // Calls vectorStore.sync(memories)\n}, 2000);\n```\n\nThe `sync()` method (`vector-store.ts:292-323`):\n- Loads all file-based memories via `memoryManager.listMemories()`\n- Compares with what's in the SQLite store\n- Adds any missing memories, removes any orphaned entries\n\n### 3. Periodic Background Sync\nThe MCP server also syncs every 10 minutes (`VECTOR_SYNC_INTERVAL_MS`) to catch any drift between files and SQLite.\n\n### Summary\nThe SQLite store is populated:\n- **Immediately** when memories are created\n- **On startup** via initial sync\n- **Periodically** (every 10 minutes) as a safety net\n\nIt's **not** a full reload every time - `sync()` does a delta comparison using `getStoredIds()` and only adds/removes what's changed.","timestamp":"2025-12-21T19:27:13.229Z"}

Let me analyze what happened:\n\n## Key Findings from the Transcript:\n\n1. **The Problem**: Users were getting mutex lock errors when sqlite-vec tried to load in hooks, even though it should have been read-only. This was because:\n   - sqlite-vec uses internal C++ `std::mutex` structures\n   - When multiple processes load the extension, these mutexes fail\n   - The error occurs at native code level, not SQLite database level\n   - SQLite was running in multi-thread mode (THREADSAFE=2), not serialized mode\n\n2. **The Root Cause**: \n   - sqlite-vec's internal C++ mutexes can fail with \"Invalid argument\" when processes exit or cleanup happens\n   - The file-based locking (`withDbMutex`) was serializing access, but that doesn't help with native C++ mutexes\n   - Multi-thread mode (THREADSAFE=2) means SQLite assumes each connection is used by only one thread at a time\n\n3. **The Solution**:\n   - Migrated from sqlite-vec to Orama (pure JavaScript vector database)\n   - Removed `better-sqlite3` and `sqlite-vec` dependencies\n   - Removed `database.ts` which had the file-based mutex locking\n   - Updated both episodic and thinking vector stores to use Orama\n   - Key technical fix: Set `similarity: 0` in Orama search to disable default 0.8 threshold (they handle their own filtering)\n\n4. **Orama Specifics**:\n   - Uses persistent JSON-based indexes (`orama-episodic.json`, `orama-thinking.json`)\n   - Supports vector search with configurable dimensions\n   - Default similarity threshold of ~0.8 can filter out valid results - need to disable\n   - Works with fastembed embeddings (same as before)\n\n5. **Key Discovery**: \n   - Long document content with embeddings caused vector search to return 0 results\n   - Orama's default similarity threshold of 0.8 was filtering out results with ~0.77 similarity\n   - Disabling the threshold by setting `similarity: 0` resolved the search issue\n\n6. **Testing Validation**:\n   - Vector persistence and restoration confirmed working\n   - Precise schema configuration with `vector[384]` dimensions critical\n   - Memory synchronization process functioning as expected\n\nI'll proceed with memory extractions based on these insights.\n\n## Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"memories\": [\n    {\n      \"subject\": \"sqlite-vec mutex errors caused by C++ pthread mutexes failing across processes\",\n      \"keywords\": [\"sqlite-vec\", \"mutex\", \"threading\", \"native extension\", \"hook errors\", \"process isolation\"],\n      \"applies_to\": \"global\",\n      \"content\": \"The \\\"mutex lock failed: Invalid argument\\\" errors were NOT coming from SQLite's database locks, but from sqlite-vec's internal C++ `std::mutex` structures.

The transcript being passed to `claude -p` is too large to fit in the command line arguments.\n\n4. **The raw response parsing issue:**\n   Looking at the raw response, it seems like the extractor is getting a full transcript/session data instead of just the memory extraction response. The raw response contains system messages, init data, etc.\n\nLet me read the relevant source files to understand what's happening:\n1. `src/core/memory-extractor.ts` - to see how it processes Claude responses\n2. `src/hooks/user-prompt-submit.ts` - to see how it handles prompts\n   \nI'm seeing critical parsing problems with the memory extraction process. The system is struggling to correctly extract meaningful memory data, with multiple symptoms pointing to fundamental issues in response handling. Specifically, the extraction mechanism is failing to parse the response correctly, resulting in empty memory objects and potential data loss.\n\nThe core challenges involve incorrect JSON parsing, oversized transcript handling, and incomplete response filtering. These issues suggest a need for more robust parsing logic and improved error handling in the memory extraction pipeline.\n\n## Output\n\nLooking at the logs, I can see several issues:\n\n1. **Empty memory objects being returned** - Claude is returning `{\"memories\": [{}, {}, {}, {}]}` instead of properly populated memory objects, causing Zod validation to fail\n\n2. **E2BIG error** - Some transcripts are too large to pass as command-line arguments to `claude -p`\n\n3. **Raw response parsing confusion** - The extractor seems to be parsing the full session data instead of just Claude's response\n\nLet me examine the memory extractor code to understand what's happening:","timestamp":"2025-12-21T19:27:13.251Z"}

The issue is clear:\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe `mutex lock failed: Invalid argument` error occurs because:\n\n1. **Singleton pattern holds persistent database connections** - `getVectorStore()` and `getThinkingVectorStore()` create singleton instances with database connections that persist for the process lifetime\n\n2. **sqlite-vec native extension uses internal mutexes** - When loading `sqlite-vec`, the native library creates mutexes for thread safety\n\n3. **Process exit causes unpredictable destruction order** - When the hook calls `process.exit(0)`, Node.js garbage collects objects. The order of destruction is not guaranteed:\n   - The `sqlite-vec` internal mutexes might be destroyed\n   - Then some cleanup code tries to use those destroyed mutexes\n   - This causes \"mutex lock failed: Invalid argument\"\n\n4. **Multiple hook processes competing** - Both `user-prompt-submit.ts` and `user-prompt-submit-thinking.ts` run as separate processes, potentially at the same time, and both try to load `sqlite-vec` and access the database\n\n## Solution\n\nThe fix is to make database connections ephemeral - open them for a single operation, then close them immediately. This is exactly what the user suggested: \"connections only exist for atomic operations\".\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n1. **Modify `VectorStore` class** to not use singleton pattern - each instance gets its own connection\n2. **Add explicit connection lifecycle** - open at start of search, close at end\n3. **Same changes for `ThinkingVectorStore`**\n4. **Update `SearchEngine` and `ThinkingSearchEngine`** to create fresh stores per search\n5. **Remove the singleton getters** or have them create new instances each time\n\nActually, looking at this more carefully, the cleanest approach is:\n- Keep the VectorStore class but make it not hold the connection persistently\n- Use a pattern where each search operation:\n  1. Opens a connection\n  2. Does the search\n  3. Closes the connection in a finally block\n\nI'll implement a robust connection management strategy that ensures clean, short-lived database interactions. The key is to create and destroy connections for each atomic operation, preventing any lingering resource conflicts or mutex-related errors.\n\n## Output\n\nNow I understand the issue. Based on the research and code review:\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe `mutex lock failed: Invalid argument` error happens because:\n\n1. **Singleton pattern holds persistent database connections** - `getVectorStore()` and `getThinkingVectorStore()` create singletons with database connections that persist for the process lifetime\n2. **sqlite-vec native extension uses internal mutexes** - when the process exits, Node.js garbage collects objects in an unpredictable order\n3. **Mutex destroyed before cleanup completes** - the sqlite-vec internal mutexes may be destroyed while cleanup code is still trying to use them\n\nFrom the [Stack Overflow research](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30090108/what-does-mutex-lock-fail-with-invalid-argument-mean): *\"This typically happens when .lock() is called on a mutex that is not yet constructed, or has already been destructed.\"*\n\nAnd from the [Apache Arrow issue](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/15189): *\"this might be something along the lines of a mutex lock attempt after the mutex has been destructed.\"*\n\n## Solution\n\nYou're right - connections should only exist for atomic operations.

Replaced the sequential `for` loop with a semaphore-controlled `Promise.all`\n\nThe semaphore pattern spawns all transcript promises immediately, but `acquire()` blocks until a slot is available. As each completes and calls `release()`, the next waiting task proceeds. This keeps all 10 slots filled continuously until all transcripts are processed.","timestamp":"2025-12-21T19:27:13.268Z"}

The session is about investigating and fixing a \"mutex lock failed: Invalid argument\" error in the local-recall project, and implementing a hook-daemon communication architecture using HTTP.\n\nLet me identify the key learnings and insights:\n\n1. **Root Cause Discovery**: The mutex error happens when a thread attempts to lock a mutex that has already been destroyed. This is specifically related to sqlite-vec's internal C++ mutexes.\n\n2. **Architecture Change**: The session involved implementing a hook-daemon communication system using HTTP to avoid direct sqlite-vec access from hooks (which causes the mutex issue). This is a significant architectural decision.\n\n3. **Specific Implementation Details**:\n   - Created http-server.ts in mcp-server\n   - Created daemon-client.ts utility\n   - Updated hooks (user-prompt-submit.ts, session-start.ts) to use daemon client\n   - Session-start doesn't use sqlite-vec (safe from mutex issue)\n   - Default HTTP port changed to 7847\n\n4. **Technical Details**:\n   - Better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec has threading issues\n   - The hooks should be thin clients that communicate with the daemon\n   - The daemon owns the database connections\n   - Tests all passed (289 tests)\n\n5. **Configuration**: HTTP port is now 7847 instead of 3000\n\nLet me extract the most valuable memories:\n\n1. The mutex error cause and why it happens\n2. The architectural decision to use HTTP for hook-daemon communication\n3. Which components use sqlite-vec and which don't\n4. The port number for HTTP communication\n5. The new HTTP endpoints available\n\nLet me structure these as memories:\n\nMemory 1: Mutex Lock Failed Error Root Cause\n- Subject: Mutex lock failed error occurs when threads lock destroyed mutexes\n- Keywords: mutex, sqlite-vec, threading, error, invalid-argument\n- Applies_to: global\n- Content: Details about the error and root cause\n\n\n- Insights: The error stems from complex threading interactions in sqlite-vec's C++ implementation\n\nI'll focus on the next memory about the hook-daemon architecture. The core insight is creating a communication layer that isolates hooks from direct database access. This approach prevents threading complications by centralizing database interactions in a single daemon process. The HTTP-based communication ensures clean separation of concerns, with hooks acting as lightweight clients requesting data or performing actions through well-defined endpoints.\n\nThe session-start hook represents a specific example of this safety approach. By avoiding direct sqlite-vec interactions and instead reading markdown files through a memory management system, it sidesteps potential mutex-related threading issues entirely.\n\nThe architectural shift introduces a more robust, scalable approach to managing database interactions across the application, with clear boundaries between components and reduced risk of concurrent access problems.\n\n## Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"memories\": [\n    {\n      \"subject\": \"Mutex lock failed error caused by destroyed mutex in sqlite-vec\",\n      \"keywords\": [\n        \"mutex\",\n        \"sqlite-vec\",\n        \"threading\",\n        \"error\",\n        \"invalid-argument\",\n        \"pthread\"\n      ],\n      \"applies_to\": \"global\",\n      \"content\": \"The 'mutex lock failed: Invalid argument' error (EINVAL from pthread_mutex_lock) occurs when a thread attempts to lock a mutex that has already been destroyed.

When processes exit, Node.js garbage collects objects in unpredictable order, and sqlite-vec mutexes could be destroyed while cleanup code was still trying to use them.\n\n2. **Solution implemented**: Refactored vector stores to use ephemeral connections instead of singletons. Each operation creates a fresh database connection, performs the operation, and closes immediately. This prevents connections from being held across operations.\n\n3. **Bug found in SearchEngine**: When using the legacy constructor `SearchEngine(memoryManager)`, the SearchEngine wasn't passing the MemoryManager's baseDir to the vector store, causing it to use `config.memoryDir` instead. This broke when ephemeral connections were used.\n\n4. **Architecture pattern**: The fix involved:\n   - Removing singleton pattern from vector stores\n   - Making database connections ephemeral (created and destroyed per operation)\n   - Ensuring SearchEngine passes the correct baseDir to vector stores\n   - Added getter to MemoryManager to expose baseDir\n\n5. **Specific file details**:\n   - `src/core/vector-store.ts` - Changed to ephemeral connections\n   - `src/core/thinking-vector-store.ts` - Changed to ephemeral connections\n   - `src/core/search.ts` - Updated to pass baseDir from MemoryManager\n   - `src/core/thinking-search.ts` - Updated similarly\n\n6. **Testing outcome**: All 289 tests pass after the changes\n\n7. **Threading/mutex insight**: sqlite-vec uses internal mutexes that are sensitive to connection persistence and timing of object destruction.

The vector store is mocked, but the memoryManager is real.\n\nThe issue is that the searchByScope method calls `this.memoryManager.listMemories()`, but the test is failing because it's using a mock. Wait, let me re-check the error message:\n\n```\nTypeError: this.memoryManager.listMemories is not a function\n```\n\nThis suggests the memoryManager is not being passed correctly. Let me check how the SearchEngine is being constructed in the test - it's `searchEngine = new SearchEngine(memoryManager);` which looks correct.\n\nWait, the mock is for the vector store, not the memoryManager. The memoryManager is a real instance created from MemoryManager.

When the SearchEngine calls `getVectorStore()`, it gets the mocked version. \n\nI suspect the mock might be interfering with the actual memoryManager instance. The test creates a real memoryManager, but something in the mocking process is replacing or altering its methods. This could explain why `listMemories` is not recognized as a function, even though the original instance should have this method.\n\nThe problem likely stems from how the mocking is configured, potentially overwriting the entire memoryManager object or its prototype chain in a way that strips out its original methods.\n\nI'll need to carefully examine the mocking setup to ensure it's only targeting the vector-store module and not inadvertently affecting the MemoryManager implementation.\n\n## Output\n\nThe searchByScope and getRelevantForSession tests should work since they use the real memoryManager.

Let me go with `nomic-embed-text` as it's the recommended default and has good quality.\n\nActually, looking at Ollama's documentation:\n- `nomic-embed-text` - 768 dimensions, 274MB - good quality\n- `all-minilm` - 384 dimensions, 46MB - smallest, fast\n- `mxbai-embed-large` - 1024 dimensions, 669MB - best quality\n\nFor \"best & fastest while very small\", I'd say `nomic-embed-text` is the best balance. It's become the de facto standard for Ollama embeddings. But since user wants \"very small\", maybe `all-minilm` is better.\n\nLet me go with `nomic-embed-text` as it's the recommended one with good quality, and make the model configurable.\n\nNow let me update the embedding service to use Ollama's HTTP API:\n- POST http://localhost:11434/api/embed\n- Body: { \"model\": \"nomic-embed-text\", \"input\": \"text to embed\" }\n\nThe API returns:\n```json\n{\n  \"embeddings\": [[0.1, 0.2, ...]],\n  \"model\": \"nomic-embed-text\"\n}\n```\n\nLet me now update the embedding service:\n\n## Output\n\nNow I have a clear picture.

Let me analyze what was learned and discovered in this session.\n\nLooking at the transcript, this session was about fixing a \"mutex lock failed: Invalid argument\" error in the local-recall project. Here's what was discovered and solved:\n\n## What was learned:\n\n1. **Root cause of the mutex error**: The singleton pattern with persistent database connections combined with sqlite-vec's internal mutexes was causing the error. When the process exits, Node.js garbage collects objects unpredictably, and sqlite-vec mutexes could be destroyed while cleanup code was still using them.\n\n2. **The solution**: Move to ephemeral connections - create fresh database connections for each atomic operation instead of holding singleton connections.\n\n3. **Specific threading issue**: The sqlite-vec native extension uses internal mutexes that don't play well with persistent connections across the hook execution lifecycle.\n\n4. **Related issue with SearchEngine**: The SearchEngine wasn't passing the baseDir to getVectorStore(), which masked the issue with the singleton pattern. Now that connections are ephemeral, each call needs the correct baseDir.\n\n5. **Architecture pattern**: The local-recall system uses Orama (pure JavaScript) for vector storage and sqlite-vec for the backend. The issue was in how connections were managed.\n\n6. **Important discovery**: The old singleton pattern masked connection path issues - when using the legacy constructor `SearchEngine(memoryManager)`, the SearchEngine needs to know the MemoryManager's baseDir to create connections in the right location.\n\n## Code changes made:\n\n1. **`src/core/vector-store.ts`**: Refactored to use ephemeral connections instead of singletons\n2. **`src/core/thinking-vector-store.ts`**: Same refactoring for thinking vector store\n3. **`src/core/memory.ts`**: Added a getter to expose baseDir\n4. **`src/core/search.ts`**: Updated to pass baseDir when creating SearchEngine from MemoryManager\n\n\n5. **`src/core/thinking-search.ts`**: Implemented similar connection management updates for thinking search components\n\nI'll focus on the key modifications to the thinking search module, ensuring consistent ephemeral connection handling across the system's memory management infrastructure.\n\nThe sqlite-vec extension presents challenges with connection persistence, particularly around mutex implementations and process lifecycle interactions. Constructor-based initialization requires careful baseDir configuration to prevent connection leakage and ensure proper isolation between memory operations.\n\nRigorous testing with custom path configurations will be critical for identifying and mitigating potential connection management vulnerabilities.\n\n## Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"memories\": [\n    {\n      \"subject\": \"Mutex lock error caused by persistent sqlite-vec connections - solved with ephemeral connections\",\n      \"keywords\": [\"mutex\", \"sqlite-vec\", \"threading\", \"database connection\", \"garbage collection\", \"singleton\", \"error handling\"],\n      \"applies_to\": \"global\",\n      \"content\": \"## Problem\\n\\nThe error `libc++abi: terminating due to uncaught exception of type std::__1::system_error: mutex lock failed: Invalid argument` occurred in UserPromptSubmit hook because:\\n\\n1. **Persistent singleton connections**: `getVectorStore()` and `getThinkingVectorStore()` created singleton instances with database connections that persisted for the process lifetime\\n2. **sqlite-vec native extension mutexes**: The sqlite-vec extension uses internal mutexes that don't safely handle persistent connections\\n3. **Unpredictable garbage collection**: When the process exits, Node.js garbage collects objects in an unpredictable order, causing mutexes to be destroyed while cleanup code was still trying to acquire them\\n\\n## Solution\\n\\nRefactored both `vector-store.ts` and `thinking-vector-store.ts` to use **ephemeral connections**:\\n- Each atomic operation (add, remove, search, sync, etc.) creates a fresh database connection\\n- Connections are closed immediately after the operation completes\\n- No singleton pattern - each call to `getVectorStore()` returns a new instance with its own connection\\n\\n## Files Modified\\n\\n- `src/core/vector-store.ts` - Refactored to ephemeral connections\\n- `src/core/thinking-vector-store.ts` - Same ephemeral connection pattern\\n- `src/core/search.ts` - Now receives baseDir to pass to getVectorStore()\\n- `src/core/thinking-search.ts` - Same update for thinking search\\n- `src/core/memory.ts` - Added getBaseDir() getter\\n\\n## Key Insight\\n\\nThe old singleton pattern masked an additional issue: SearchEngine wasn't passing baseDir to getVectorStore(), so it defaulted to the global config.memoryDir instead of using the same directory as the MemoryManager.

The issue is that each call to `getVectorStore()` now creates a NEW instance, so the data doesn't persist across different instances - each vector store instance creates its own connection to the database and closes it.\n\nBut wait - that should be fine since they all connect to the same SQLite database file. The database file persists the data. Let me think about this...\n\nOh! The issue is that the tests are expecting data to be found immediately after being added. With ephemeral connections:\n1. Memory is created, added to vector store, connection closed2. Search is performed with a new vector store instance, new connection opened\n\nThat SHOULD work because the data is persisted in the SQLite file. But looking at the test failures:\n\n1. \"should make new memories searchable via vector search\" - getting a different ID suggests there's existing data in the test dir or something else is going on\n2. \"expected false to be true\" - this usually means the memory isn't being found\n\nLooking at my changes, I removed the `this.db` persistent storage but the flow should be:1. `add()` opens connection, does insert, closes connection\n2. `search()` opens connection, does query, closes connection\n\nBoth should hit the same SQLite file.

The method handles different input types and falls back to default configurations.

The config loads from `process.cwd()` and the `LOCAL_RECALL_DIR` environment variable gives the memory directory path.

The MCP server uses `process.cwd()` as the project path (default in MemoryExtractor)\n2. But `LOCAL_RECALL_DIR` might be relative like `./local-recall`\n3.

I need to analyze the condensed transcript and extract valuable memories that would help future AI assistants working on this codebase.\n\nLet me go through the transcript to identify what was learned, what problems were solved, and what is specific to this codebase:\n\n1. **The Mutex Error Issue**:\n   - The error \"libc++abi: terminating due to uncaught exception of type std::__1::system_error: mutex lock failed: Invalid argument\" was happening\n   - Root cause: A thread attempting to lock a mutex that has already been destroyed\n   - This was related to sqlite-vec using internal C++ mutexes\n   - The original architecture had Orama being used directly in hooks, but there was a switch to using better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec\n\n2. **Architecture Change**:\n   - The problem: Hooks and daemon were completely independent, with hooks directly using sqlite-vec (which has the mutex issue)\n   - The solution: Implement an HTTP API in the daemon so hooks become thin clients\n   - This moves the sqlite-vec database access into a single daemon process, avoiding mutex issues\n\n3. **Implementation Details**:\n   - New file: `src/mcp-server/http-server.ts` - HTTP server in the daemon\n   - New file: `src/utils/daemon-client.ts` - Client library for hooks to communicate with daemon\n   - Modified files: `src/hooks/user-prompt-submit.ts`, `src/hooks/session-start.ts`, `src/mcp-server/server.ts`\n   - HTTP endpoints: `/search/episodic`, `/search/thinking`, `/memories/recent`, `/health`\n   - Default port: 7847 (changed from 3000 to something more random)\n\n4. **Session-start Hook Insight**:\n   - The session-start hook doesn't need sqlite-vec - it just reads markdown files directly\n   - But was updated anyway to use the daemon client for consistency\n   \nI'll continue the rewrite with the next thinking:\n\nThe build process validated the architectural changes, with all 289 tests passing successfully. The core insight involves centralizing database access to resolve threading complexities. By moving sqlite-vec operations into a single daemon process, the system eliminates mutex-related failures. The configuration remains flexible, using Zod schemas for type safety and allowing configurable port settings. This approach transforms hooks into lightweight clients, simplifying the overall system architecture and improving reliability.\n\nThe HTTP-based inter-process communication provides a clean separation of concerns, with the daemon managing critical database interactions while hooks remain focused on specific tasks like reading markdown files and submitting user prompts.\n\nThe API design centralizes vector search operations across episodic and thinking memories through dedicated endpoints, ensuring thread-safe database access by routing all queries through a single daemon process. This approach eliminates mutex lock conflicts and simplifies the overall system architecture.\n\nBy using port 7847, the daemon selects a non-standard port that minimizes potential conflicts with other services, while maintaining flexibility through environment variable configuration.\n\nThe session-start hook demonstrates a lightweight, file-based memory loading strategy that prioritizes performance and simplicity, leveraging markdown files directly without complex database interactions.\n\nThe daemon client provides a clean, abstracted HTTP communication layer for system hooks, handling request complexities like timeouts and health checks while maintaining a consistent interface across different components.\n\nThe comprehensive test suite validation confirms the robustness of the new IPC architecture, with all 289 tests passing successfully and indicating production-readiness.\n\n## Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"memories\": [\n    {\n      \"subject\": \"Mutex lock failed error fixed by centralizing sqlite-vec database access in daemon\",\n      \"keywords\": [\"mutex\", \"sqlite-vec\", \"threading\", \"daemon\", \"hooks\", \"ipc\", \"error\", \"concurrent access\"],\n      \"applies_to\": \"global\",\n      \"content\": \"## Problem\\nHooks were directly accessing sqlite-vec database, causing 'mutex lock failed: Invalid argument' errors due to concurrent access from multiple hook processes destroying/recreating mutexes.\\n\\n## Root Cause\\nMultiple hook processes simultaneously accessing the sqlite-vec database with internal C++ mutexes led to mutex state corruption when threads tried to lock already-destroyed mutexes.\\n\\n## Solution\\nImplemented hook-daemon IPC architecture:\\n- Daemon owns the single sqlite-vec database connection\\n- Hooks communicate via HTTP API to daemon\\n- Eliminates concurrent database access conflicts\\n- All 289 tests pass after implementation\\n\\n## Architecture\\n```\\nHook 1 ──┐\\nHook 2 ──┼→ HTTP → Daemon (port 7847) → sqlite-vec\\nHook 3 ──┘\\n```\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"subject\": \"Daemon HTTP API endpoints for centralized vector search\",\n      \"keywords\": [\"http\", \"endpoints\", \"daemon\", \"api\", \"episodic\", \"thinking\", \"search\", \"recent\"],\n      \"applies_to\": \"file:src/mcp-server/http-server.ts\",\n      \"content\": \"## Daemon HTTP Server\\n\\nListens on port 7847 and exposes:\\n- `POST /search/episodic` - Episodic memory vector search\\n- `POST /search/thinking` - Thinking memory vector search  \\n- `POST /memories/recent` - Get recent memories\\n- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint\\n\\nHooks use `DaemonClient` (src/utils/daemon-client.ts) to call these endpoints instead of directly accessing sqlite-vec database.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"subject\": \"Daemon HTTP port is configurable via environment and config file\",\n      \"keywords\": [\"port\", \"7847\", \"configuration\", \"environment\", \"mcp\"],\n      \"applies_to\": \"file:src/core/types.ts\",\n      \"content\": \"## Port Configuration\\n\\nDefault daemon port: 7847 (random port in 7xxx range to avoid conflicts)\\n\\nConfigurable via:\\n- Env: `LOCAL_RECALL_DAEMON_PORT`\\n- Config: `.local-recall.json` → `mcp.daemonPort`\\n- Schema: MCP object in `src/core/types.ts` with Zod validation\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"subject\": \"Session-start hook reads markdown files directly, doesn't need database\",\n      \"keywords\": [\"session-start\", \"hook\", \"markdown\", \"memory-manager\", \"no-database\"],\n      \"applies_to\": \"file:src/hooks/session-start.ts\",\n      \"content\": \"## Session-Start Hook\\n\\nLoads recent memories from markdown files using `MemoryManager` - no vector search or database access needed.

The hooks ARE working for this current session (I saw \"SessionStart:Callback hook success: Success\" in my system reminder at the start of this conversation)2. The transcripts I'm looking at might not have `hook_response` recorded - maybe Claude Code doesn't write those to transcripts, or they're written differently\n3.

Each operation is self-contained:\n1. Open connection\n2. Do work\n3. Close connection in `finally` block\n\nAll 289 tests pass.","timestamp":"2025-12-21T19:27:13.359Z"}

The test sets `process.env['LOCAL_RECALL_DIR'] = testDir` before creating the managers.\n\nThe issue is likely that:\n1. Test sets `process.env['LOCAL_RECALL_DIR'] = testDir`\n2. Test creates `MemoryManager(testDir)` - uses testDir explicitly\n3. Test creates `SearchEngine(memoryManager)` - legacy constructor\n4. SearchEngine.search() calls `getVectorStore({ readonly: this.readonly })` with no baseDir\n5. VectorStore constructor uses `config.memoryDir` which comes from `getConfig()`\n6. But `getConfig()` uses the cached config which may have been initialized before the test set the env var\n\nActually wait, the tests do call `resetVectorStore()` before each test, and each test sets the env var... but the config is a singleton that may have been loaded with a different value.\n\nLet me check - when `getVectorStore({ readonly: true })` is called, it creates a new VectorStore with `baseDir: undefined`, which means VectorStore constructor does `this.baseDir = options.baseDir ?? config.memoryDir`.\n\nIf the config was loaded before the env var was set, or if the cached config hasn't been updated, the VectorStore might be using a different directory.\n\nActually, looking more closely at the code flow:\n1. Test: `process.env['LOCAL_RECALL_DIR'] = testDir`2. Test: `memoryManager = new MemoryManager(testDir)` - explicitly passes testDir3. Test: `searchEngine = new SearchEngine(memoryManager)` - passes memoryManager\n4. SearchEngine constructor: Uses the memoryManager but also has `this.readonly = false`\n5. When `searchEngine.search()` is called, it does `getVectorStore({ readonly: this.readonly })` with no baseDir\n\n\n6. VectorStore constructor: `this.baseDir = options.baseDir ?? config.memoryDir`\n7. If `config.memoryDir` wasn't updated to `testDir`, the VectorStore uses the wrong directory!\n\nI realize the core problem is a configuration synchronization issue. The VectorStore retrieval mechanism doesn't consistently propagate the test directory across different method calls. When searching, it falls back to the potentially stale configuration, which might not reflect the current test environment's intended directory path.\n\nThe mechanism breaks down because the search operation doesn't explicitly pass the base directory, instead relying on a potentially outdated global configuration. This subtle discrepancy means tests could inadvertently use incorrect storage locations, leading to unpredictable behavior.\n\nI need to ensure the base directory context is consistently maintained throughout different method invocations, particularly between memory management and search operations. The solution requires explicitly passing the base directory context during vector store retrieval.\n\nThe previous singleton implementation inadvertently concealed a potential configuration mismatch by always returning the initially created vector store instance. This meant that subsequent calls would ignore changes in base directory or configuration settings, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in test scenarios.\n\nThe key observation is that the vector store initialization needs to respect the specific base directory context of each method call, rather than relying on a static, globally shared instance.\n\nTo resolve this, I'll modify the SearchEngine to explicitly pass the base directory from the MemoryManager, ensuring each vector store is created with the correct configuration context.\n\n## Output\n\nI found the issue! The `SearchEngine.search()` method calls `getVectorStore({ readonly: this.readonly })` without passing the `baseDir`, so it uses `config.memoryDir` from the global config instead of the same directory as the `MemoryManager`.\n\nThe old singleton pattern masked this - the first call to `getVectorStore()` would set the baseDir, and subsequent calls returned the same instance. With ephemeral instances, each call needs the correct baseDir.\n\nLet me fix the `SearchEngine` to pass the correct baseDir:","timestamp":"2025-12-21T19:27:13.360Z"}

Let me provide a good summary for the user.\n\n## Output\n\n## Local Recall Hooks Overview\n\nThis project has **three hooks** that integrate with Claude Code to provide persistent memory across sessions:\n\n### 1. SessionStart Hook (`src/hooks/session-start.ts`)\n\n**Triggered:** When a Claude Code session begins\n\n**What it does:**\n- Loads the memory index from `local-recall/index.json`\n- Searches for relevant memories based on context (files, areas)\n- Outputs memories to stdout, which gets injected into Claude's context\n- Shows index stats (total memories, keywords, last indexed time)\n\n**Timeout:** 30 seconds\n\n**Key behaviors:**\n- Uses `cwd` from stdin or falls back to `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` env var\n- Can filter by `LOCAL_RECALL_CONTEXT_FILES` and `LOCAL_RECALL_CONTEXT_AREA` env vars\n- Always exits 0 to avoid blocking sessions, even on errors\n\n---\n\n### 2. UserPromptSubmit Hook (`src/hooks/user-prompt-submit.ts`)\n\n**Triggered:** When user submits a prompt, before Claude processes it\n\n**What it does:**\n1. Extracts keywords from the user's prompt using `keyword-extractor`\n2. Filters keywords (>2 chars, max 10)\n3. Searches memory index with fuzzy matching\n4. Returns up to 5 relevant memories with match scores\n\n**Timeout:** 30 seconds\n\n**Example output:**\n```\n# Local Recall: Relevant Memories\nFound 3 memories related to your query.\n\n[Memory content]\n*Match score: 85% | Keywords: typescript, config*\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Stop Hook (`src/hooks/stop.ts`)\n\n**Triggered:** When Claude stops processing (end of response)\n\n**What it does:**\n1. Reads the transcript file (JSONL format from `transcript_path`)\n2. Parses transcript using `parseTranscriptForMemories()` to find memory-worthy content\n3. Creates new memory files via `MemoryManager`\n4. Refreshes the index\n\n**Timeout:** 60 seconds (longer because it writes files)\n\n**Key behaviors:**\n- Logs created memory count to stderr\n- Rebuilds the index after creating memories\n- This is where new memories get persisted\n\n---\n\n### Hook Configuration (`hooks.json`)\n\nAll hooks use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` to reference bundled scripts, making the plugin portable:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"SessionStart\": [{ \"command\": \"node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/hooks/session-start.js\" }],\n    \"UserPromptSubmit\": [{ \"command\": \"node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/hooks/user-prompt-submit.js\" }],\n    \"Stop\": [{ \"command\": \"node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/hooks/stop.js\" }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Data Flow\n\n```\nSessionStart → Load existing memories into context\n     ↓\nUserPromptSubmit → Add relevant memories based on user query\n     ↓\nClaude processes request\n     ↓\nStop → Parse transcript, create new memories\n```","timestamp":"2025-12-21T19:27:13.363Z"}

Let me create a detailed plan for your confirmation.\n\n## Architecture Plan: Thinking-Memories Index\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate a parallel \"thinking-memories\" system that extracts Claude's thinking blocks from transcripts for semantic search and context injection.\n\n### Key Differences from Current Memories\n\n| Aspect | Current Memories | Thinking Memories |\n|--------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Source | Full transcript → Claude extraction | Only `thinking` blocks |\n| Keywords | Required (1-20) | **Omitted** |\n| Location | `local-recall/episodic-memory/` | `local-recall/thinking-memories/` |\n| SQLite Tables | `memories`, `memory_embeddings` | `thinking_memories`, `thinking_embeddings` |\n| Parallelism | 5 concurrent | **20 concurrent** |\n| Hook Output | \"Relevant Memories\" | **\"Previous Thoughts\"** |\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n#### 1. New Types (`src/core/types.ts`)\n```typescript\ninterface ThinkingMemoryFrontmatter {\n  id: string;                    // UUID\n  subject: string;               // Brief description (1-200 chars)\n  // NO keywords field\n  applies_to: MemoryScope;       // 'global' | 'file:...' | 'area:...'\n  occurred_at: string;           // ISO-8601 timestamp\n  content_hash: string;          // SHA-256 prefix (16 chars)\n}\n\ninterface ThinkingMemory extends ThinkingMemoryFrontmatter {\n  content: string;\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. New File Storage\n- **Location**: `local-recall/thinking-memories/`\n- **Format**: Same markdown with YAML frontmatter (minus keywords)\n- **Update**: `src/utils/gitignore.ts` to handle new directory\n\n#### 3. New SQLite Tables (in existing `memory.sqlite`)\n```sql\n-- Metadata table (no keywords column)\nCREATE TABLE thinking_memories (\n  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n  subject TEXT NOT NULL,\n  applies_to TEXT NOT NULL,\n  occurred_at TEXT NOT NULL,\n  content_hash TEXT NOT NULL,\n  content TEXT NOT NULL\n);\n\n-- Vector embeddings (same structure)\nCREATE VIRTUAL TABLE thinking_embeddings USING vec0(\n  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n  embedding float[384]\n);\n\n-- Indexes\nCREATE INDEX idx_thinking_memories_occurred_at ON thinking_memories(occurred_at DESC);\nCREATE INDEX idx_thinking_memories_applies_to ON thinking_memories(applies_to);\n```\n\n#### 4. New Core Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `src/core/thinking-memory.ts` | CRUD operations for thinking memory files |\n| `src/core/thinking-vector-store.ts` | Vector store methods for thinking memories (or extend existing) |\n| `src/core/thinking-extractor.ts` | Extract thinking blocks, 20-file parallel processing |\n| `src/core/thinking-processed-log.ts` | Track processed transcripts (separate log file) |\n\n#### 5. Thinking Extractor Design (`src/core/thinking-extractor.ts`)\n\n```\nTranscriptCollector.listLocalTranscripts()\n    ↓\nFor each transcript (20 in parallel):\n    ↓\nThinkingProcessedLog.needsProcessing()\n    ↓ (check content hash)\n    ↓\nparseTranscript() → extract all ThinkingContent blocks\n    ↓\nFor each thinking block:\n    - Generate subject from first ~100 chars\n    - Determine applies_to from context\n    - Create ThinkingMemory\n    ↓\nThinkingMemoryManager.createMemory()\n    ↓\nThinkingVectorStore.add()\n    ↓\nThinkingProcessedLog.recordProcessed()\n```\n\n**Key difference**: No Claude API call needed - thinking blocks are used directly as content.\n\n#### 6. New UserPromptSubmit Hook (`src/hooks/user-prompt-submit-thinking.ts`)\n\n- Performs semantic search on `thinking_memories` table\n- Injects results as \"Previous Thoughts\" section:\n\n```markdown\n# Local Recall: Previous Thoughts\n\nFound X relevant thinking excerpts.\n\n## Thought Subject\n**ID:** uuid\n**Scope:** applies_to\n**Occurred:** timestamp\n\n---\nThinking content here...\n*Similarity: XX%*\n---\n```\n\n#### 7. Hook Configuration Update\n\nAdd to `.claude/settings.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"UserPromptSubmit\": [\n      {\n        \"hooks\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"command\",\n            \"command\": \"node ./dist/hooks/user-prompt-submit.js\",\n            \"timeout\": 30\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"command\", \n            \"command\": \"node ./dist/hooks/user-prompt-submit-thinking.js\",\n            \"timeout\": 30\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 8. File Structure (New Files)\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── core/\n│   ├── thinking-memory.ts           # NEW: CRUD for thinking memories\n│   ├── thinking-vector-store.ts     # NEW: Vector store for thinking\n│   ├── thinking-extractor.ts        # NEW: Extract thinking blocks (20 parallel)\n│   └── thinking-processed-log.ts    # NEW: Track processed transcripts\n├── hooks/\n│   └── user-prompt-submit-thinking.ts  # NEW: Inject \"previous thoughts\"\n└── prompts/\n    └── thinking-subject-extraction.ts  # NEW: Generate subjects (optional)\n```\n\n#### 9. MCP Tools (Optional Extension)\n- `thinking_memory_search` - Search thinking memories\n- `thinking_memory_list` - List thinking memories\n- `thinking_index_rebuild` - Rebuild thinking memory index\n\n---\n\n### Questions Before Implementation\n\n1. **Subject generation**: Should I use Claude to generate a concise subject from each thinking block, or derive it automatically (first N characters, truncated)?\n\n2. **applies_to scope**: Should all thinking memories be `global`, or should I try to infer scope from the transcript context (e.g., which files were being discussed)?\n\n3. **Deduplication**: Should thinking memories be deduplicated by content hash alone, or also consider the transcript they came from?\n\n4. **MCP tools**: Do you want MCP tools exposed for thinking memories, or just the hook injection?\n\n5. **Integration**: Should the existing UserPromptSubmit hook be modified to also search thinking memories, or keep them as completely separate hooks?\n\n---\n\nDo you want me to proceed with this plan? Please confirm or let me know any adjustments.","timestamp":"2025-12-21T19:27:13.368Z"}

The file-based locking with proper-lockfile isn't working because the ONNX mutex errors happen at a lower level.\n\nPossible alternatives:\n\n1. **Use a different embedding library** that doesn't have mutex issues - maybe one that's pure JavaScript or handles concurrency better\n\n2. **Pre-compute embeddings** - don't generate embeddings at query time in hooks. Instead:\n   - Store embeddings in the Orama index (already happening)\n   - At query time, use text-based search or a simpler similarity approach that doesn't require loading the model\n\n3. **Use a remote embedding API** - like OpenAI embeddings or a local server\n\n4. **Transformers.js** - This is a pure JavaScript/WASM implementation that might not have the same mutex issues\n\n5. **Disable vector search in hooks** - Fall back to keyword/text search when called from hooks, only use vector search from the MCP server (which is a singleton anyway)\n\nLet me think about the simplest fix. The user wants to run multiple Claude instances, each with their own hooks running. The problem is the embedding model loading.\n\nOption 5 seems most practical - the hooks could do simpler text-based search (keywords, subject matching) instead of vector search. The MCP server (which runs as a singleton per Claude instance) can still do vector search when explicitly called.\n\nActually, wait - each Claude instance has its own MCP server, so vector search via MCP tools should work fine. The issue is specifically the hooks running concurrently.\n\nLet me check if there's a way to do search without embeddings - maybe using Orama's text search capabilities instead of vector search for the hooks.\n\n## Output\n\nGood point. Each Claude instance needs its own hooks, and they'd all conflict on a shared daemon.\n\n**Alternative approaches:**\n\n1. **Text-based search in hooks** - Use Orama's text search (no embeddings) instead of vector search for hooks. MCP tools can still use vectors.\n\n2. **Different embedding library** - `transformers.js` is pure WASM, might not have mutex issues\n\n3. **Disable hook search entirely** - Only search via MCP tools (each Claude instance has its own MCP server)\n\n4. **Pre-computed embeddings only** - Hooks search the existing Orama index without generating new query embeddings (requires a different search approach)\n\nWhich direction do you prefer? Option 1 (text search in hooks) would be the quickest to implement and still provide useful results.","timestamp":"2025-12-21T19:27:13.373Z"}

The issue must be with how `searchByKeywords` works - let me check the search. The log shows that a search for \"sausages stew\" returned 0 results, but there are clearly memories with those keywords.Looking at the `searchByKeywords` method in search.ts, I see it uses Fuse.js for fuzzy matching. The issue might be that the fuzzy threshold is set too high - the keywords need to exactly match. Let me check the fuzzy threshold and test with a lower threshold. Actually, in the search code:\n\n```typescript\nconst fuse = new Fuse(allKeywords, {\n  threshold: 1 - threshold, // Fuse uses 0 = exact, 1 = match anything\n  includeScore: true,\n});\n```\n\nIf `threshold` from config is 0.6 (60% match), then `1 - 0.6 = 0.4` is passed to Fuse. In Fuse.js, lower threshold means stricter matching (0 = exact, 1 = anything). So a threshold of 0.4 should match \"sausages\" exactly.\n\nWait, but the keywords should be exact matches in this case. Let me trace through what's happening...\n\nActually, the issue might be that when I run the test with `cwd` pointing to the local-recall project itself, it's looking in `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/local-recall` for the memories, which is where they are. And the index does have \"sausages\" as a keyword...\n\nLet me look more closely at the search code again. The issue might be in how the results are processed. Let me also check if the config is being loaded properly.\n\nLet me run a simpler test to see what's happening.\n\n## Output\n\nInteresting - the index has \"sausages\" and \"stew\" keywords.

Looking at the code:\n\n1. **The migration logic** (in `migration.ts`) says it should detect markdown files and migrate them to JSONL, then delete the markdown files.\n\n2. **The JSONL stores** (`episodic-jsonl-store.ts` and `thinking-jsonl-store.ts`) are supposed to only write to JSONL files, not markdown.\n\n3. **The migration check** only happens if there are NO JSONL files but markdown files exist. Looking at line 122:\n   ```javascript\n   episodicNeedsMigration: episodicMdFiles.length > 0 && !episodicHasJsonl,\n   ```\n   \n   This means: once JSONL files exist, migration won't run, even if there are still markdown files!\n\nThe issue is: the markdown files already exist alongside JSONL files, so the migration check says \"no migration needed\" (because JSONL files exist). The markdown files aren't being deleted because the migration thinks it's already done.\n\nLooking at the git status, I can see both:\n- `?? local-recall/episodic-000001.jsonl`\n- `?? local-recall/episodic-memory/07b6a673-62c3-4a7a-ae7f-134e754a6a52.md`\n\nWait - looking more carefully at the file paths in git status:\n- JSONL files are in the root: `local-recall/episodic-000001.jsonl`\n- Markdown files are in subdirs: `local-recall/episodic-memory/07b6a673-*.md`\n\nBut looking at `episodic-jsonl-store.ts:82`:\n```javascript\n// JSONL files go in the episodic-memory subdirectory\nthis.storeDir = path.join(this.baseDir, EPISODIC_SUBDIR);\n\n\n```\n\nI see a discrepancy between where JSONL files should be stored and where they're actually being created. The code suggests JSONL files should be in the `episodic-memory` subdirectory, but they're being written to the root directory instead. This misalignment is likely causing the migration process to fail silently.\n\nI'll investigate the file locations and potential reasons for this mismatch, checking both the migration logic and the file writing mechanisms to understand why the files aren't being placed in the expected subdirectory.\n\n```\nThe git status reveals multiple JSONL files at the root level, including numbered and non-numbered versions of episodic and thinking files. The presence of markdown files in the memory subdirectories suggests a potential configuration or migration issue with file placement.\n\nI'll examine the `jsonl-store.ts` to trace the file path logic and determine why files are being written to the root instead of the expected subdirectories.\n```\n\n## Output\n\nI see the issue now.

Let me check the migration logic again:\n\nFrom `migration.ts:120-123`:\n```javascript\n// Need migration if we have markdown files and no JSONL files\nepisodicNeedsMigration: episodicMdFiles.length > 0 && !episodicHasJsonl,\n```\n\nThis says: \"only migrate if markdown exists AND no JSONL exists.\" Since JSONL now exists, migration won't run again, so the markdown files just stay there.\n\nThe problem is: the migration service is supposed to delete markdown files AFTER successful migration (lines 172-179), but apparently something went wrong or the migration ran partially.\n\nLet me look at what the user actually expects. Looking at the git status at the beginning:\n- The untracked files shown are in `/Users/joe/Code/Syntessera/local-recall/local-recall/episodic-memory/*.md`\n\nThese are OLD markdown files that should have been deleted during migration. The new memories should only be created in JSONL format.\n\nBut wait - looking at the timestamps of those markdown files (`21 Dec 19:27`, `19:28`, `19:29`), these are VERY recent. And the JSONL files are from similar times (`21 Dec 19:27`).\n\nSo either:\n1. The markdown files are being recreated somehow after migration\n2. Or the migration never properly deleted them\n\nLet me search for where markdown files might still be getting created:\n\n## Output\n\nI see it now. There are JSONL files in `episodic-memory/` **alongside** the markdown files. The migration condition prevents re-running because JSONL exists, but the markdown files weren't cleaned up.\n\nBut looking at the timestamps (all from today `21 Dec 19:27-29`), it seems like markdown files are still being **created** after the migration.

Let me analyze what was learned and discovered:\n\n## What was learned:\n\n1. **Root Cause of Mutex Error**: The \"mutex lock failed: Invalid argument\" error occurs when a thread attempts to lock a mutex that has already been destroyed. This is a threading issue in native code (C++) within sqlite-vec or similar native dependencies.\n\n2. **Architecture Problem Identified**: The original architecture had hooks and daemon running independently with no communication, both trying to access sqlite-vec directly, causing mutex contention/destruction issues.\n\n3. **Solution Implemented**: Changed to a hook-daemon communication architecture where:\n   - The daemon runs an HTTP server\n   - Hooks become thin clients that call the daemon's HTTP endpoints\n   - Only the daemon accesses sqlite-vec, eliminating concurrent access from multiple processes\n\n4. **Session-Start Hook Safety**: The session-start hook doesn't use sqlite-vec - it only reads markdown files via MemoryManager, so it wasn't causing the mutex issue.\n\n5. **HTTP Server Architecture**: The daemon now exposes:\n   - `POST /search/episodic` - Vector search for episodic memories\n   - `POST /search/thinking` - Vector search for thinking memories\n   - `POST /memories/recent` - Get recent memories\n   - `GET /health` - Health check endpoint\n\n6. **Port Configuration**: The HTTP server port was changed from 3000 to a random port in the 7xxx range (7847) to avoid conflicts.\n\n7. **New Files Created**:\n   - `src/mcp-server/http-server.ts` - HTTP server module\n   - `src/utils/daemon-client.ts` - HTTP client for hooks\n\n## Specific to the codebase:\n\n- The project uses better-sqlite3 with sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity search\n- The hooks (user-prompt-submit and session-start) are thin processes that execute frequently\n\n\n- The daemon operates as a centralized process to manage database interactions, preventing concurrent access conflicts\n\nI've identified key architectural improvements that resolve threading complexities. The solution transforms the system's design by introducing a single, controlled access point for database operations through an HTTP-based daemon. This approach isolates hooks, prevents mutex destruction, and creates a more robust communication mechanism between system components.\n\n## Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"memories\": [\n    {\n      \"subject\": \"Mutex lock failed error caused by multi-process sqlite-vec access\",\n      \"keywords\": [\"mutex\", \"sqlite-vec\", \"threading\", \"error\", \"pthread\", \"Invalid argument\"],\n      \"applies_to\": \"global\",\n      \"content\": \"The 'mutex lock failed: Invalid argument' error (std::__1::system_error) occurs when a thread attempts to lock a mutex that has already been destroyed.

Let me analyze what was learned, discovered, and solved:\n\n1. **The Problem**: \n   - sqlite-vec was causing mutex errors when multiple processes tried to access it\n   - The error was \"mutex lock failed: Invalid argument\" \n   - This was happening in hooks which were trying to open the database in read-only mode for queries\n   - SQLite was running in multi-thread mode (THREADSAFE=2) instead of serialized mode\n\n2. **Root Cause Analysis**:\n   - sqlite-vec uses internal C++ std::mutex structures\n   - These fail when multiple processes load the extension\n   - The mutex error occurs at the native code level, not the SQLite database level\n   - File-based locking doesn't help because the C++ mutexes are process-local\n\n3. **Solution**: \n   - Migrated to Orama (pure JavaScript vector database)\n   - Removed sqlite-vec and better-sqlite3 dependencies\n   - Removed the database.ts utility that handled mutex locking\n   - Created new Orama-based vector stores\n\n4. **Key Technical Discoveries**:\n   - Orama has a default similarity threshold of ~0.8 which was filtering out legitimate search results\n   - The fix was to set `similarity: 0` to disable Orama's built-in threshold and handle filtering ourselves\n   - Long content combined with Orama's default threshold was causing vector search failures\n   - Persist/restore functionality works correctly in Orama\n\n5. **Architecture Changes**:\n   - Removed the http-server/daemon-client architecture that was supposed to be in place\n   - Now hooks directly instantiate search engines using Orama (pure JS, no mutex issues)\n   - No more process isolation issues since Orama is pure JavaScript\n\nLet me extract these as memories:\n\n1. **sqlite-vec mutex issue and solution**\n   Encountered critical threading problems with sqlite-vec's C++ mutex implementation, requiring a complete migration to a pure JavaScript vector database to resolve process-level locking conflicts.\n\n2. **SQLite threading mode configuration**\n   Native SQLite extensions can create complex threading challenges, especially when running in multi-threaded mode. Proper configuration and understanding of thread safety modes are crucial for preventing mutex-related errors.\n\n3. **Orama similarity threshold behavior**\n   Vector search performance depends critically on similarity threshold settings. Orama's default 0.8 threshold was aggressively filtering results, necessitating manual threshold adjustment to 0 for comprehensive search coverage.\n\n4. **Migration steps and dependencies removed**\n   Streamlined the architecture by eliminating complex dependencies like sqlite-vec and better-sqlite3, replacing them with a lightweight, pure JavaScript vector database solution that simplifies process interactions.\n\n5. **Why native C++ extensions cause process isolation issues**\n   C++ extensions introduce low-level threading complexities that can break cross-process communication, making pure JavaScript solutions more reliable for maintaining consistent state and avoiding mutex-related failures.\n\n## Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"memories\": [\n    {\n      \"subject\": \"sqlite-vec causes mutex errors in multi-process hook execution\",\n      \"keywords\": [\n        \"sqlite-vec\",\n        \"mutex\",\n        \"process isolation\",\n        \"hooks\",\n        \"threading\",\n        \"C++ extension\"\n      ],\n      \"applies_to\": \"global\",\n      \"content\": \"## Problem\\nsqlite-vec was causing 'mutex lock failed: Invalid argument' errors when hooks tried to access the database.

Making the MCP server run as a stdio process (it already does)\n2. Multiple local-recall instances running and potentially cross-communicating\n3. The issue with shared Orama indexes when multiple processes write to them\n4. A proposal for a new architecture where:\n   - Embeddings are stored as sidecar files next to memories\n   - A \"no-embeddings\" mode for cloud agents that can't call Ollama\n   - Memories created without embeddings can be embedded later by local processes\n   - Standard mode tries to load from disk embeddings first, falls back to Ollama\n\nKey insights from this session:\n1. The current architecture has a concurrency problem when multiple instances try to update the Orama indexes\n2. The solution being discussed is to store embeddings as separate files so they can be version controlled\n3. There's a need for a \"no-embeddings\" mode for cloud agents\n4. The vector store needs to be able to load from disk embeddings and fall back to Ollama generation\n\nLet me extract the important memories:\n\n1. **Orama Index Concurrency Problem** - Multiple processes writing to the same index JSON file causes lost updates. This applies to both episodic and thinking indexes.\n\n2. **Cloud Agent Memory Creation** - Cloud agents need to be able to create memories without access to Ollama/embeddings. They should be able to create memory files that local processes can later embed.\n\n3. **Embedding Storage Strategy** - The proposal is to store embeddings as sidecar `.embedding.json` files next to memory files so they can be version controlled and shared.\n\n4. **Two-Mode System** - Need a \"no-embeddings\" mode for cloud agents that loads from disk embeddings only, and a standard mode that tries disk embeddings first, then falls back to Ollama.\n \nI'll focus on project isolation to prevent cross-contamination between different development environments. Each project will maintain its own dedicated local-recall directory, ensuring that memories and indexes remain strictly separated. This approach prevents unintended interactions between different coding sessions or project contexts, maintaining clean and isolated memory management for each unique development workspace. I'll generate embeddings locally when possible, falling back to Ollama for vector creation if needed. The process ensures cloud agents can create memory files, while local processes handle embedding generation efficiently. This approach allows seamless memory contribution across different computing environments, with embedding vectors stored conveniently next to their corresponding memory files.\n\nThe embedding file format includes metadata like model type, dimensions, creation timestamp, and the actual vector data. By tracking these files alongside memory markdown files, we enable version control, easy index rebuilding, and minimize potential write conflicts during memory management.\n\nThe loading strategy prioritizes disk-based embeddings, with configurable modes to handle scenarios where embedding generation might be unnecessary or computationally expensive. This flexible approach supports distributed memory creation while maintaining a consistent, efficient vector storage mechanism.\n\nProject isolation ensures that each codebase maintains its own local recall directory, preventing cross-contamination between different instances. By segregating memory files and Orama indexes, the system guarantees that concurrent processes within the same project can safely interact without risking data interference or unintended overwrites.\n\nThe proposed architecture supports two distinct operational modes: a standard local mode with full embedding capabilities and a cloud-optimized mode designed for environments with limited embedding generation resources. This flexible approach allows seamless adaptation across different deployment scenarios.\n\n## Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"memories\": [\n    {\n      \"subject\": \"Orama index concurrency issue with multiple processes writing simultaneously\",\n      \"keywords\": [\"orama\", \"concurrency\", \"index-corruption\", \"multi-process\", \"lost-updates\", \"race-condition\", \"json-index\"],\n      \"applies_to\": \"global\",\n      \"content\": \"## Problem\\n\\nWhen multiple local-recall instances (different Claude Code sessions) work on the same project, they all write to the same Orama index files (`orama-episodic-index.json`, `orama-thinking-index.json`) without coordination.\\n\\n## Root Cause\\n\\nEach Claude Code instance spawns its own MCP server process.

Let me analyze what was learned and discovered:\n\n1. **Mutex Lock Error Root Cause** - The error \"mutex lock failed: Invalid argument\" happens when a thread tries to lock a mutex that's already been destroyed. This is related to sqlite-vec's C++ internal mutexes on macOS 10.13.\n\n2. **Architecture Issue Found** - The hooks and daemon were completely independent with no communication mechanism between them. This was a design issue that needed fixing.\n\n3. **Solution Implemented** - They implemented an HTTP server in the daemon that hooks can communicate with via HTTP clients. This removes the need for hooks to directly access sqlite-vec.\n\n4. **Mutex Problem Solved** - By having hooks communicate with the daemon instead of direct database access, the \"mutex lock failed\" error is avoided because the daemon has single-threaded access to the database while hooks make HTTP requests.\n\n5. **HTTP Port Configuration** - The HTTP server uses a random port in the 7xxx range (7847 was chosen).\n\n6. **Files Changed/Created**:\n   - Created: `src/mcp-server/http-server.ts` - HTTP server for daemon\n   - Created: `src/utils/daemon-client.ts` - HTTP client for hooks\n   - Modified: `src/hooks/user-prompt-submit.ts` - Now uses daemon client\n   - Modified: `src/hooks/session-start.ts` - Now uses daemon client\n   - Modified: `src/mcp-server/server.ts` - Starts HTTP server\n   - Modified: `CLAUDE.md` - Documentation updated\n   - Modified: `src/core/types.ts` - HTTP port configuration\n\n7. **Architecture Change** - Moved from direct database access in hooks to a client-server model where:\n   - Daemon runs HTTP server and owns sqlite-vec database\n   - Hooks make HTTP requests to daemon\n   - This eliminates mutex contention issues\n\n8. \n\nI verified the test suite's comprehensive validation, confirming the architectural changes resolved previous synchronization challenges.

It checks: `episodicNeedsMigration: episodicMdFiles.length > 0 && !episodicHasJsonl`\n\nThis means: \"only migrate if there are .md files AND no JSONL files exist yet\"\n\nBut once you have JSONL files (from a partial migration), remaining .md files are orphaned.

But the MCP server process running from `./dist/` was started on Saturday and hasn't been restarted.So the issue is:1. The MCP server daemon (PID 52456) is running old code from Saturday2. Even though I rebuilt, the running process still has the old code loaded3. The daemon is extracting transcripts and creating new memories with old code\n\nThe solution is to restart the MCP server. But first, let me verify if there's actually an older version of the code that creates .md files, or if this is an entirely different issue.\n\nActually wait - I've been looking at the latest code, but the version 0.1.10 that's running might have the old memory creation code. Let me search more carefully for where .md files might be created, maybe there's an old path I'm not seeing.\n\nLet me search for where `uuid` is used to create filenames:\n\n## Output\n\nThe running MCP server process (PID 52456) was started Saturday and hasn't picked up the new code. But let me verify there's no old code path that creates .md files:","timestamp":"2025-12-21T20:02:52.407Z"}

This confirms that the old code created markdown files.Now I understand the issue:1. The MCP server process (PID 52456) was started on Saturday2. That process is running the old code that creates `.md` files3. Even though I rebuilt the source code, the old process is still running with old code loaded in memory\n\nThe fix is to restart the MCP server. But first, let me also check what the status of these 4 new .md files is - they were created after my migration ran. Let me delete them and run migration again to clean them up. Or I could restart the MCP server first to prevent more from being created.Actually, looking at the git status from earlier, there were 4 untracked .md files:\n```\n?? local-recall/episodic-memory/10f3e1e1-2182-4afd-94b6-374a5a9704e6.md\n?? local-recall/episodic-memory/852fd16f-8310-4517-b687-08418b8a7f69.md\n?? local-recall/episodic-memory/a225ca61-b6fd-4272-b543-d62cbe5fb42d.md\n?? local-recall/episodic-memory/a4dbff23-ee4d-4ae9-8fd6-0524193c85d5.md\n```\nBut after migration, there are now 4 different .md files:```-rw-r--r--@  1 joe  staff     1114 21 Dec 19:51 27b80781-6247-4e04-b27a-868de3cb890b.md\n-rw-r--r--@  1 joe  staff      943 21 Dec 19:51 3040249e-938e-483c-829c-ba585eb95693.md-rw-r--r--@  1 joe  staff     1356 21 Dec 19:51 7c397f1e-549e-4d9d-af59-3e0d36bf193c.md\n\n\n-rw-r--r--@  1 joe  staff      967 21 Dec 19:51 b2ca2ec2-5e40-4eb7-8b7e-1a6156dc799c.md\n```\n\nI see the migration process deleted the original .md files, but the running MCP daemon immediately generated new markdown files. This persistent behavior indicates the old server process is still active and generating files using the outdated method. I'll need a systematic approach to resolve this file generation issue and transition to the new JSONL storage format.\n\n## Output\n\nFound the issue! The old `memory.ts` (before JSONL migration) created `.md` files directly:\n\n```javascript\nprivate getFilePath(id: string): string {\n  return path.join(this.memoriesDir, `${id}.md`);\n}\n```\n\nThe MCP server daemon (PID 52456) was started on Saturday and is still running old code. Those 4 new `.md` files were created by the daemon's transcript extraction after migration ran.\n\n`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n**Process lifecycle and hot reloading**: Node.js loads code once at startup. Rebuilding TypeScript only updates files on disk - running processes keep the old code in memory. This is why long-running daemons need explicit restart mechanisms after deployments.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\nTo fix this completely:\n1. The MCP server process needs to be restarted\n2. Run migration again to clean up the 4 new `.md` files","timestamp":"2025-12-21T20:02:52.564Z"}

Stale MCP Server Process\nThe MCP server daemon (started Saturday) was running old code that created `.md` files. Killed the old process - now new memories will use JSONL format.\n\n### Changes Made\n- `src/core/migration.ts`: Fixed migration to always run when `.md` files exist\n- `src/hooks/user-prompt-submit.ts`: Removed `.md` extension from log output  \n- `src/mcp-server/tools.ts`: Updated description from \"markdown files\" to \"JSONL files\"\n\n### Migration Results\n- Episodic: 218 memories migrated total (197 + 21)\n- Thinking: 214 memories migrated\n- All `.md` files deleted, now using only JSONL format","timestamp":"2025-12-21T20:02:53.236Z"}

Looking at the `load()` method in `jsonl-store.ts`, it correctly identifies the last file and sets `currentFileNumber` and `currentFileEntryCount`:\n\n```typescript\n// Determine current file number and entry count\nif (files.length > 0) {\n  const lastFile = files[files.length - 1]!;\n  const match = lastFile.match(/-(\\d{6})\\.jsonl$/);\n  this.currentFileNumber = match ? parseInt(match[1]!, 10) : 1;\n  this.currentFileEntryCount = await this.countEntriesInFile(lastFile);\n} else {\n  this.currentFileNumber = 1;\n  this.currentFileEntryCount = 0;\n}\n```\n\nBut the problem is in `clearCache()`:\n\n```typescript\nclearCache(): void {\n  this.memories = null;\n  this.embeddings = null;\n  this.stats = null;\n  this.currentFileNumber = 1;          // <-- BUG! Resets to 1\n  this.currentFileEntryCount = 0;\n}\n```\n\nWhen `clearCache()` is called (which happens after compaction, or potentially from external code), it resets `currentFileNumber` back to 1. This means if you have files `episodic-000001.jsonl` through `episodic-000006.jsonl`, after a cache clear, new entries will be appended to file 1 instead of file 6!\n\nThe issue is that `appendEntry()` calls `load()` at the start:\n```typescript\nasync appendEntry(entry: TEntry): Promise<void> {\n  await this.load(); // Ensure state is loaded\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nAnd `load()` has an early return if memories is not null:\n```typescript\nasync load(): Promise<void> {\n  if (this.memories !== null) {\n    return; // Already loaded\n  }\n  // Tracing the logic reveals that when memories is null, it will re-scan files\n  // This means the current file number should be correctly reset based on existing files\n}\n```\n\nI realize now that when `clearCache()` is called, the subsequent `load()` will actually re-scan and correctly set the `currentFileNumber` based on existing files. The mechanism for file tracking is more robust than initially suspected.\n\nThe key insight is that `load()` will dynamically determine the correct file state each time it runs, preventing stale tracking of file numbers. This self-correcting behavior ensures that even after cache clearing, the file tracking remains accurate.\n\nHowever, a critical scenario emerges when files are externally added without cache invalidation. The current implementation might fail to detect new files if `memories` is already populated, leading to potential misallocation of new entries to outdated file references.\n\nThe problem likely stems from two interconnected issues: premature caching and incomplete file state detection. When multiple processes or instances interact with the file system, the current tracking mechanism becomes unreliable, potentially causing entries to be written to incorrect files.\n\nThe root cause appears to be the assumption that the initial file state remains constant, which breaks down in dynamic file system environments where external file additions can occur unexpectedly. I'll investigate potential synchronization and initialization issues with the file-based memory store. The initial values suggest a race condition where multiple store instances could reset file tracking. The `load()` method seems intended to update file tracking, but the `this.memories !== null` check might not fully prevent concurrent initialization problems. \n\nI need to trace how store instances are created and whether singleton patterns or dependency injection could introduce unexpected state resets. The first-time initialization logic looks fragile, especially if multiple components might trigger `load()` simultaneously or create new store instances.\n\nThe key concern is ensuring consistent file numbering and entry tracking across potential concurrent or repeated store instantiations. The current implementation leaves room for potential state inconsistencies during initial load and file tracking. I trace a potential synchronization problem where memory initialization could bypass proper file scanning. The early `memories` map assignment combined with directory creation timing creates a race condition. If file system operations occur asynchronously, the initial load might set default values prematurely, preventing subsequent proper file discovery and tracking. This could lead to incorrect file numbering and potential data inconsistency when entries are appended across different system states.\n\nThe key vulnerability emerges from the early initialization of `memories` and `currentFileNumber`, which locks in default values before comprehensive file system verification occurs. Race conditions between directory creation, file listing, and memory initialization could silently disrupt expected tracking behavior. Instance B encounters a synchronization challenge where its local entry count becomes outdated. When it loads and counts entries in file 6, it captures 100 entries, but the file has since grown to 150 entries due to Instance A's modifications. This stale count means Instance B might incorrectly believe file 6 has room for more entries when it's actually closer to capacity. The concurrent file access creates a potential race condition where file state can change between instances without immediate visibility.\n\nI'll investigate the test suite to understand the expected behavior and verify if this scenario is already covered by existing test cases. Examining how different processes interact with the store could reveal underlying synchronization or concurrency design issues.\n\n## Output\n\nI found the issue. Looking at `jsonl-store.ts`, there's a bug in the `clearCache()` method at line 521-527:\n\n```typescript\nclearCache(): void {\n  this.memories = null;\n  this.embeddings = null;\n  this.stats = null;\n  this.currentFileNumber = 1;       // BUG: Resets to 1!\n  this.currentFileEntryCount = 0;\n}\n```\n\nWhen `clearCache()` is called, it resets `currentFileNumber` to 1. The next call to `appendEntry()` does call `load()`, which should re-discover the correct file number. But let me check if there's a scenario where this doesn't work correctly.\n\nLet me also look at the test file to understand the expected behavior:","timestamp":"2025-12-22T09:10:01.655Z"}

Let me search for a test that handles multi-file cases...\n\nActually, looking at the tests, they're all testing with file `episodic-000001.jsonl`. There's no explicit test for:\n1. Creating a new store instance when multiple files already exist\n2. Checking that appends go to the last file, not file 1\n\nLet me check if there's a test in the base jsonl-store.test.ts or if the multi-file logic has tests.\n\nAlso, I need to understand the actual bug better. Let me trace through the flow more carefully.\n\nThe user says they see additions to `-000001.jsonl` when there are multiple files. This could happen if:\n\n1. The store doesn't correctly identify the last file \n2. After clearCache(), the reload doesn't happen properly\n3. There's a race condition or multiple instances issue\n\nLet me check the jsonl-store.ts again more carefully, particularly:\n1. How `getExistingFiles` determines the files\n2. The `load()` flow for determining `currentFileNumber`\n3. The `appendEntry()` flow\n\nOh wait, I think I see it! Looking at the `load()` method:\n\n```typescript\nasync load(): Promise<void> {\n  if (this.memories !== null) {\n    return; // Already loaded\n  }\n\n  this.memories = new Map();\n  // ... \n  \n  const files = await this.getExistingFiles();\n  \n  // ... process files ...\n  \n  // Determine current file number and entry count\n  if (files.length > 0) {\n    const lastFile = files[files.length - 1]!;\n    const match = lastFile.match(/-(\\d{6})\\.jsonl$/);\n    this.currentFileNumber = match ? parseInt(match[1]!, 10) : 1;\n\n\n```\n\nThe problem is in the file number determination logic. When multiple files exist, it's not correctly identifying the last file's number. The current implementation might default to 1 if the matching fails, which could cause incorrect file numbering.\n\nThe code assumes the last file in the array is the correct one to base the current file number on, but this might not always be true, especially if files are not perfectly sequential or have been deleted.\n\nI'll need to modify the logic to more robustly determine the highest file number, perhaps by sorting the files numerically before selecting the last one.\n\n```\n\ntypescript\nI'm tracking a potential synchronization issue with file numbering. The problem might stem from concurrent file creation or a race condition during append operations. \n\nThe `clearCache()` method resets key tracking variables, but something seems off with how `load()` determines the current file number. I suspect there could be an edge case where file selection isn't deterministic when `memories` is null.\n\nThe timing around file creation and entry counting looks particularly tricky. I need to investigate how file number selection happens when multiple processes might be interacting with the same file storage system.\n``` I see a potential synchronization issue where different processes might create and modify file stores concurrently. The core problem involves file tracking across processes, where an initial store instance might not detect new files created elsewhere. \n\nThe critical insight is that caching can lead to stale state when multiple processes interact with the same storage system. Specifically, a process might continue using an outdated file reference without recognizing new files generated by another process.\n\nThe investigation reveals complex interactions between file creation, caching, and process-level file tracking that could cause unexpected appending behavior. I see a potential synchronization issue with file handling. The `clearCache()` method resets the file number to 1, and the `load()` method has an early return mechanism that could create a race-like scenario. Even though JavaScript is single-threaded, async operations create potential gaps where state could be inconsistently managed. The key problem appears to be how `currentFileNumber` is set and how `load()` handles initialization, potentially leaving the file number stuck at 1 when multiple files exist.\n\nThe async method introduces a subtle timing vulnerability where concurrent calls might not properly initialize or track file state, risking data integrity and correct file numbering during rapid operations.\n\nThe core issue stems from prematurely marking initialization as complete before critical asynchronous file discovery finishes. This allows subsequent method calls to proceed with potentially stale or incorrect file context, leading to incorrect file appending and state management.\n\nThree potential resolution strategies emerge: delaying global state marking, implementing synchronization primitives, or strategically reordering initialization sequence to ensure consistent file tracking before permitting further interactions.\n\nThe proposed solutions aim to create a robust, race-condition-resistant initialization mechanism that guarantees accurate file state before enabling subsequent method executions.\n\n## Output\n\nNow I understand the issue. Looking at `jsonl-store.ts`, there's a **race condition** in the `load()` method. Let me trace through it:\n\n`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n**The Bug: Race Condition in `load()`**\n\n1. `load()` sets `this.memories = new Map()` **synchronously** at the start (line 163)\n2. Then it does async file discovery with `await this.getExistingFiles()` (line 177)\n3. `currentFileNumber` is only set **after** the async work (lines 212-220)\n\nIf two calls to `appendEntry()` happen concurrently:\n- Call 1 enters `load()`, sets `memories = new Map()`, then yields at `await`\n- Call 2 enters `load()`, sees `memories !== null`, returns early\n- Call 2 proceeds with `currentFileNumber = 1` (the default!)\n- Appends to file 1 instead of the correct file\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\nLet me verify this is indeed the issue and write a fix:","timestamp":"2025-12-22T09:10:02.536Z"}
