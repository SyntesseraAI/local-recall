## Thought

The user wants to work on improving the logic for what content is considered "memory worthy". Let me look at the current implementation in the `analyzeForMemories` function in `src/utils/transcript.ts` to understand the current approach.

From what I read earlier, the current approach uses simple regex patterns to look for keywords like:
- decision, chose, approach, strategy, pattern
- fixed, solved, solution, resolved
- configured, setting, config, environment
- convention, pattern, always, never, standard, rule
- important, note, remember, don't forget

This is a fairly naive approach. The user probably wants something more sophisticated or different.

Let me ask them what direction they want to take this, or explore what they have in mind.

## Output

The current approach in `src/utils/transcript.ts:105-191` uses simple regex patterns to detect "memory-worthy" content:

```typescript
const patterns = {
  decision: /(?:decided|decision|chose|approach|strategy|pattern)[\s:]+(.+)/gi,
  solution: /(?:fixed|solved|solution|resolved|fix was|issue was)[\s:]+(.+)/gi,
  configuration: /(?:configured?|setting|config|environment|\.env)[\s:]+(.+)/gi,
  convention: /(?:convention|pattern|always|never|standard|rule)[\s:]+(.+)/gi,
  important: /(?:important|note|remember|don'?t forget)[\s:]+(.+)/gi,
};
```

This is quite naive - it'll miss a lot of valuable context and may capture noise.

What direction do you want to take this? Some options:

1. **Explicit markers** - Only save memories when Claude explicitly marks something with a tag like `[REMEMBER]` or uses the MCP tool directly
2. **Smarter heuristics** - Improve patterns to capture architectural decisions, bug explanations, user preferences, project conventions
3. **LLM-based analysis** - Use Claude (via API) to analyze the transcript and extract meaningful memories
4. **User-triggered** - Only create memories when the user asks ("remember this", "save this for later")
5. **Hybrid** - Combine explicit markers with some automatic detection

What fits your vision for the tool?
