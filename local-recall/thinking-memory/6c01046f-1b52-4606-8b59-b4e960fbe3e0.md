## Thought

The user is asking me to update the documentation. This is a bit vague - I should ask them what specifically they'd like me to update. Let me first understand what documentation exists and what the current state of the codebase is.

Looking at the git status, I can see there are modified files:
- src/core/index.ts
- src/core/memory.ts
- src/core/types.ts
- src/hooks/stop.ts
- src/index.ts
- src/mcp-server/tools.ts
- src/utils/markdown.ts
- src/utils/transcript.ts

And there's a CLAUDE.md file that serves as the main documentation.

The user's request is vague. I should ask them what specifically they'd like me to update in the documentation, or what changes have been made that need to be reflected.

## Output

I'd be happy to help update the documentation, but I need a bit more context. Could you clarify what you'd like me to update?

For example:
- Should I update the documentation to reflect the changes in the modified files (`src/core/index.ts`, `src/core/memory.ts`, `src/mcp-server/tools.ts`, etc.)?
- Is there a specific section of the documentation that's out of date?
- Are there new features or changes that need to be documented?

Let me know what changes need to be captured and I'll update the docs accordingly.
