## Thought

We have some test failures. Let me look at the specific failures to understand what's happening. The issues seem to be in the integration tests related to the vector store. The problem is likely that with ephemeral connections, each operation creates a new connection, but the integration tests may be expecting state to persist across operations differently.

Let me check what's happening:

1. "should make new memories searchable via vector search" - expecting a specific ID but getting a different one
2. "should handle delete and recreate pattern" - expected false to be true
3. "should remove deleted memories from search" - expected false to be true
4. "should organize and retrieve memories by scope" - expected length 1 but got 5
5. "should persist data across manager instances" - expected false to be true
6. "should recover from missing vector store by rebuilding" - expected false to be true
7. "should handle many keywords" - expected false to be true

The issue is that the tests may be relying on the vector store singleton to share state, or there may be issues with how the tests are structured. Let me read the integration test to understand better.

## Output

Some integration tests are failing. Let me examine the test file to understand what's happening:
