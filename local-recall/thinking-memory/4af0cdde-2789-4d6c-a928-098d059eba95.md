## Thought

There are several references in the memory files themselves. These are historical records of past thinking, so I probably shouldn't change the content of the thinking memory files since they're historical records. But I should update:
1. The docs/hooks.md reference to the documentation file
2. The episodic memory files that may still be relevant

- docs/hooks.md - reference to the documentation file
- The episodic memory files at least should be reviewed

Let me update the docs/hooks.md reference and then rename the thinking-memories.md doc file.

## Output

Let me update the remaining documentation references. The memory files are historical records so I'll leave them, but I should update the docs and episodic memories:
