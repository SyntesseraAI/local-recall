## Thought

Done. The default logging level is now 'error'. Users can still override it with the `LOCAL_RECALL_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable if they need more verbose logging.

## Output

Done. Default logging is now `error`. Users can override with `LOCAL_RECALL_LOG_LEVEL=debug` (or `info`, `warn`) if needed.
