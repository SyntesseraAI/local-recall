## Thought

I found it! In the condensed transcript, I can see:

```
[Assistant] `★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**The Problem:** When a slash command runs, file references like `skills/create-schedule.md` are resolved relative to the **user's project directory**, not the plugin directory. So the command is looking for the skill file in `test-app/skills/`, which doesn't exist.

**Plugin Commands Must Be Self-Contained:** Unlike local project commands that can reference other files, plugin commands need to include all their content inline because the plug...
```

So "insights" appear to be formatted text that's shown to the user in explanatory mode. They're part of the assistant's text output, not a separate content block type. The format appears to be:

```
`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**The Problem:** ...
**Plugin Commands Must Be Self-Contained:** ...
```

This is just styled text within a `text` content block, not a separate block type. So to capture these "insights," we'd need to:
1. Parse the text content of assistant messages
2. Look for patterns like "`★ Insight" or similar formatted sections
3. Extract that text as part of thinking memory

Let me look at the actual JSONL to see what this looks like in the raw content blocks.

Let me find the actual raw JSONL structure:
