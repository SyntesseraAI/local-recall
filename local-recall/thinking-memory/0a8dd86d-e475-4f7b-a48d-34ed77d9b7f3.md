Now I understand the issue. The mutex error is happening in the sqlite-vec or better-sqlite3 layer. This could be caused by:

1. **Concurrent access**: Both the regular `user-prompt-submit.ts` hook and the `user-prompt-submit-thinking.ts` hook might be running simultaneously and both trying to access the same `memory.sqlite` file.

2. **Singleton conflict**: The thinking vector store and regular vector store both use `memory.sqlite` (same file), and they each maintain their own singleton instances. If both hooks run at the same time, they could both try to open/lock the same database file.

Looking at the code:
- `thinking-vector-store.ts:18`: `const DB_FILENAME = 'memory.sqlite';`
- Both vector stores share the same database file but have separate singleton instances

This is a classic database locking issue. When two processes try to open the same SQLite file with `better-sqlite3`, and especially when using the `sqlite-vec` extension, you can get mutex/locking errors.

The key issue is that hooks run as separate processes - each hook invocation spawns a new Node.js process. So you have:
1. `user-prompt-submit.js` - opens memory.sqlite
2. `user-prompt-submit-thinking.js` - tries to open the same memory.sqlite

SQLite with WAL mode should handle this, but the sqlite-vec extension might have issues with concurrent access, especially during initialization.

Solutions:
1. **Combine the hooks** - Have one hook do both episodic and thinking searches
2. **Use separate database files** for thinking memories
3. **Add retry logic with delay** when opening the database
4. **Use a lock file** to serialize access
5. **Configure SQLite busy timeout** properly

Let me check if the hooks are configured to run in parallel and if there's any busy timeout configuration.
