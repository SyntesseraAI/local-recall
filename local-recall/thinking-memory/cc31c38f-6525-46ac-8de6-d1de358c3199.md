## Thought

Now I have a good picture of what's in the memory system. Let me summarize this for the user.

## Output

I currently have **2 memories** stored in this project's Local Recall system:

## Memory 1: Memory Storage Format
Documents how the memory system stores conversation content:
- Full messages are stored (not summarized)
- Messages get prefixed with `**user**:` or `**assistant**:`
- Both user-triggered and auto-detected patterns are supported

## Memory 2: User-Triggered Patterns
Documents the trigger phrases I recognize:
- "remember this", "save this for later", "don't forget", "note this down", etc.
- Also documents auto-detection heuristics for architecture decisions, bug fixes, explanations, discoveries, and conventions

### How the System Works

The Local Recall system gives me persistent memory through:

1. **Hooks** - On session start, I receive relevant memories. On session end, new memories are extracted from the transcript.

2. **MCP Tools** - I can create, search, list, and manage memories directly:
   - `memory_create` / `memory_search` / `memory_list` / `memory_get`
   - `index_rebuild`

3. **Markdown Files** - Each memory is a `.md` file with YAML frontmatter containing metadata (id, subject, keywords, scope)

You can ask me to "remember" things, or I'll automatically detect valuable information like architectural decisions, bug fixes, or project conventions and store them for future sessions.
