## Thought

Interesting! I see that:

1. The test suite is working - "Say hello world" searched and got: - 50 episodic results but none above 50% similarity   - 17 thinking results, 2 above threshold2. For session 6029d1dc (internal test prompt) - it correctly skipped
The 50% threshold is being used now (the log says "No episodic memories above 50% similarity").But my actual prompt "ok, let's test orama" isn't showing in the logs. Either:
1. The hook didn't fire for my prompt2. My prompt was before the logs I checked3. My session uses a different mechanism

Actually, I realize I'm in the same session as when I was looking at the logs - so the hook for my prompt should show. But the timestamps show 11:58:30 which is from the test run I just did (`npm test`), not from my actual prompt.My session is e28baaea-eb58-47e7-839c-d1e50afba24f which had the "Skipping internal prompt" at 11:52:54. Let me check if there were any prompts after that for this session.Actually, maybe the issue is that my current session is using some form of tool execution that doesn't trigger the UserPromptSubmit hook - like if I'm in a special mode where Claude Code doesn't fire hooks.

Let me just verify that Orama is working correctly by doing a manual test of the search functionality.

## Output

The tests show Orama is working - the log shows "No episodic memories above 50% similarity" (the new threshold). Let me do a quick manual test of the search:
