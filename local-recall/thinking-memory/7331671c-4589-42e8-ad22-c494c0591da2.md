## Thought

Now I see the key difference! In the "good" JSON, the first vector has length 2, which matches what I saw in the "bad" JSON. This nested structure `[docId, [magnitude, [actual_vector]]]` is how Orama stores vectors internally.

Both have `size: 384` and both have vectors as arrays with length 2 (which is the nested structure). So the structure is actually the same!

The issue must be something else. Let me check if maybe the problem is with how we persisted originally - perhaps from a corrupted or incomplete database. Let me delete the index files and do a complete fresh sync with the current code.

## Output

The structure looks the same. Let me delete the index and do a fresh sync with verbose logging:
