## Thought

The user has provided clear answers:

1. **Storage mode**: Keep Orama index - JSONL for memory storage, Orama index file for faster startup
2. **Embed format**: Separate embeddings entry - embeddings as separate entries with type='embeddings' and memory id reference
3. **Compaction**: Yes, auto-compact when file grows too large or has too many deletions
4. **Migration**: Delete old folders after successful migration

Now I understand the full requirements. Let me launch a Plan agent to design the implementation, then write the final plan.

## Output

Now I'll launch a Plan agent to design the implementation based on these requirements.
