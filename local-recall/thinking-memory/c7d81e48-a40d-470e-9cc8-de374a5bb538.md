## Thought

I see the problem now:

The local `local-recall-plugin/` directory has:
- `scripts/` with `mcp-server/server.js` and `hooks/` 

But the cached plugin at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/syntesseraai-local-recall/local-recall/0.1.3/` only has:
- `.mcp.json`
- `config/`
- `skills/`

The `scripts/` directory is missing!

This means the plugin was published or cached without including the scripts directory. The plugin's `dist_glob` pattern (used when fetching from the marketplace) probably didn't include the scripts directory.

Let me find the actual plugin registry to see how this is configured:
