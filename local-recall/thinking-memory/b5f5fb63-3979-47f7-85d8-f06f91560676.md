Now I have all the information I need:

1. **UserPromptSubmit hook input**: JSON with `session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`, `permission_mode`, `hook_event_name`, and `prompt`

2. Extract the `prompt` field
3. Extract keywords from the prompt
4. Search memories using those keywords
5. Output any matching memories to stdout (they get added to context)

Let me also check the existing search functionality and utils to understand how to best extract keywords.
