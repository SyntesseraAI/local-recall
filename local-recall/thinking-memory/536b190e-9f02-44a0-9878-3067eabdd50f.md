All 3 tests pass now:
1. "should spawn claude -p with a simple prompt..." - 3477ms ✓
2. "should spawn quickly (under 1 second to start)" - 2ms ✓
3. "should handle keyword extraction prompt format" - 2769ms ✓The fix works. The issue was that `stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe']` causes the Claude CLI to hang waiting for stdin to be closed, but using `stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe']` fixes this.Let me also run the full test suite to make sure I didn't break anything.
