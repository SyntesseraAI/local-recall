Now I have a clearer picture. Let me summarize the evidence of thinking in transcripts:

1. **thinkingMetadata** field on user entries - shows `level: "high"`, `disabled: false`, `triggers: []`
2. **Model name** - `claude-opus-4-5-20251101` (Opus 4.5 which has extended thinking)
3. **Thinking content blocks** - `type: "thinking"` with `thinking` string and `signature`

Let me also compare with a file that doesn't have thinking blocks to see the difference.
