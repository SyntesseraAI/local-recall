## Thought

All tasks completed. Let me summarize what was done.

## Output

Done. Changes made:

**`src/core/vector-store.ts:258-268`**:
- Scores now rounded to 2 decimal places: `Math.round((1 - row.distance / 2) * 100) / 100`
- Added secondary sort by `occurred_at` for results with equal scores

**`CLAUDE.md`**:
- Added "Scoring and Ranking" section documenting the behavior

Build passes. The next search results you see should show cleaner scores (e.g., 65% instead of 65.2341%) and equivalent-scored memories will be ordered newest first.
