## Thought

The user is greeting me and asking what decision we're making today. This seems like a general greeting/question. Let me check if there's any context from the git branch name or recent activity that might indicate what we're working on.

Looking at the git status:
- Current branch: `claude/create-claude-md-01PPHDFfpxRruDbNfybJi4Y4`
- Status is clean (no uncommitted changes)

The branch name suggests this might have been about creating a CLAUDE.md file, which already exists based on the context provided.

I don't have specific context about what decision needs to be made today. I should just respond conversationally and ask what they'd like to work on.

## Output

Hello! I don't have any specific pending decisions from our conversation - this appears to be a fresh session.

Looking at the current state:
- **Branch**: `claude/create-claude-md-01PPHDFfpxRruDbNfybJi4Y4`
- **Status**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)
- **Project**: Local Recall - a markdown-powered memory system for AI coding assistants

The branch name suggests work on the CLAUDE.md file, which already exists and is quite comprehensive.

What would you like to work on today?
