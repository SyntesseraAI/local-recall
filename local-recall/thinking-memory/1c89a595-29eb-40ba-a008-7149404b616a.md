## Thought

The user wants me to:
1. Turn on all memory types by default
2. Bump the plugin version
3. Commit and push

Let me check what skills might be relevant. Looking at the available skills:
- This is a straightforward task - making config changes, bumping versions, and committing
- No complex planning or debugging needed
- This is essentially a multi-step task but fairly mechanical

Let me first understand what "all memory types" means in this codebase. From the CLAUDE.md, I can see there are:
- `episodicEnabled` - already defaults to `true`
- `thinkingEnabled` - need to check its current default

I should:
1. Check the current defaults in the types.ts file
2. Ensure both are set to true by default
3. Bump the version in package.json and plugin.json
4. Commit and push

Let me start by reading the relevant files.

## Output

I'll help you turn on all memory types by default, bump the plugin version, and commit/push. Let me start by checking the current state of the configuration and version files.
