## Thought

The user is asking about the hooks in this local-recall project. I should look at the hooks configuration and the source files to provide a comprehensive overview. Let me read the relevant files to understand the hooks better.

Based on the CLAUDE.md, there are three hooks:
1. SessionStart - loads memory index on session start
2. UserPromptSubmit - searches memories based on user prompt
3. Stop - parses transcript and creates memories

Let me read the hooks configuration and source files to give more details.

## Output

Let me look at the hooks implementation to give you a detailed overview.
