## Thought

I see the issue now. Looking at `http-server.ts`:

1. The `handleEpisodicSearch` function creates a new `SearchEngine` if one doesn't exist
2. The `handleThinkingSearch` function creates a new `ThinkingSearchEngine` if one doesn't exist

Both of these search engines use sqlite-vec and have their own vector stores. The problem might be:

1. When episodic search and thinking search are both called, they could be running concurrently and both trying to access the database at the same time
2. Both `SearchEngine` and `ThinkingSearchEngine` may be initializing their vector stores at similar times

Let me look at both search engines to understand how they handle the database access.

## Output

I see the issue. The HTTP server creates separate `SearchEngine` and `ThinkingSearchEngine` instances that each manage their own vector stores. Let me check if they share the same database connection or create separate ones.
