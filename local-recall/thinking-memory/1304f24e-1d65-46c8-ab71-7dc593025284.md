## Thought

The user wants me to update the docs folder files, not CLAUDE.md. They want CLAUDE.md to be clean and focused on what the repo needs, while the detailed documentation goes in the docs/ folder.

Based on my analysis of the changed files, I need to update these docs to reflect:

1. **No summarization or filtering** - All messages are saved as individual memories without filtering or summarization
2. **Deduplication** - Uses `occurred_at` and `content_hash` for idempotent memory creation
3. **Full content preservation** - Messages stored with role prefix (e.g., "**user**: ...")
4. **Updated memory format** - `occurred_at` and `content_hash` fields (not `updated_at`)
5. **Keyword extraction** - Uses `keyword-extractor` library, not RAKE/rake-pos
6. **MCP tools** - Only 5 tools (memory_create, memory_get, memory_search, memory_list, index_rebuild) - no memory_update or memory_delete

Let me update these documents:

1. **architecture.md** - Update the transcript analysis description, keyword extraction info
2. **hooks.md** - Update Stop Hook description to clarify no filtering/summarization
3. **mcp-server.md** - Update available tools (remove memory_update, memory_delete)
4. **memory-format.md** - Update fields (occurred_at, content_hash instead of updated_at)

I'll also update the todo list.

## Output

Now I understand. Let me update the docs folder files to reflect the changes, including the fact that memories are not summarized or filtered.
