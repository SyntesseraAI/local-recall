## Thought

I don't see specific code handling "explanatory mode" or "insights" in the codebase. The user is referring to a Claude Code feature that I need to understand better.

When Claude Code runs in "explanatory mode", it provides user-facing insights/explanations that are different from the internal thinking blocks. These insights are likely shown in the UI as they work through a problem.

I should ask the user for clarification about what the insight content blocks look like in the transcript format, since I don't have a sample transcript with insights to examine.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. Claude Code's explanatory mode shows "insights" to the user - these are concise explanations of what Claude is doing. These are different from the `thinking` blocks (which are internal reasoning) and `text` blocks (which are the response).

I should search Claude's documentation or check if there's a specific content block type for insights. Let me search for any related content in the transcripts directory or check what content block types actually exist.

## Output

I don't see "insight" as a content block type in the current codebase. To help implement this correctly, I need to understand the transcript format for explanatory mode. 

Could you share:
1. What does an insight look like in a transcript JSONL entry? Is it a separate content block type like `{ "type": "insight", "insight": "..." }` or is it structured differently?
2. Do you have a sample transcript with explanatory mode enabled that I could look at?

Alternatively, if you can describe the structure, I can add support for extracting insights alongside thinking and text blocks in the `thinking-extractor.ts`.
