## Thought

Looking at the code, I see the issue. In the `parseTranscriptForThinking` function (lines 74-112), it's looking for entries where `entry.type !== 'assistant'`. But based on the user's description of the problem, it seems like the thinking blocks and assistant messages might be on separate JSONL lines.

Let me understand the expected format better. The user said:
1. Work through the JSONL line by line
2. When you find a "thinking" line, hold it in a variable
3. Continue through the messages until you find the next assistant message
4. Add both to a memory

But the current implementation expects the thinking content to be inside the assistant message's content blocks. Let me check the transcript schema to understand the actual format.

## Output

Let me also look at the transcript schema to understand the JSONL format:
