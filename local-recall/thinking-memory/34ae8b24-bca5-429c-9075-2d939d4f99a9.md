## Thought

I see - the log shows:
1. SessionStart fired successfully
2. Stop hook fires but completes with "No recent messages to analyze"

The user was probably going to paste the log showing this behavior. The key issue is:

```
[2025-11-29T20:52:37.658Z] [INFO] [hooks] Stop hook completed: No recent messages to analyze
```

So the stop hook is firing but not finding any "recent messages" to create memories from. This is by design - it's looking for messages within a certain time window (the CLAUDE.md mentions "within last 30 seconds").

But the user says it "keeps firing" - so this might be:
1. Working as expected but the user expected it to create memories
2. Some confusion about what "recent messages" means
3. The time window being too narrow

Let me look at the stop hook implementation to understand the logic.

## Output

I see it - the stop hook fires but completes with "No recent messages to analyze". Let me look at the stop hook logic to understand the decision criteria:
