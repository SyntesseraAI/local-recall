The user wants me to look at a transcript file that has thinking blocks and look for other evidence of thinking - this could be things like:
1. The `thinkingMetadata` field in user message entries
2. Model names that support thinking (like claude-3-5-sonnet, opus, etc.)
3. Extended thinking configurations
4. Any other indicators

Let me read one of the files that has thinking blocks to investigate.
