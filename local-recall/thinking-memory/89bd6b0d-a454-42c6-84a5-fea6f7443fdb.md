## Thought

The build succeeded. Let me summarize the fix for the user.

## Output

Fixed. The changes were:

1. **Removed `timeout` option from `spawn`** - Node.js's built-in spawn timeout throws an `AbortError` when it kills the process, which wasn't being caught
2. **Added `safeResolve` wrapper** - Ensures the promise only resolves once, preventing race conditions between timeout and normal completion
3. **Removed duplicate `close` handler** - There were two `child.on('close', ...)` listeners, which could cause issues
4. **Added early-exit guard** - The `close` handler now checks if already resolved before processing

The AbortError was occurring because the spawn's `timeout: 30000` option was killing the child process after timeout, but the resulting abort wasn't being handled properly.
