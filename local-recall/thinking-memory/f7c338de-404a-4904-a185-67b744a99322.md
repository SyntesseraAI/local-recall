## Thought

Interesting - there's no `.claude/settings.json` file in the local-recall project. Let me check if there's a different location for the hooks configuration, like in a plugin structure. The memories mention `dev-marketplace/local-recall-plugin/config/hooks.json`. Let me also look at how users would configure hooks for their projects.

Let me investigate more:
1. Check if there's any hooks.json file
2. Look at the hook source files
3. Check how the plugin is distributed

## Output

Interesting - there's no `.claude/settings.json` file. Let me investigate further, looking at the hook source files and how users are supposed to configure hooks.
