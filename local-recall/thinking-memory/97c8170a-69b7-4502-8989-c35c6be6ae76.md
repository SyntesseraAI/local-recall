The user is asking if I can use a GitHub MCP server to see an inline suggestion from a PR. However, I don't have any GitHub MCP server configured in my available tools. Let me check what tools I have available.

Looking at my available tools, I have:
- Task
- Bash
- Glob
- Grep
- Read
- ExitPlanMode
- Edit
- Write
- NotebookEdit
- WebFetch
- TodoWrite
- WebSearch
- BashOutput
- KillShell
- Skill
- SlashCommand
- EnterPlanMode

I don't see any MCP tools available that start with "mcp__" which would indicate that an MCP server is configured and connected. The user would need to have a GitHub MCP server configured in their Claude Code settings for me to be able to access it.

I should let them know that I don't currently have access to a GitHub MCP server, and explain how they could set one up if they want that functionality.
