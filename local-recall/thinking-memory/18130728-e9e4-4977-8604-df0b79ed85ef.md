## Thought

The user is testing whether the mutex errors are gone. Based on the context from the memory system, there was previously a "mutex lock failed: Invalid argument" error that occurred when hooks directly loaded sqlite-vec. The fix was to use the HTTP daemon client instead.

Looking at the git status and the memories provided, it seems the project recently migrated from SQLite/sqlite-vec to Orama for vector search (commit 91d7734). This would eliminate the mutex issues since Orama is pure JavaScript.

The user is just doing a quick test to confirm things are working. I should keep my response brief.

## Output

The hook ran successfully - no mutex errors. With the Orama migration (pure JS), the sqlite-vec mutex contention issues are resolved.
