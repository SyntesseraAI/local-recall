Now I have a good understanding of how thinking extraction currently works. It:
1. Parses JSONL transcript lines
2. Looks for `type: 'assistant'` entries with `message.content` containing blocks
3. Extracts `type: 'thinking'` blocks and `type: 'text'` blocks

5. Creates thinking memories with format `## Thought\n\n{thinking}\n\n## Output\n\n{output}`

Now I need to understand what "insights" are in explanatory mode. I don't see any mention of "insights" in this code. Let me search for insights in the codebase and also check the types file to understand the full structure of content blocks.

## Output

Let me check the types and look for any existing insight handling:
