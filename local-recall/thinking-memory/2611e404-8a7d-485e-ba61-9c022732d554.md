## Thought

I can see the issue. The `ensureGitignore()` method on lines 193-214 has logic that checks if the `.gitignore` file exists using `fs.access()`. If it exists, it doesn't do anything. If it doesn't exist (the catch block), it creates the file.

However, looking at the git status, the file was deleted:
```
D local-recall/.gitignore
```

But the issue is that the `fs.access()` call will not throw an error if the file exists in the working directory (even if it's marked for deletion in git). So the code might think the file exists when it actually doesn't, or there might be another issue.

Actually, wait. Let me reconsider. The `fs.access()` will throw if the file doesn't exist on the filesystem. If the file is deleted from git but still exists on disk, it won't be recreated. But if it's been deleted from both git AND the filesystem, then it should be recreated.

Let me check if the `.gitignore` file actually exists on the filesystem.

## Output

I can see the issue. Let me check if the `.gitignore` file exists on the filesystem and investigate why it's not being created.
