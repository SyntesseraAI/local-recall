## Thought

The process is still hanging. It's been about 20+ seconds now. This confirms the issue - when Node.js spawns the claude CLI, it hangs and never produces output, even though the same command works when run directly from the shell.

This could be due to:
1. stdin being piped but not written to or closed
2. Some environment variable or inherited file descriptor issue
3. TTY detection causing claude to wait for something

Let me try closing stdin on the spawned process and see if that helps.

Actually, let me kill this process and try a different approach - using execFile or adding `shell: true` to the spawn options.

## Output

The process is hanging. This confirms the issue - the spawn works but the Claude CLI hangs when executed via Node.js's `spawn`. Let me kill this and try with `shell: true`:
