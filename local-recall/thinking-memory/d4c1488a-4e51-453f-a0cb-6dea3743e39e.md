## Thought

The plan has been approved. Now I need to start implementing. Let me create a todo list to track progress and begin with Phase 1: Core JSONL Infrastructure.

I'll start with:
1. Create `jsonl-types.ts` with Zod schemas
2. Create `jsonl-store.ts` (generic store)
3. Create `episodic-jsonl-store.ts`
4. Create `thinking-jsonl-store.ts`

Let me set up the todo list and begin implementation.

## Output

The plan is approved. Let me set up a todo list and begin implementation.
