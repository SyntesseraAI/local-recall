## Thought

Good, so each JSONL line with a thinking block contains a `content` array with one `type: "thinking"` object. Now the key question is: can there be multiple thinking blocks in a single content array?

Looking at the code and the transcript data, it appears:
1. Each JSONL line has a content array with typically ONE content block
2. Multiple lines are streamed with the same `message.id`
3. Each thinking block appears to be streamed as its own line

But the actual question is: can Claude produce multiple thinking blocks in a response? Yes - with interleaved thinking mode, Claude can have multiple `<thinking>` blocks interspersed with output.

Let me search for a transcript that shows this pattern - where the same message has multiple thinking entries.

## Output

Based on the data, each thinking block is streamed as a separate JSONL line. But the question is whether there can be **multiple** thinking blocks in a single Claude response (interleaved thinking). Let me check:
