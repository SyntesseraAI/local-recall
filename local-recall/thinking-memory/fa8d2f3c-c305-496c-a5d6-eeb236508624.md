I see the issue. The embedding service uses `fastembed` which requires downloading model files on first use. The error says:

```
Tokenizer file not found at local_cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json
```

It seems like the model files need to be downloaded or the fastembed library needs to download them. Let me check if there's a setup script or how fastembed downloads models. Let me also check package.json for any scripts that might handle this.
