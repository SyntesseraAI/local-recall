## Thought

The gitignore does not include `episodic.jsonl` or `thinking.jsonl` - which is correct because we WANT to track those in git. The old `episodic-memory/` and `thinking-memory/` folders are also not gitignored (they contain `*.md` files which are tracked).

Actually, I notice the old folders (`episodic-memory/`, `thinking-memory/`) are not mentioned in gitignore which means their `.md` files would be tracked. That's the old behavior. 

With the new JSONL format:
- `episodic.jsonl` and `thinking.jsonl` should be tracked (version controlled)
- The Orama index files should still be gitignored

The current gitignore is fine. Let me now update the todos and commit the changes.

## Output

The gitignore is already correct - it ignores the Orama index files but will track `episodic.jsonl` and `thinking.jsonl`. Let me update the todos and commit:
