## Thought

The user wants to test for mutex errors. Based on the context provided, including the memory about mutex lock errors, I understand that:

1. The mutex error "libc++abi: terminating due to uncaught exception of type std::__1::system_error: mutex lock failed: Invalid argument" was occurring when hooks directly loaded sqlite-vec
2. The project recently migrated from SQLite/sqlite-vec to Orama for vector search (as seen in the git commit "refactor: Replace SQLite/sqlite-vec with Orama for vector search")
3. The previous thinking memories indicate that the mutex errors should now be gone since Orama is pure JavaScript

However, I should verify the current state. Let me check what testing approach would be appropriate. Since the user just says "testing mutex", they probably want to verify that the mutex errors no longer occur with the new Orama-based implementation.

Let me search for how to test this or check the current implementation to understand what kind of mutex test would be relevant.

## Output

Based on the context, the mutex errors were caused by sqlite-vec native extension loading. The recent commit shows you migrated to Orama (pure JavaScript), so those errors should be gone.

To verify, I can simulate concurrent hook executions that would have previously triggered the mutex error:
