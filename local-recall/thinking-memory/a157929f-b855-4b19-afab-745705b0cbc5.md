## Thought

Now I can see the injected memories about stew! The JSON output format worked. The system-reminder now includes:

```
<system-reminder>
UserPromptSubmit hook additional context: # Local Recall: Relevant Memories

Found 5 memories related to your query.
...
</system-reminder>
```

This contains 5 memories about stew that were found and injected into my context. The fix worked!

## Output

Yes! The JSON format worked. I can now see 5 memories about stew injected into my context:

1. **The stew overview** I gave you earlier (types, what makes a good stew, best cuts)
2. **Me investigating** why hook output wasn't being injected
3. **My analysis** of the hook code and the keyword matching issue
4. **Your original query** about what we'd said about stew
5. **Finding the memory** that mentioned stew

The `additionalContext` field in the JSON output is now properly being injected as a `<system-reminder>` with the label "UserPromptSubmit hook additional context".

The fix was switching from plain `console.log()` statements to the structured JSON format:

```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "UserPromptSubmit",
    "additionalContext": "..."
  }
}
```

Memory injection is now working.
