## Thought

Now I understand. There's a `summarize.ts` file with a `generateSubject` function that uses the ts-textrank package. The user wants to simplify this by:
1. Removing the ts-textrank dependency
2. Simply taking text up to the first `.` or all text if no `.` is present

Let me also check where this `generateSubject` is being imported/used. Looking at the transcript.ts file, I see it has its own local `generateSubject` function, not importing from summarize.ts. So maybe the summarize.ts functions are used elsewhere.

Let me check where summarize.ts is imported:
